Abram and his family come up out of [Babylonia](/places/old-testament/genesis/babylonia) and into [Haran](/places/old-testament/genesis/haran) where the Lord promises that in him all the families of the earth shall be blessed (Gen 12:1-3).

When he is 75, the Lord calls him up out of Haran and into the land of Canaan where he brings his family including Sarai and Lot (Gen 12:4-5).

The Lord visits him at [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) and tells him he will give his offspring the land of the Canaanites. He builds an altar to the Lord there (Gen. 12:7).

Abram sets up camp between [Bethel](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethel) and [Ai](/places/old-testament/genesis/ai) and builds an altar to the Lord there (Gen 12:8).

He journeys down into the [Negeb](/places/old-testament/genesis/negeb) and there is a famine in the land, so he and Sarai go to Egypt (Gen. 12:9-10). Afraid for his life, he tells Pharaoh that Sarai is his sister, and she is taken into Pharaoh's house (Gen. 12:13-15). God raises up Abram and Sarai with livestock, servants, silver, and gold (Gen. 12:16) (Gen. 13:2), afflicts Pharaoh with plagues (Gen. 12:17), and sends Abram and Sarai back into Canaan (Gen. 12:20).

Abram goes back to the place between Bethel and Ai, and the Lord had blessed Abram and Lot so greatly that they had to separate (Gen. 13:3-6). Abram goes down to [Hebron](/places/old-testament/genesis/hebron), and Lot unknowingly goes to [Sodom](/places/old-testament/genesis/sodom) because it is well watered (Gen. 13:12). God reaffirms his promise to Abram at Hebron, and he builds an altar to the Lord there (Gen. 13:14-18).

Four mighty Babylonian kings (Gen. 14:1-2), who had defeated giants (Gen. 14:5), war against five kings of the Jordan Valley (Gen. 14:8-9), and dispossess their land and capture Lot (Gen. 14:11-12). Abram fashions an army of 318 men, defeats the Babylonian kings, returns the possessions, and rescues Lot (Gen. 14:14-16). Abram then goes to [Jerusalem](/places/old-testament/genesis/jerusalem) where Melchizedek, a famous king and priest whose name means "King of Righteousness", brings out bread and wine and blesses Abram. Abram gives him a tithe (Gen. 14:17-20). The king of Sodom wants to let Abram keep the riches, but he humbly keeps nothing, giving all the glory to God (Gen. 14:21-24).

God makes a covenant with Abram. Abram believes and is counted as righteous (Gen. 15:4-6). God foretells of the Israelites' 400 years in Egypt and subsequent return to Canaan (Gen. 15:13-16). God gives Abraham a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch as a sign of the covenant, and they pass between the carcasses of animals (a rite or custom used in making and confirming covenants in those times) (Gen. 15:17-21) (Jer. 34:18).

When Abraham is 86, he and Sarai become impatient and conceive a child through Sarai's Egyptian servant Hagar (Gen. 16:1-2) (Gen 16:16). Hagar looks on Sarai with contempt, and Sarai deals harshly with her (Gen. 16:6), so Hagar flees into the desert where the angel of the Lord comforts her and asks her to submit to Sarai (Gen. 16:7-10).

When Abram is 99, the Lord appears to him and asks him to walk before him and be blameless, that he may make his covenant with him, and multiply him greatly (Gen. 17:1-2). God changes his name from Abram (אַבְרָם, *ʾaḇrām*, "exalted father") to Abraham (אַבְרָהָם, *'aḇrāhām*, "father of a multitude") (Gen. 17:5), and changes the name of Sarai (שָׂרָי, *śārāy*, "my princess") to Sarah (שָׂרָה, *śārâ*, "princess [to all]") (Gen. 17:15). God reaffirms his covenant with Abraham and makes circumcision the sign of the covenant (Gen. 17:10). God says nations and even kings will come from him (Gen. 17:6). God then promises that Abraham and Sarah will conceive a son named [Isaac](/people/patriarchs/isaac), and that he will establish an everlasting covenant with him and is offspring (Gen. 17:19). Abraham has his whole house circumcised (Gen. 17:23).

Abraham is visited by three angels in Hebron, and he shows them hospitality (Gen. 18:1-4) (Gen. 19:1) (Heb. 13:2). They tell him when Isaac will be born (Gen. 18:10), and Sarah laughs because of her age, but the Lord tells Abraham nothing is impossible for God (Gen. 18:13-14). They also tell him that Sodom and Gomorrah may be destroyed for their great sin, and Abraham intercedes, that the righteous not be swept away with the wicked (Gen. 18:22-23). God then rescues Lot on account of Abraham before he destroys Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:29).

Abraham goes to the Negeb and lives between [Kadesh-barnea](/places/old-testament/genesis/kadesh-barnea) and [Shur](/places/old-testament/genesis/shur). Then he goes to [Gerar](/places/old-testament/genesis/gerar) in the territory of the Philistines (Gen. 20:1). Abraham tells Abimelech that Sarah is his sister, and she is taken into Abimelech's house (Gen. 20:2). God afflicts Abimelech on account of Abraham, whom he calls a prophet (Gen. 20:7), and again raises him up with livestock, servants, and silver; and Abimelech allows Abraham to dwell safely in the land (Gen. 20:14-16). Abraham's intercession heals Abimelech and all his house (Gen. 20:17-18).

When Abraham is 100, Isaac is born to Sarah as the Lord promised (Gen. 21:5).

Abraham makes a feast for Isaac on the day he is weaned, but Ishmael mocks him, so Sarah tells Abraham to cast him and Hagar out (Gen. 21:8-10). Abraham is displeased, but God tells Abraham not to worry because he will make Ishmael a nation, and that Isaac is the son of the promise (Gen. 21:11-12). Hagar and Ismael are cast out, but God protects them in the desert from dying of thirst, and Ishmael goes on to be a mighty hunter in [Paran](/places/old-testament/genesis/paran) (Gen. 21:19-21).

Abraham builds a well in the Negeb that Abimelech's servants seize (Gen. 21:25-26), but seeing that God was with Abraham, Abimelech sought to make a covenant with him (Gen. 21:22-23). Abraham sets apart seven ewe lambs from his flock as a witness that he dug the well, and Abraham and Abimelech make an oath there, thus the name of the place is called Beersheba ("well of seven" or "well of the oath") (Gen. 21:29-31). Abraham plants a tamarisk tree there, and calls on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God (Gen. 21:33).

God, having confidence in Abraham's faith and foreknowledge of his obedience, tests Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his only son Isaac on [Mount Moriah](/places/old-testament/genesis/mount-moriah) (Gen 22:1-2). Right as he is about to do so, God stops him (Gen. 22:11-12) and affirms that because he has not withheld his only son, God will fulfill his covenant with Abraham, and that all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in his offspring (Gen. 22:15-18). God provides a ram as a substitute for Isaac, and Abraham calls the place YHWH-jireh (יהוה יראה, "the Lord sees" or "the Lord provides") as it was said, "On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided" (Gen. 22:13-14).

Sarah passes away in Hebron. Abraham goes to the Hittites, who recognize him as a prince of God and give him the cave at Machpelah for 400 shekels as a burial place. Abraham mourns for Sarah and buries Sarah there.

Abraham, concerned that his son Isaac would intermarry with the Canaanites, turns to his servant Eliezer (Gen. 15:2) and asks him to travel from the Negeb to Haran (over 600 miles away, about a 10-days journey) to find a wife for Isaac from the land of his kindred (Gen. 24:2-4). Abraham says the Lord will send his angel before Eliezer on his journey (Gen. 24:7). Eliezer humbly complies and makes an oath with Abraham, and heads off to Haran (Gen. 24:10). There, according to God's perfect timing, he meets Rebekah, and she and her family agree it's the Lords will for her to marry Isaac (Gen. 24:50-51) (Gen. 24:58). As Isaac goes out to meditate in the field, he sees Rebekah arriving. They are soon after married, and Isaac loves her and is comforted after his mother's death (Gen. 24:63-67).

Abraham remarries a woman named Keturah (Gen. 25:1), and at the end of his life, he gives gifts to all his children and sends them eastward (Gen. 25:6), but to Isaac he gives all that he has and blesses him (Gen. 25:5) (Gen. 25:11). Abraham passes away in a good old age. Isaac and Ishmael bury him at Machpelah with Sarah (Gen. 25:8-10).
