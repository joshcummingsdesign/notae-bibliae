After Abraham dies, Isaac then settles in [Beer-lahai-roi](/places/old-testament/genesis/beer-lahai-roi) (Gen. 25:11). Rebekah cannot conceive, so Isaac prays to the Lord, and the Lord answers his prayer (Gen. 25:21). Rebekah has a difficult pregnancy, so she prays and God reveals to her that there are two nations within her, and that the older shall serve the younger (Gen. 25:22-23). She gives birth to twins (Gen. 22:24). The first is named Esau (עֵשָׂו, ʿēśāw), which means means "well-made", for he was hairy like a cloak (Gen. 25:25). The second is holding Esau's heel, so he is named Jacob (יַעֲקֹב, yaʿăqōḇ), which means "he who takes by the heel" or "supplanter" (Gen. 25:26).

Esau treats his birthright as nothing and sells it to Jacob for some red stew. Thus, he is also called Edom (אֱדוֹם,'Ĕḏōm), which means "red" (Gen. 25:30-34). Esau then marries two Hittite women, who make life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah (Gen. 26:34-35).

Isaac settles in [Gerar](/places/old-testament/genesis/gerar) (Gen. 26:1), and then in [Beersheba](/places/old-testament/genesis/beersheba) (Gen. 26:23-25). When Isaac is old and his eyes are dim, he is unsure how much longer he will live so he prepares to bless Esau (Gen. 27:1-4). Rebekah, knowing Jacob is the son of the promise—though she needed not intervene in the work of God—tells Jacob to pretend to be Esau so he may receive the blessing (Gen. 27:5-10). Jacob knows this is wrong, but Rebekah, being confident in God's promises, says that she will take the blame for any wrongdoing (Gen. 27:11-13). Jacob goes on to lie to his father to receive the blessing (Gen. 27:18-19), but the Holy Spirit prompts Isaac to bless Jacob, as he is the son of the promise (Gen. 27:28-29). Esau returns for his blessing, and Isaac fears for he realizes that he had rightly blessed Jacob (Gen. 27:32-33). Though Esau had already sold his birthright, the anger in his heart is revealed and he looks to kill his brother Jacob (Gen. 27:41). Afraid for Jacob's life, Rebekah tells him to flee to her brother Laban in [Haran](/places/old-testament/genesis/haran) (Gen. 27:43). Rebekah also desires that Jacob not intermarry with the Canaanites (Gen. 27:46).

Isaac does not rebuke Jacob, but rather confirms the blessing, and affirms that God's promise to Abraham will be fulfilled through him (Gen. 28:3-4). Just as with Abraham, Isaac is concerned that his son Jacob would intermarry with the Canaanites, so he sends him to Haran to find a wife from the land of his kindred (Gen. 28:1-2).

On his way to Haran, Jacob stops in [Luz](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethel) to rest for the night (Gen. 28:10-11). God then sends him a vision of a ladder reaching to heaven upon which the angels of God are ascending and descending (Gen. 28:12). God then reaffirms to him the promise he made to Abraham and Isaac (Gen. 28:13-14), and promises to be with him wherever he goes and bring him back to the land (Gen. 28:15). Jacob renames the place Bethel (Hebrew: בֵּית אֵל, "house of God") (Gen. 28:17-19) and sets up a stone pillar as a memorial (Gen. 28:18). Jacob makes a vow to the Lord that when he returns safely, he will worship him and give him a tenth of everything (Gen. 28:20-22).

As Jacob draws closer to Haran, he comes to a well covered with a large stone and three flocks of sheep (Gen. 29:1-3). Jacob finds out that the shepherds are from Haran, that they know his uncle Laban, and that Laban's daughter Rachel, a shepherdess, is on her way (Gen. 29:4-6). God led Jacob to the well according to his perfect timing because all the shepherds had to be together to move the stone and water the sheep, and they were waiting for Rachel (Gen. 29:7-8). Jacob sees Rachel, and God gives Jacob the strength to move the stone and water the sheep (Gen. 29:10). Jacob greets Rachel and weeps (Gen. 29:11). Rachel tells Laban the news about Jacob, and Laban takes Jacob to his house in Haran and he stays there a month (Gen. 29:12-14).

Jacob begins to work for Laban, and Laban asks him what his wages should be (Gen. 29:15). Jacob loves Rachel, and so asks for her hand in marriage (Gen. 29:18). Jacob agrees to work for Laban for seven years for her hand in marriage, but to him they seem as but a few days because of his love for her (Gen. 29:20). At the end of the seven years, Laban throws a wedding feast, but deceives Jacob by sending in Rachel's older sister Leah during the marriage consummation (Gen. 29:21-23). When Jacob asks Laban why he did this, he tells him that their tradition holds that the older daughter must be given before the younger (Gen. 29:25-26). Laban asks Jacob to take responsibility as Leah's husband, and tells him that he can marry Rachel after another seven years (Gen. 29:27). Jacob, trusting God's sovereignty, takes responsibility as Leah's husband, and then works yet another seven years for Rachel's hand in marriage (Gen. 29:28). But because there was contempt for Leah, God graciously gives her four children: Reuben, Simeon, Levi (from whom shall come the priestly family), and Judah (from whom shall come the Messiah – מָשִׁיחַ, *māšîaḥ*, "the anointed one") (Gen. 29:31).

To Jacob's dismay, Rachel becomes impatient (Gen. 30:1-2), and has Jacob conceive through her servant Bilhah (Gen. 30:3). Bilhah has Dan and Naphtali (Gen. 30:6-8). Leah also ceases bearing children and has Jacob conceive through her servant Zilpah (Gen. 30:9). Zilpah has Gad and Asher (Gen. 30:10-13). Leah prays for another child, and God answers her prayer with two sons named Issachar and Zebulun (Gen. 30:17-20), and a daughter named Dinah (Gen. 30:21). Rachel prays for another child, and God answers her prayer with a son named Joseph (Gen. 30:22-24).

Jacob, who had fulfilled his service to Laban, and who now had 11 sons, asks Laban to let him return home with Leah and Rachel and his children (Gen. 30:25-26). According to tradition, Laban was to provide a dowry to help Leah and Rachel establish their family, but Laban kept the money for himself (Gen. 31:14-15) and through Jacob had become very prosperous (Gen. 30:27). Because of this, he didn't want Jacob to leave, and agreed to give him whatever he wanted (Gen. 30:28). Jacob asks for every speckled and spotted sheep among the flock (Gen. 30:32-33). Laban agrees (Gen. 30:34), but then deceitfully removes them from the flock and sends them away with his sons (Gen. 30:35-36). Despite Laban's actions, God raises Jacob up over the next six years with all kinds of spotted and speckled sheep (Gen. 31:6-8) and makes him very prosperous (Gen. 30:43), but Laban and his sons accuse Jacob of stealing from them (Gen. 31:1-2). Finally, after twenty years of service to Laban (Gen. 31:41), God tells Jacob to return home (Gen. 31:3) (Gen. 31:11-13). Jacob then gathers his family and his possessions and flees to [Gilead](/places/old-testament/genesis/gilead). As they are leaving, Rachel steals Laban's household idols—perhaps because she believed that they would help Laban find out where they fled to (Gen. 31:19-21).

Someone tells Laban that Jacob fled, and Laban catches up with Jacob in Gilead (Gen 31:22-23). God tells Laban not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad (Gen. 31:24). Despite this warning, Laban confronts Jacob for fleeing (Gen. 31:26). Laban asks where his household idols are, and Jacob, not knowing Rachel had taken them, permits him to search for them (Gen. 31:32). Rachel hides them in the camel's saddle in her tent and sits on it (Gen. 31:34). She tells Laban that the way of the woman is upon her, so he doesn't find them (Gen. 31:35). Jacob then rebukes Laban for deceiving him, and tells him that God has surely been on Jacob's side (Gen. 31:41-42). Laban, realizing Jacob is right, asks to make a covenant with him (Gen. 31:44). They set up a pillar as a witness and a watchpost for the Lord to watch between them, which is how Gilead and Mizpah get their names respectively (Gen. 31:46-49). Jacob then offers a sacrifice to the Lord (Gen. 31:54). Laban blesses his children and returns home (Gen. 31:55).

Jacob stops in [Mahanaim](/places/old-testament/genesis/mahanaim), and is visited by angels (Gen. 32:1-2). Then, remembering his brother, Jacob sends messengers to Esau (Gen. 32:3). He finds out Esau is coming to meet him, and he is greatly afraid (Gen. 32:6-8). Jacob turns to God in humility, and acknowledges how God had raised him up (Gen. 32:9-10). He confesses his fear and asks God for deliverance from his brother's hand (Gen. 32:11), yet remembers the promise God had made to him (Gen. 32:12). Jacob then sends gifts ahead of him in hopes of appeasing his brother Esau (Gen. 32:13) (Gen. 32:16-18) (Gen. 32:19-20).

Jacob sends his family across the [Jabbok River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jabbok-river), and when he is alone, a man comes upon him, and they begin to wrestle (Gen. 32:22-24). The man then touches Jacob's hip and it is put out of joint, thus Jacob realizes the man is the Lord (Gen. 32:25). The Lord asks Jacob to let him go, but Jacob says, "I will not let you go unless you bless me" (Gen. 32:26). The Lord then renames him Israel (יִשְׂרָאֵל, *yisra'él*, "he prevails with God", or "prince with God") (Gen. 32:27-28), and blesses him. Thus, through his wrestling, Jacob clung to God in faith and prevailed, and was blessed among men. Jacob asks the Lord his name, but he doesn't yet reveal it (Gen. 32:29). Jacob then calls the place [Peniel](/places/old-testament/genesis/penuel) (פְּנִיאֵל, "the face of God"), for he says he has seen the "face of God" (meaning a theophany) and lived (Gen. 32:30). To this day the Jews don't eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket in memory of this event (Gen. 32:32).

Jacob sees Esau coming with 400 men and bows himself to the ground seven times until he comes near his brother (Gen. 33:1-3). Esau runs to meet him, embraces him, and they weep (Gen. 33:4). God answered Jacob's prayer, and worked love into Esau's heart. Esau kindly refuses the gifts from Jacob, but Jacob explains that God has blessed him, and he insists (Gen. 33:9-11). Esau invites Jacob to go with him to Seir, but since Jacob has his family and his livestock, he tells Esau to go ahead (Gen. 33:12-14). Jacob then stops in [Succoth](/places/old-testament/genesis/succoth) (Gen. 33:16-17), and then heads out to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem), where he buys some land and builds an altar to the Lord, for God had brought him back to the land safely as promised (Gen. 33:18-20).

Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite defiles Jacob's daughter Dinah (Gen. 34:1-2). Hamor speaks with Simeon and Levi and says that their peoples should intermarry (Gen. 34:7-9), and Simeon and Levi deceitfully tell him they will agree if Hamor's house is circumcised (Gen. 34:13-15). After they are sore, Simeon and Levi come against the city and kill every male and plunder it (Gen. 34:25-29). Jacob is deeply troubled and confronts his sons for bringing trouble on him in the land of the Canaanites and Perizzites (Gen. 34:30).

God tells Jacob to return to Bethel and build an altar to he Lord there, where he had made a vow to the Lord some twenty years prior (Gen. 35:1). Jacob tells his family to put away their foreign Gods (Gen. 35:2), and tells them how God has been with him (Gen. 35:3). God then protects them on their journey (Gen. 35:5). When they arrive in Bethel, God appears to Jacob and reaffirms that his name shall be Israel (Gen. 35:9-10), and that the promise he made to Abraham and Isaac will carry on through him, that nations and even kings will come from him, and that he and his offspring will inherit the promised land (Gen. 35:11-12). Jacob sets up another stone pillar there as a memorial (Gen. 35:14).

Jacob and his family go from Bethel to [Hebron](/places/old-testament/genesis/hebron) to see Isaac, but when they get near Bethlehem, Rachel goes into labor (Gen. 35:16). There are complications during the birth, and she begins to die, but before she dies she has a son named Ben-oni (Hebrew: בֶּן־אוֹנִי, "son of my sorrow"), but Jacob calls him Benjamin (Hebrew: בִּנְיָמִין, "son of the right hand") (Gen. 35:17-18). Sadly, she dies after giving birth, and Jacob has to bury his beloved wife (Gen. 35:19). He sets up a stone pillar over her tomb (Gen. 35:20). To make matters worse, when Jacob and his family arrive in Bethlehem, Reuben lies with Rachel's servant Bilhah. Further, when Jacob arrives in Hebron, Isaac passes away, and Esau and Jacob burry him at Machpelah.

Just as with Abraham and Lot, the Lord had blessed Jacob and Esau so greatly that they remained separated—Esau in Seir and Jacob in Canaan (Gen. 36:6-8) (Gen. 37:1).

Out of jealousy, all Jacob's sons, except for Reuben (and Benjamin who is too young), sell Joseph to some Ishmaelites who take him to Egypt to be sold as a slave (Gen. 37:28). God raises Joseph up to be second in command over all Egypt (Gen. 41:39-40), and ultimately reconciles and saves his whole family from a famine (Gen. 45:4-7). Joseph arranges for Jacob and all his house to travel to Egypt (Gen. 45:13). On the way, Jacob stops in Beersheba where the Lord speaks to him in a vision and tells him that he will protect him on his journey and bring him back to the land in safety (Gen. 46:1-4). Then Jacob and all his house go to [Goshen](/places/old-testament/genesis/goshen) to dwell safely in Egypt (Gen. 46:29-30), and they are put in charge of Pharaoh's livestock (Gen. 47:6).

Jacob's family is fruitful and multiplies in the land of Egypt. Jacob reaches the end of his life at 147 years of age (Gen. 47:27-28), and has Joseph promise to carry him out of Egypt and burry him at Machpelah with his fathers (Gen. 47:29-31). Jacob then blesses Manasseh and Ephraim, and says they will be counted as his own in the inheritance (Gen. 48:5). He places his right hand on Ephraim, even though he was the younger, to prophetically proclaim that he would be the greater (Joshua descends from his line) (Gen. 48:14). He then gives Joseph a double portion of the inheritance in the land near Shechem, and prophesies that it will be taken from the Amorites as God had promised (Gen. 48:21-22). After blessing all his sons, Jacob breathes his last and is gathered to his people (Gen. 49:33). Joseph and all his brothers bury Jacob at Machpelah as promised (Gen. 50:13-14).
