When Abraham is 99 (Gen. 17:1), God promises that he and Sarah will conceive a son (Gen. 17:15-16). Abraham falls on his face and laughs because they are so old, so God tells them his name shall be Isaac (יצחק, *yiṣḥāq*, "he laughs"), and that he will establish an everlasting covenant with him and is offspring (Gen. 17:17-19). When Abraham is visited by three angels (Gen. 18:1-4), they tell him when Isaac will be born (Gen. 18:10), and Sarah laughs because of her age, but the Lord tells Abraham nothing is impossible for God (Gen. 18:13-14).

When Abraham is 100, Isaac is born to Sarah as the Lord promised (Gen. 21:5).

Abraham makes a feast for Isaac on the day he is weaned, but Ishmael mocks him, so Sarah tells Abraham to cast him and Hagar out. Abraham is displeased, but God tells Abraham not to worry because he will make Ishmael a nation, and that Isaac is the son of the promise.

God, having confidence in Abraham's faith and foreknowledge of his obedience, tests Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his only son Isaac on [Mount Moriah](/places/old-testament/genesis/mount-moriah) (Gen 22:1-2). Right as he is about to do so, God stops him (Gen. 22:11-12) and affirms that because he has not withheld his only son, God will fulfill his covenant with Abraham, and that all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in his offspring (Gen. 22:15-18). God provides a ram as a substitute for Isaac, and Abraham calls the place YHWH-jireh (יהוה יראה, "the Lord sees" or "the Lord provides") as it was said, "On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided" (Gen. 22:13-14).

Sarah passes away in [Hebron](/places/old-testament/genesis/hebron). Abraham goes to the Hittites, who recognize him as a prince of God and give him the cave at Machpelah for 400 shekels as a burial place. Abraham mourns for Sarah and buries Sarah there.

Abraham, concerned that his son Isaac would intermarry with the Canaanites, turns to his servant Eliezer (Gen. 15:2) and asks him to travel from the [Negeb](/places/old-testament/genesis/negeb) to [Haran](/places/old-testament/genesis/haran) (over 600 miles away, about a 10-days journey) to find a wife for Isaac from the land of his kindred (Gen. 24:2-4). Abraham says the Lord will send his angel before Eliezer on his journey (Gen. 24:7). Eliezer humbly complies and makes an oath with Abraham, and heads off to Haran (Gen. 24:10). There, according to God's perfect timing, he meets Rebekah, and she and her family agree it's the Lords will for her to marry Isaac (Gen. 24:50-51) (Gen. 24:58). As Isaac goes out to meditate in the field, he sees Rebekah arriving. They are soon after married, and Isaac loves her and is comforted after his mother's death (Gen. 24:63-67).

Abraham remarries a woman named Keturah (Gen. 25:1), and at the end of his life, he gives gifts to all his children and sends them eastward (Gen. 25:6), but to Isaac he gives all that he has and blesses him (Gen. 25:5) (Gen. 25:11). Abraham passes away in a good old age. Isaac and Ishmael bury him at Machpelah with Sarah (Gen. 25:8-10). Isaac then settles in [Beer-lahhai-roi](/places/old-testament/genesis/beer-lahhai-roi) (Gen. 25:11).

Rebekah cannot conceive, so Isaac prays to the Lord, and the Lord answers his prayer (Gen. 25:21). Rebekah has a difficult pregnancy, so she prays and God reveals to her that there are two nations within her (Gen. 25:22-23). She gives birth to twins (Gen. 22:24). The first is named Esau (עֵשָׂו, ʿēśāw), which means means "well-made", for he was hairy like a cloak (Gen. 25:25). The second is holding Esau's heel, so he is named Jacob (יַעֲקֹב, yaʿăqōḇ), which means "he who takes by the heel" or "supplanter" (Gen. 25:26).

Just as with Abraham, there is a famine in the land, so Isaac goes to [Gerar](/places/old-testament/genesis/gerar), and thinks about going down to Egypt as his father did (Gen. 26:1). God appears to Isaac, and tells him to stay in the land, and affirms that his promise to Abraham will carry on through Isaac (Gen. 26:2-3), and that all the nations of the earth will be blessed in his offspring (Gen. 26:4-5).

Just as with Abraham, Isaac is afraid for his life and tells Abimelech that Rebekah is his sister (Gen. 26:6-7). Abimelech sees Isaac laughing with Rebekah, and asks why he lied to him (Gen. 26:8-9). Abimelech, afraid that guilt could come upon the Philistines, protects Isaac and Rebekah (Gen. 26:10-11). God blesses and raises up Isaac and Rebekah so much that they are sent away from Abimelech (Gen. 26:12-14) (Gen. 26:16).

After Abraham had died, the Philistines filled up the wells that he dug (Gen. 26:15), so Isaac begins to dig them again (Gen. 26:18). Twice there is quarreling with the herdsman of Gerar (Gen. 26:19-21), but the third time there is no quarreling because God had made room for them (Gen. 26:22).

Isaac goes to [Beersheba](/places/old-testament/genesis/beersheba), and the Lord appears to him there and reaffirms his promise that he will bless him and multiply his offspring. Isaac then builds an altar there. (Gen. 26:23-25).

Just as with Abraham, Abimelech sees that God is with Isaac, and looks to make a covenant with him (Gen. 26:26-28). They make a covenant at Beersheba (Gen. 26:31-33).

When Isaac is old and his eyes are dim, he is unsure how much longer he will live so he prepares to bless Esau (Gen. 27:1-4). Rebekah, knowing Jacob is the son of the promise—though she needed not intervene in the work of God—tells Jacob to pretend to be Esau so he may receive the blessing (Gen. 27:5-10). Jacob knows this is wrong, but Rebekah, being confident in God's promises, says that she will take the blame for any wrongdoing (Gen. 27:11-13). Jacob goes on to lie to his father to receive the blessing (Gen. 27:18-19), but the Holy Spirit prompts Isaac to bless Jacob, as he is the son of the promise (Gen. 27:28-29). Esau returns for his blessing, and Isaac fears for he realizes that he had rightly blessed Jacob (Gen. 27:32-33). Though Esau had already sold his birthright, the anger in his heart is revealed and he looks to kill his brother Jacob (Gen. 27:41). Afraid for Jacob's life, Rebekah tells him to flee to her brother Laban in Haran (Gen. 27:43). Rebekah also desires that Jacob not intermarry with the Canaanites (Gen. 27:46).

Isaac does not rebuke Jacob, but rather confirms the blessing, and affirms that God's promise to Abraham will be fulfilled through him (Gen. 28:3-4). Just as with Abraham, Isaac is concerned that his son Jacob would intermarry with the Canaanites, so he sends him to Haran to find a wife from the land of his kindred (Gen. 28:1-2).

Jacob returns to the land after over twenty years (Gen. 31:41). During that time, Jacob had twelve sons (Gen. 35:23-26). Jacob goes to his father Isaac at Hebron where Isaac breaths his last and is buried by Esau and Jacob at Machpelah (Gen. 35:27-29).
