## The Gospel of Matthew

[St. Matthew's](/people/saints/apostles/matthew) primary lens is Jesus as King. Thus, he begins his genealogy with Abraham and continues to David, then traces the succession of kings beginning with Solomon, pausing at Jehoiachin (also called Jeconiah or Coniah) to highlight the Babylonian exile. This pause is significant, because before the exile Jeremiah had prophesied that none of Jehoiachin's descendants would sit on the throne of David (Jer. 22:28-30), showing that the Messiah could not come directly from his line. It appears that Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel (Ezra 3:2)—through whom the Messianic promise would be fulfilled (Hag. 2:23)—and that Shealtiel was brought into the house of Jehoiachin through levirate marriage, which would explain why he is later listed as Jehoiachin's son (1 Chron. 3:17-18). Likewise, it appears that when Shealtiel died, Zerubbabel was brought into the house of Pedaiah, Jehoiachin's son (1 Chron. 3:19). From there, St. Matthew continues his genealogy with Zerubbabel's descendant Abiud, finally arriving at Jacob, the father of [St. Joseph](/people/saints/biblical/joseph).

For didactic purposes, St. Matthew points out that from Abraham to David there were 14 generations; from David to the Babylonian exile there were 14 generations—that is, from David to Josiah; and from the Babylonian exile to Christ there were 14 generations—that is, from Jehoiachin to Jesus. St. Matthew uses the three groups of 14 to highlight both the perfection of Christ and the history of God's family (Matt. 1:17).

The chart below includes the names not mentioned by St. Matthew in parentheses so that it harmonizes with the rest of Scripture.

## The Gospel of Luke

[St. Luke's](/people/saints/evangelists/luke) primary lens is Jesus as man. Thus, he begins his genealogy with St. Joseph, whom—unlike St. Matthew—he identifies as the son of Heli. [St. John of Damascus](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-of-damascus) states that St. Joseph was the biological son of Jacob but the legal son of Heli through levirate marriage.[^1]

From Heli, St. Luke traces back to Zerubbabel through his descendant Rhesa. He tells us that Shealtiel's biological father's name was Neri, and traces his ancestry back to David's son Nathan, appropriately ending Jesus' genealogy with "the son of Adam, the son of God" (Luke 3:38).

Most modern translations include "Cainan, the son of Arpachshad" (Luke 3:36), however, this name does not appear in the Hebrew Scriptures nor in the earliest Septuagint witnesses (Gen. 10:24), nor is it found in the earliest Greek manuscripts of Luke. Similarly, some translations include "Admin, the son of Arni" (Luke 3:33), yet these names appear nowhere else in Scripture (1 Chron. 2:9-10) and are absent from the Textus Receptus.

## St. John of Damascus

St. John of Damascus states that [St. Mary's](/people/saints/biblical/mary) parents were [Saints Joachim and Anne](/people/saints/biblical/joachim-and-anne), and that St. Joachim was the son of Barpanther, the son of Panther, the son of Levi, the ancestor of Heli from the line of David's son Nathan. Thus, St. Joseph and St. Joachim were cousins, and St. Mary was from the line of David.[^2]
