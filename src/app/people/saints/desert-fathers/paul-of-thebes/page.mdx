<Initial text="Paul of Thebes"/>

[St. Paul of Thebes](/glossary/names#paul) (227–341 AD) was born in the Thebaid of Egypt (the southernmost part of Upper Egypt). Paul and his sister lost their parents. Paul's brother-in-law sought his inheritance, so they went to the governor to judge between them. On their way, they saw a funeral procession. Paul asked one of the mourners about the deceased man. Paul was told that he was one of the noble and rich people of the city, and that he left his riches and his wealth behind, and that they were taking him to bury him with only his garment. Paul thought to himself, "What do I have to do then with all the money of this temporal world which I shall leave naked?" He looked to his brother-in-law and said to him, "My brother, let us return, for I shall not ask you for anything, not even for what is mine." Paul found a grave where he stayed for three days praying to the Lord Christ to guide him to what pleases him. Eventually Paul's brother-in-law sought to betray him, and planned to take advantage of the persecution then raging in Egypt and denounce him as a Christian.

Paul fled to the Theban desert in Egypt (modern day Luxor) during the persecution of Decius and Valerianus around 250 AD, however, he soon fell in love with this new life and stayed. He spent the rest of his life (almost a hundred years) in prayer and solitude in the desert. From this life, the order named after him would take its motto, *Solus cum Deo solo* (Latin: "Alone with God alone").

He lived in the mountains of this desert in a cave near a clear spring and a palm tree, the leaves of which provided him with clothing and the fruit of which provided him with his only source of food until he was 43 years old, when a raven started bringing him half a loaf of bread daily.

Around the year 342 AD, an angel visited [St. Anthony](/people/saints/desert-fathers/anthony-the-great) and told him, "There is a man who lives in the inner wilderness; the world is not worthy of his footsteps. By his prayers, the Lord brings rain and dew to fall on the Earth, and bring the flood of the Nile in its due season." When Anthony heard this, he rose right away and went to the inner wilderness, a distance of one day's walk. God guided him to the cave of Paul. He entered, and they bowed to each other, and sat down talking about the greatness of the Lord.

In the evening, the raven came bringing a whole loaf of bread. Paul said to Anthony, "Now, I know that you are one of the children of God. For 70 years, the Lord has been sending to me everyday, half a loaf of bread, but today, the Lord is sending your food also. Now, go and bring me back in a hurry the tunic that Emperor Constantine had given to Pope Athanasius."

Anthony went to [St. Athanasius](/people/saints/greek-fathers/athanasius-of-alexandria), and brought the tunic from him and returned to Paul. When he returned, he found that Paul had departed from this world. He kissed him, weeping, and clothed him in the tunic that he asked for, and he took his fiber tunic.

As Anthony was wondering how he would bury Paul, two lions entered the cave and bowed their heads before the body of Paul. Anthony knew that they were sent from God. He marked the length and width of the body on the ground, and they dug the grave with their claws.

Anthony returned to his monastery taking with him the fiber tunic. He honored it so much that he only wore it twice a year: Easter and Pentecost.
