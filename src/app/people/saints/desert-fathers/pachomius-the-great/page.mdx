<Initial text="Pachomius the Great"/>

[St. Pachomius the Great](/glossary/names#pachomius) (290–348 AD) was born in Thebaid (near modern-day Luxor, Egypt) to pagan parents. When he was 21, he was swept up against his will in a Roman army recruitment drive, a common occurrence during this period of turmoil and civil war. With several other youths, he was put onto a ship that floated down the Nile and arrived at Thebes in the evening. There he first encountered local Christians, who customarily brought food and comfort daily to the conscripted troops. This made a lasting impression, and Pachomius vowed to investigate Christianity further when he got out. He was able to leave the army without ever having to fight, and was converted and baptized in 314.

Pachomius then came into contact with several well known ascetics and decided to pursue that path under the guidance of the hermit named Palaemon in 317. One of his devotions, popular at the time, was praying with his arms stretched out in the form of a cross. After studying seven years with Palaemon, Pachomius set out to lead the life of a hermit near [St. Anthony](/people/saints/desert-fathers/anthony-the-great), whose practices he imitated until Pachomius heard a voice in Tabennisi that told him to build a dwelling for the hermits to come to. An earlier ascetic named Macarius had created a number of proto-monasteries called lavra, or cells, where holy men who were physically or mentally unable to achieve the rigors of Anthony's solitary life would live in a community setting.

Pachomius established his first monastery between 318 and 323 at Tabennisi, Egypt. His elder brother John joined him, and soon more than 100 monks lived nearby. Pachomius set about organizing these cells into a formal organization. Until then, Christian asceticism had been solitary or eremitic with male or female monastics living in individual huts or caves and meeting only for occasional worship services. Pachomius created the community or <Definition lang="greek" anchor="koinobion" text="cenobitic" /> organization, in which male or female monastics lived together and held their property in common under the leadership of an abbot or abbess.

Pachomius realized that some men, acquainted only with the eremitical life, might speedily become disgusted if the distracting cares of the cenobitical life were thrust too abruptly upon them. He therefore allowed them to devote their whole time to spiritual exercises, undertaking all the community's administrative tasks himself. The community hailed Pachomius as "Abba" ("father" in Aramaic), from which "Abbot" derives. The monastery at Tabennisi, though enlarged several times, soon became too small and a second was founded at Pbow. This monastery at Pbow would go on to become the center for monasteries springing up along the Nile in Upper Egypt. Both of these are believed to have initially been abandoned villages, which were then repurposed for Pachomius' vision of his *Koinonia*. After 336, Pachomius spent most of his time at Pbow.

Though Pachomius sometimes acted as lector for nearby shepherds, neither he nor any of his monks became priests. In 333, Athanasius visited and wished to ordain him, but Pachomius fled from him. Athanasius' visit was probably a result of Pachomius' zealous defense of orthodoxy against Arianism. [St. Basil](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/basil-the-great) visited, then took many of Pachomius' ideas, which he adapted and implemented in Caesarea. This ascetic rule, or Ascetica, is still used today by the Eastern Orthodox Church, comparable to that of the Rule of St. Benedict in the West.

Pachomius was the first to set down a written monastic rule. The Rule sought to balance prayer with work, the communal life with solitude. The day was organized around the liturgy, with time for manual work and devotional reading. Fasts and work were apportioned according to the individual's strength. The hours for meals and the extent of one's fasting were settled by him alone, he might eat with the others in common or have bread and salt provided in his own cell every day or every second day. His rule was translated into Latin by [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon). Honoratus of Lérins followed the Rule of St. Pachomius. St. Basil and [St. Benedict](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) adapted and incorporated parts of it in their rules.

Pachomius continued as abbot to the cenobites for some thirty years. During an epidemic (probably plague), Pachomius called the monks, strengthened their faith, and failed to appoint his successor. Pachomius then died on May 9, 348 AD. By the time Pachomius died, eight monasteries and several hundred monks followed his guidance. Within a generation, cenobic practices spread from Egypt to Palestine and the Judean Desert, Syria, North Africa and eventually Western Europe. The number of monks may have reached 7000. His reputation as a holy man has endured. Among many miracles attributed to Pachomius, that though he had never learned the Greek or Latin tongues, he sometimes miraculously spoke them. Pachomius is also credited with being the first Christian to use and recommend use of a prayer rope.
