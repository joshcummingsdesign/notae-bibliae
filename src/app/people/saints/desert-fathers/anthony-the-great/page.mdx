Abbot

## First Part

[St. Antony](/glossary/names#anthony) was an Egyptian…born of noble parents, who had a sufficient property of their own; and as they were Christians, he too was Christianly brought up…When his parents took him into the Lord's house, he was not [defiant] as a boy, nor inattentive as he grew older; but was subject to his parents, and attentive to what was read, turning it to his own account. Nor, again, did he trouble his parents for various and expensive [luxuries]; but was content with what he found, and asked for nothing more.

When his parents died, he was left alone with a little sister—when he was about eighteen or twenty years of age—and he took care, both of his house and of her. But not six months after their death, as he was going as usual to the Lord's house, and collecting his thoughts, he meditated, as he walked, how the Apostles had left all and followed the Saviour; and how those in the Acts brought the price of what they had sold, and laid it at the Apostles' feet, to be given away to the poor; and what, and how great, a hope was laid up for them in heaven. With this in his mind he entered the church. And it befell then that the Gospel was being read; and he heard how the Lord had said to the rich man, "If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor; and come, follow me, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven." Antony, therefore, as if the remembrance of the saints had come to him from God, and as if the lesson had been read on his account, went forth at once from the Lord's house, and gave away to those of his own village the possessions he had inherited from his ancestors.

And having committed his sister to known and faithful virgins, and given to her wherewith to be educated in a nunnery, he himself thenceforth devoted himself, outside his house, to training; taking heed to himself, and [living an ascetic life]...And first he began to stay outside the village; and then, if he heard of any earnest man, he went to seek him, and did not return till he had seen him.

And from each of them he learnt some improvement in his earnestness and his training; he contemplated the courtesy of one, and another's [diligence] in prayer; another's freedom from anger; another's love of mankind; he took heed to one as he watched; to another as he studied; one he admired for his endurance, another for his fasting and sleeping on the ground; he laid to heart the meekness of one, and the long-suffering of another; and stamped upon his memory the devotion to Christ and the mutual love which all in common possessed. And thus filled full, he returned to his own place of training, gathering to himself what he had got from each, and striving to show all their qualities in himself…And all in the village who loved good, seeing him thus, called him the friend of God.

## Second Part

[St. Anthony] set off to the mountain...He endured [the attacks of the devil through faith, prayer and fasting] for twenty years, training himself alone; neither going forth, nor being seen by any one for long periods of time. But after this, when many longed for him, and wished to imitate his training, and others who knew him came [to him]…Antony came forth…And when they saw him they wondered; for his body had neither grown fat, nor waxed lean from fasting, but he was just such as they had known him before…Many sufferers in body, who were present, did the Lord heal by him. And he gave to Antony grace in speaking, so that he comforted many who grieved, and reconciled others who were at variance, exhorting all to prefer nothing in the world to the love of Christ, and persuading and exhorting them to be mindful of the good things to come, and of the love of God towards us, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all. He persuaded many to choose the solitary life; and so, thenceforth, cells sprang up in the mountains, and the desert was colonized by monks…and he governed them all as a father.

[At the end of his life,] he was visiting, according to his [custom], the monks in the outer mountain, and having learned from Providence concerning his own end, he said to the brethren, "This visit to you is my last, and I wonder if we shall see each other again in this life. It is time for me to set sail, for I am near a hundred and five years old." And when they heard that, they wept, and kissed the old man. And he, as if he were setting out from a foreign city to his own, spoke joyfully, and exhorted them not to grow idle in their labours, or cowardly in their training, but to live as those who died daily.

[Afraid that his body would be kept above ground—as was the custom of the Egyptians—and not buried as the Lord was,] he hurried himself and bade farewell to the monks in the outer mountain; and coming to the inner mountain, where he was [known] to abide, after a few months he grew sick, and calling those who were by—and there were two of them who had remained there within fifteen years, he said to them, "I indeed go the way of the fathers, as it is written, for I perceive that I am called by the Lord. Promise to bury me secretly, so that no one shall know the place, save you alone, for I shall receive my body incorruptible from my Saviour at the resurrection of the dead. And distribute my garments thus. To [Athanasius](/people/saints/greek-fathers/athanasius-of-alexandria), the bishop, give one of my sheepskins, and the cloak under me, which was new when he gave it me, and has grown old by me; and to Serapion, the bishop, give the other sheepskin; and [keep for yourselves] the hair-cloth garment. And for the rest, children, farewell, for Antony is going, and is with you no more."

Saying this, when they had embraced him, he stretched out his feet, and, as if he saw friends coming to him, [his face brightened with joy, and] he departed and was gathered to his fathers. And they forthwith, as he had commanded them, preparing the body and wrapping it up, hid it underground; and no one knows to this day where it is hidden, save those two servants only.[^1]
