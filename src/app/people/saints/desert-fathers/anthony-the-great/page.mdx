[St. Anthony the Great](/glossary/names#anthony) (251–356 AD) was born in Koma in Lower Egypt. When he was about 20 years old, his parents died and left him with the care of his unmarried sister. Shortly thereafter, the Holy Spirit led him to renounce his worldly riches according to Jesus' word, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me" (Matt. 19:21). Anthony gave away his land inheritance to his neighbors, sold the remaining property, and donated the funds to the poor. He then left to live an ascetic life, placing his sister with a group of Christian virgins.

For the next fifteen years, Anthony remained in the area. He ate only bread, salt and water and never meat or wine. He ate at most only once a day and sometimes fasted through two or four days. According to [St. Athanasius](/people/saints/greek-fathers/athanasius-of-alexandria), the devil fought Anthony by afflicting him with boredom, laziness, and the phantoms of women, which he overcame by the power of prayer. Soon after, he moved to one of the tombs near his native village.

Fifteen years later, at the age of thirty-five, Anthony determined to withdraw from the habitations of men and retire in absolute solitude. He went into the desert to a mountain by the Nile called Pispir (now Der-el-Memun). There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned Roman fort for some 20 years. Food was thrown to him over the wall. He was at times visited by pilgrims, whom he refused to see; but gradually a number of disciples established themselves in caves and in huts around the mountain. Thus, a colony of ascetics was formed, who begged Anthony to come forth and be their guide in the spiritual life. Eventually, he yielded to their importunities and, about the year 305, emerged from his retreat. To the surprise of all, he appeared to be not emaciated, but healthy in mind and body. For five or six years he devoted himself to the instruction and organization of the great body of monks that had grown up around him.

Soon after he withdrew into the inner desert that lay between the Nile and the Red Sea, near the shore of which he fixed his abode on a mountain (Mount Colzim) where still stands the monastery that bears his name, Der Mar Antonios. Here he spent the last forty-five years of his life, in a seclusion, not so strict as Pispir, for he freely saw those who came to visit him, and he used to cross the desert to Pispir with considerable frequency. Amid the Diocletian Persecutions in around 311, Anthony went to Alexandria and was conspicuous visiting those who were imprisoned.

Visitors traveled great distances to see the celebrated holy man. The fame of Anthony spread and reached Emperor Constantine, who wrote to him requesting his prayers. The brethren were pleased with the Emperor's letter, but Anthony was not overawed and wrote back exhorting the Emperor and his sons not to esteem this world but remember the next.

In 338, he left the desert temporarily to visit Alexandria to help refute the teachings of Arius. Around the year 342, an angel visited Anthony and told him, "There is a man who lives in the inner wilderness; the world is not worthy of his footsteps. By his prayers, the Lord brings rain and dew to fall on the Earth, and bring the flood of the Nile in its due season." When Anthony heard this, he rose right away and went to the inner wilderness, and God guided him to the cave of [St. Paul of Thebes](/people/saints/desert-fathers/paul-of-thebes).

When Anthony sensed his death approaching, he commanded his disciples to give his staff to his disciple Macarius of Egypt, and to give one sheepskin cloak to Athanasius of Alexandria and the other sheepskin cloak to another of his disciples, Serapion of Thmuis (Thumis was in Lower Egypt). He departed from this world in around 356 AD. Anthanasius recorded Anthony's life and his spiritual warfare in his book the *Life of Anthony*, written in Greek in around 360 AD. Anthony the Great is known as the "Father of Monasticism".
