<Initial text="John"/>

[St. John](/glossary/names#john) was a fisherman from Bethsaida (north of the Sea of Galilee). His father's name was Zebedee (Matt. 4:21), and his mother's name was Salome (Matt. 27:56) (Mark 15:40). He was the brother of [St. James](/people/saints/james), who together were called *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="boanerges" text="Boanerges" />*, Greek for "Sons of Thunder" (Mark 3:17). John is also referred to as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (John 13:23). He was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:2).

St. John was there with [St. Peter](/people/saints/peter) and St. James when Jesus healed Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:37-39). John, along with Peter and James, witnessed the Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-2).

Jesus tells John, "The one who is not against us is for us" (Mark 9:38-40). He and James ask Jesus to sit as his right and left hand in glory (Mark 10:35-38). He and James are rebuked for asking Jesus to bring wrath on those who rejected him in Samaria (Luke 9:54-55). He, along with St. Peter, St. James, and [St. Andrew](/people/saints/andrew) ask Jesus the signs of the end of the age on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3-4).

John and Peter are asked by Jesus to prepare the Passover (Luke 22:8), and John famously asks Jesus who is going to betray him (John 13:23-25).

When Jesus was crucified, he tells [St. Mary](/people/saints/mary), "Woman, behold, your son!" (John 19:26), referring to John.

After the Crucifixion, Peter and John were among the first to see the empty tomb (John 20:1-2). After [St. Mary Magdalene](/people/saints/mary-magdalene) saw the risen Jesus, she announced to the apostles, "I have seen the Lord" (John 20:18). Jesus then appeared to Peter (Luke 24:34) (1 Cor. 15:3-5), Cleopas and another on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18), and ten of the apostles—all but [St. Thomas](/people/saints/thomas) (John 20:19). Jesus appeared to all of the apostles, including Thomas, eight days later (John 20:26-27). Jesus then appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time (1 Cor. 15:6), and then once more to [St. James the Less](/people/saints/james-the-less) (1 Cor. 15:7). Before the Ascension, the disciples thought that John would not die because they misunderstood Jesus when he spoke of him (John 21:23).

John is the author of the [Gospel of John](/bible/new-testament/gospels/john), three of the [Epistles](/bible/new-testament/epistles): [1 John](/bible/new-testament/epistles/1-john), [2 John](/bible/new-testament/epistles/2-john), and [3 John](/bible/new-testament/epistles/3-john), and the [Book of Revelation](/bible/new-testament/revelation).
