<Initial text="John"/>

[St. John](/glossary/names#john) was a fisherman from Bethsaida (north of the Sea of Galilee). His father's name was Zebedee (Matt. 4:21), and his mother's name was Salome (Matt. 27:56) (Mark 15:40). He was the brother of [St. James](/people/saints/james), who together were called *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="boanerges" text="Boanerges" />*, Greek for "Sons of Thunder" (Mark 3:17). John is also referred to as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (John 13:23).

St. John was there with [St. Peter](/people/saints/peter) and St. James when Jesus healed Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:37-39). John, along with Peter and James, witnessed the Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-2).

Jesus tells John, "The one who is not against us is for us" (Mark 9:38-40). He and James ask Jesus to sit as his right and left hand in glory (Mark 10:35-38). He and James are rebuked for asking Jesus to bring wrath on those who rejected him in Samaria (Luke 9:54-55). He, along with St. Peter, St. James, and [St. Andrew](/people/saints/andrew) ask Jesus the signs of the end of the age on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3-4).

John and Peter are asked by Jesus to prepare the Passover (Luke 22:8), and John famously asks Jesus who is going to betray him (John 13:23-25).

When Jesus was crucified, he tells Mary, "Woman, behold, your son!" (John 19:26), referring to John. He and Peter are among the first to see the empty tomb (John 20:1-2). The disciples said he would not die because they misunderstood Jesus when he spoke of him (John 21:23). He is the author of the [Gospel of John](/bible/new-testament/gospels/john), three of the Epistles: [1 John](/bible/new-testament/epistles/1-john), [2 John](/bible/new-testament/epistles/2-john), and [3 John](/bible/new-testament/epistles/3-john), and the [Book of Revelation](/bible/new-testament/revelation).
