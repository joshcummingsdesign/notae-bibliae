<Initial text="Philip" />

[St. Philip](/glossary/names#philip) was a friend of [St. Peter](/people/saints/apostles/peter) and [St. Andrew](/people/saints/apostles/andrew) from Bethsaida (north of the Sea of Galilee) (John 1:44). He was also friends with [St. Bartholomew](/people/saints/apostles/bartholomew) who was from Cana (west of the Sea of Galilee) (John 1:45). Philip was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:3).

Philip was there when Jesus fed the five thousand (John 6:5-7). He and Andrew go to Jesus when some Greeks wish to see Jesus after his triumphal entry into Jerusalem (John 12:20-22). Philip is most known for asking Jesus, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us" (John 14:8).
