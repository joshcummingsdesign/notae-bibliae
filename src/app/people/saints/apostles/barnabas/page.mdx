[St. Barnabas](/glossary/names#barnabas), whose Hebrew name is [Joseph](/glossary/names#joseph), was a Levite from Cyprus (Acts 4:36) (Acts 14:14). He was the cousin of [St. Mark](/people/saints/evangelists/mark) (Col. 4:10). The church in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to Antioch when Hellenists from Cyprus and Cyrene were receiving the gospel there, and a great many people were added to the Lord (Acts 11:20-24). He then found [St. Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) in Tarsus and brought him to Antioch where they met with the church for a whole year and taught a great many people. There, the disciples were called Christians for the first time (Acts 11:25-26). Together with Paul, Barnabas brought a relief fund to Jerusalem during the famine (Acts 11:27-30). Paul and Barnabas went on the first mission through Asia Minor together (Acts 13:2). Paul and Barnabas are appointed to go to the Jerusalem Council to defend against the circumcision party (Acts 15:1-2). Eventually Paul and Barnabas parted ways over a disagreement about Mark, and Barnabas went to Cyprus while Paul went on his second missionary journey (Acts 15:37-41).
