<Initial text="Matthew" />

[St. Matthew](/glossary/names#matthew) was the brother of [St. James the Less](/people/saints/apostles/james-the-less), [St. Jude](/people/saints/apostles/jude) and [St. Simon](/people/saints/apostles/simon). James the Less, Jude, Matthew, and Simon were sons of [Cleopas](/glossary/names#cleopas), one of the men who encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas was married to [St. Joseph's](/people/saints/biblical/joseph-of-nazareth) sister Mary (John 19:25), which means that James the Less, Jude, Matthew, and Simon were Jesus' cousins (Matt. 9:9) (Mark 2:14) (Matt. 10:3) (Matt. 13:55).

Matthew's Hebrew name is [Levi](/glossary/names#levi), and he was a tax collector from Capernaum (north of the Sea of Galilee) (Matt. 9:9) (Mark 2:14). He was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:3). He is the author of the [Gospel of Matthew](/bible/new-testament/gospels/matthew).
