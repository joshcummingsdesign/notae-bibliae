<Initial text="Thomas" />

[St. Thomas](/glossary/names#thomas) was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:3).

When the disciples were worried Jesus would be stoned by the Jews (John 11:8), Thomas told them they should follow him even unto death (John 11:16). At the Passover, Thomas asked Jesus the way to the Father, to which Jesus responded that he is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:5-6).

After the Crucifixion, Peter and John were among the first to see the empty tomb (John 20:1-2). After [St. Mary Magdalene](/people/saints/biblical/mary-magdalene) saw the risen Jesus, she announced to the apostles, "I have seen the Lord" (John 20:18). Jesus then appeared to Peter (Luke 24:34) (1 Cor. 15:3-5), Cleopas and another on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18), and ten of the apostles—all but Thomas (John 20:19). Jesus appeared to all of the apostles, including Thomas, eight days later (John 20:26-27). Jesus had Thomas place his hands on his side (John 20:26-27), and Thomas said, "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28), to which Jesus replied, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed" (John 20:29).

Jesus then appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time (1 Cor. 15:6), and then once more to [St. James the Less](/people/saints/apostles/james-the-less) before the Ascension (1 Cor. 15:7).
