[St. Peter's](/glossary/names#peter) name is [Simon](/glossary/names#simon). He was a fisherman from Bethsaida (north of the Sea of Galilee). His brother [St. Andrew](/people/saints/apostles/andrew) was a disciple of [St. John the Baptist](/people/saints/biblical/john-the-baptist) who began to follow Jesus when he heard John say that he was the "Lamb of God" (John 1:40). Andrew told Simon that Jesus is the Messiah, and brought him to see Jesus. Jesus then renamed him Peter (John 1:41-42). Peter and Andrew's father's name is [Jonah](/glossary/names#jonah) (Matt. 16:17). Peter was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:2).

When Peter's mother-in-law was sick with a fever, Jesus healed her (Matt. 8:14-15). He was also there with [St. James](/people/saints/apostles/james) and [St. John](/people/saints/apostles/john) when Jesus heals Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:37-39). Peter was one of the disciples who witnessed Jesus walking on water, and is even called out to the water with him (Matt. 14:28-30).

Peter famously confessed Jesus as the Son of God, and was given the keys to the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 16:16-19). When Jesus foretold his resurrection, Peter doubted and was rebuked (Matt. 16:21-23). He, along with James and John, witnessed the Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-2), where Peter offered to make three tents for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah (Matt. 17:3-4). Peter, along with James, John and Andrew, asked Jesus the signs of the end of the age on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3-4).

Peter and John were asked by Jesus to prepare the Passover (Luke 22:8). When Jesus washed the disciples' feet, Peter questioned why (John 13:6-8).

At the Passover, Jesus foretold the Crucifixion, and Peter said he would never fall away (Matt. 26:31-33). Jesus then foretold that Peter would deny him three times (Matt. 26:33-34).

After the Crucifixion, Peter and John were among the first to see the empty tomb (John 20:1-2). After [St. Mary Magdalene](/people/saints/biblical/mary-magdalene) saw the risen Jesus, she announced to the apostles, "I have seen the Lord" (John 20:18). Jesus then appeared to Peter (Luke 24:34) (1 Cor. 15:3-5), Cleopas and another on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18), and ten of the apostles—all but [St. Thomas](/people/saints/apostles/thomas) (John 20:19). Jesus appeared to all of the apostles, including Thomas, eight days later (John 20:26-27). Jesus then appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time (1 Cor. 15:6), and then once more to [St. James the Less](/people/saints/apostles/james-the-less) (1 Cor. 15:7). Before the Ascension, Jesus called Peter to shepherd the disciples (John 21:16), and foretold his martyrdom (John 21:18-19). It was Peter who delivered the famous sermon at Pentecost (Acts 2:14).

Tradition holds that St. Peter and [St. Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) established a church in Rome.[^1] In around 62 AD, St. Peter wrote [1 Peter](/bible/new-testament/epistles/1-peter) from Rome.[^2] Just a few years later, Roman Emperor Nero blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome, and started a brutal wave of persecutions.[^3] Both Peter and Paul were imprisoned in Rome and sentenced to death. It was during this time that Peter wrote [2 Peter](/bible/new-testament/epistles/2-peter).[^4]

In around 68 AD, Peter and Paul were martyred at the Circus of Nero in Rome.[^5] Tradition holds that Peter was crucified upside down, unwilling to be crucified in the same manner as Christ.[^6]
