<Initial text="Mark"/>

[St. Mark](/glossary/names#mark), whose Hebrew name was [John](/glossary/names#john), was a disciple of Jesus from Cyrene (North Africa, modern day Libya), a writer, and a traveling companion of [St. Peter](/people/saints/peter) (1 Peter 5:13). He was the cousin of [St. Barnabas](/people/saints/barnabas) (Col. 4:10). He is also known as "Mark the Evangelist".

When Peter was set free from prison by the angel, he went to Mark's mother Mary's house (Acts 12:12). [St. Paul](/people/saints/paul) and St. Barnabas then brought him with them to Antioch (Acts 12:25). During Paul's first mission, Mark left him in Perga in Pamphylia (modern southwestern Turkey) (Acts 13:13). When Paul set off on his second mission, he did not want to take Mark because of this (Acts 15:37-38), however, the two were later reconciled (Phlm. 1:23-24) (2 Tim. 4:11).

Tradition holds that Mark established a church in Alexandria.[^1] He wrote the [Gospel of Mark](/bible/new-testament/gospels/mark).
