[St. James](/glossary/names#james) was a fisherman from Bethsaida (north of the Sea of Galilee). His father's name was Zebedee (Matt. 4:21), and his mother's name was Salome (Matt. 27:56) (Mark 15:40). He was the brother of [St. John](/people/saints/john), who together were called *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="boanerges" text="Boanerges" />*, Greek for "Sons of Thunder" (Mark 3:17).

St. James was there with [St. Peter](/people/saints/peter) and St. John when Jesus healed Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:37-39). He, along with Peter and John, witnessed the Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-2). He and John asked Jesus to sit as his right and left hand in glory (Mark 10:35-38). He and John were rebuked for asking Jesus to bring wrath on those who rejected him in Samaria (Luke 9:54-55) He, along with St. Peter, St. John and [St. Andrew](/people/saints/andrew), ask Jesus the signs of the end of the age on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3-4).

James was martyred by Herod Agrippa (Acts 12:1-2). [Legend](/meditations/st-james-and-the-scallop-shell) has it that he was buried at the hill of Libredón near Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain.
