<Initial text="Maximus the Confessor" />

Little is known about the early life of [St. Maximus](/glossary/names#maximus) <Definition lang="english" anchor="confessor" text="the Confessor" /> (580–662 AD). Some sources say that he was born in Palestine, but it is more likely that he was born in or around Constantinople due to his high level of education. Maximus was a civil servant, and an aide to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius. Eventually, Maximus left public life and took monastic vows at the monastery of Philippicus in Chrysopolis, a city across the Bosporus from Constantinople. Maximus was elevated to the position of abbot of the monastery. When the Persians conquered Asia Minor, Maximus was forced to flee to a monastery near Carthage (modern Tunisia in North Africa). It was there that he came under the tutelage of Sophronius (who later became patriarch of Jerusalem), and began studying in detail with him the Christological writings of [St. Gregory of Nazianzus](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/gregory-of-nazianzus) and Pseudo-Dionysius.

While Maximus was in Carthage, a controversy broke out regarding how to understand the interaction between the human and divine natures within the person of Jesus. This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, and were intensified following the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The <Definition lang="greek" anchor="monotheletes" text="Monothelites" /> adhered to the Chalcedonian definition of the hypostatic union: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will.

Maximus and the deposed Patriarch of Constantinople, Pyrrhus, held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism. In the debate, which was held in the presence of many North African bishops, Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will (Dyothelitism). The result of the debate was that Pyrrhus admitted the error of the Monothelite position, and Maximus accompanied him to Rome in 645 AD.

Maximus may have remained in Rome at San Saba, as he was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 AD at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may have been written by Maximus.

It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 AD under orders from Byzantine emperor Constans II, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.

Maximus' refusal to accept Monothelitism caused him to be brought to the imperial capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658 AD. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander. In 662, Maximus was placed on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so he could no longer speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters.

Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern Georgia and was cast in the fortress of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri. He died soon thereafter, on August 13, 662 AD.

Along with Pope Martin I, Maximus was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople (the Sixth Ecumenical Council, 680–681 AD), which declared that Christ possessed both a human and a divine will. With this declaration Monothelitism became heresy, and Maximus was posthumously declared innocent.

Maximus is among those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus' theological position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb. Maximus is one of the last men to be recognized by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church.
