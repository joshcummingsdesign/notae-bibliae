<Initial text="Irenaeus of Lyon"/>

[St. Irenaeus of Lyon](/glossary/names#irenaeus) (130–202 AD) grew up in [St. Polycarp's](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers/polycarp-of-smyrna) hometown of Smyrna (western Asia Minor), and was raised in a Christian family. Tradition holds that Irenaeus was a student of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John the Apostle. Irenaeus was a priest of the Church of Lyon during the persecution of Christians by Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius beginning in 161. In 177, he was sent to Rome with a letter to Pope Eleutherius concerning the heresy of Montanism, and that occasion bore emphatic testimony to his merits. While Irenaeus was in Rome, a persecution took place in Lyon. Returning to Gaul, Irenaeus succeeded the martyr Pothinus as the second Bishop of Lyon. During the religious peace which followed the persecution by Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary.

Irenaeus wrote a number of books, his most famous being *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="adversus-haereses" text="Adversus Haereses" />*, which was written as a defense against Gnosticism. To counter the doctrines of the Gnostic sects claiming secret wisdom, he offered three pillars of orthodoxy: the scriptures, the tradition handed down from the apostles, and the teaching of the apostles' successors. Irenaeus also asserted that all four of the Gospels were canonical scripture, making him the earliest surviving witness to regard all four of the now-canonical gospels as essential. Irenaeus is also the earliest attestation that the Gospel of John was written by John the Apostle, and that the Gospel of Luke was written by Luke, the companion of Paul. He also considered all 13 letters belonging to the Pauline corpus to have been written by Paul himself. In his writings, Irenaeus quoted from over 20 of the 27 New Testament books.

In around 190, Irenaeus exerted influence on Pope Victor I not to excommunicate the Christian communities of Asia Minor which persevered in the practice of the Quartodeciman celebration of Easter.

Irenaeus is regarded as a martyr, and Pope Francis declared him a Doctor of the Church in 2022.

> "For it was not merely for those who believed on him in the time of Tiberius Caesar that Christ came, nor did the Father exercise his providence for the men only who are now alive, but for all men altogether, who from the beginning, according to their capacity, in their generation have both feared and loved God, and practiced justice and piety towards their neighbors, and have earnestly desired to see Christ, and to hear his voice."
