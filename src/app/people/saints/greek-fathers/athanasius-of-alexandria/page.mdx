<Initial text="Athanasius of Alexandria"/>

[St. Athanasius of Alexandria](/glossary/names#athanasius) (293–373 AD) was born to a Christian family in Alexandria. He received a formal education, and was fluent in Greek and Coptic. When Athanasius was a child, Alexander of Alexandria, who would later become Pope of Alexandria, stood by a window and saw Athanasius and his friends playing and reenacting the sacrament of Baptism. Alexander sent for the children and discovered that Athanasius had acted as bishop in the reenactment. After questioning Athanasius, Alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine, as both the form and matter of the Sacrament had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water, and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly catechized. He invited Athanasius and his playfellows to prepare for clerical careers.

Peter of Alexandria, the 17th Pope of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of the Diocletian Persecutions and may have been one of Athanasius' teachers. Alexander became Peter's successor. In 312, Roman emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, and in 313 he issued the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire. Seeing Athanasius' wisdom even at his young age, Alexander invited Athanasius to be his assistant.

Athanasius' earliest work, *Against the Heathen — On the Incarnation* (written before 319), bears traces of [Origenist](/people/scholars/origen) Alexandrian thought. Athanasius was familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools and in particular with the developments of neoplatonism. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the Catechetical School of Alexandria away from Origenist principles such as subordinationism, universal salvation, and the allegorical interpretation of Scripture.

Alexander ordained Athanasius a deacon in 319. During this time, he became acquainted with the [Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers), in particular [St. Anthony](/people/saints/desert-fathers/anthony-the-great), about whom he wrote a biography. It was also during this time that a presbyter named Arius came into a direct conflict with Alexander. Arius taught that the Father and the Son were not one in essence, but that the Son was a created being. This is problematic for the doctrine of salvation because if Christ was not God, he could not save us.

In 325, Athanasius attended the First Council of Nicaea where he opposed Arius and became the champion of the Nicene Creed. Already a recognized theologian and ascetic, he was the obvious choice to replace his aging mentor Alexander as the Pope of Alexandria. After the death of Alexander, which occurred five months after the termination of the Council of Nicaea, Athanasius was unanimously elected to fill the vacant see. Athanasius resisted accepting the position because of the volatile and dangerous political climate of the time. The clergy and people were determined to have him as their bishop, and he ultimately consented and was consecrated in 326.

During his time as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of Egypt and Libya. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including [St. Pachomius](/people/saints/desert-fathers/pachomius-the-great), which proved very valuable to him over the years. Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life. During the forty-eight years of his episcopate, his history is told in the history of the controversies in which he was constantly engaged with the Arians, and of the sufferings he had to endure in defense of the Nicene faith.

On May 2, 373, having consecrated Peter II, one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters. Athanasius is considered a Doctor of the Church, and is sometimes called the Father of Orthodoxy. About him, [St. Gregory of Nazianzus](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/gregory-of-nazianzus) said, "When I praise Athanasius, virtue itself is my theme, for I name every virtue as often as I mention him who was possessed of all virtues. He was the true pillar of the Church. His life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith."
