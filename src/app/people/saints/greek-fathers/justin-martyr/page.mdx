<Initial text="Justin Martyr" />

[St. Justin Martyr](/glossary/names#justin) (100–165 AD) was born into a Greek family at Flavia Neapolis (today Nablus) near the ancient biblical city of Shechem, in Samaria. He knew little or no Hebrew and Aramaic, and had only a passing acquaintance with Judaism. His family may have been pagan, since he was uncircumcised, and defined himself as a Gentile. His grandfather, Bacchius, had a Greek name, while his father, Priscus, bore a Latin name, which has led to speculations that his ancestors may have settled in Neapolis soon after its establishment or that they were descended from a Roman diplomatic community that had been sent there.

Justin describes his early education, stating that his initial studies left him unsatisfied due to their failure to provide a belief system that would afford theological and metaphysical inspiration to their young pupil. He says he tried first the school of a Stoic philosopher, who was unable to explain God's being to him. He then attended a Peripatetic (Aristotelian) philosopher, but was put off because the philosopher was too eager for his fee. Then he went to hear a Pythagorean philosopher who demanded that he first learn music, astronomy, and geometry, which he did not wish to do. Subsequently, he adopted Platonism after encountering a Platonist thinker who had recently settled in his city. Some time afterwards, he met an old man, possibly a Syrian Christian, in the vicinity of the seashore, who engaged him in a dialogue about God and spoke of the testimony of the prophets as being more reliable than the reasoning of philosophers.

Moved by the aged man's argument, Justin renounced both his former religious faith and his philosophical background, choosing instead to re-dedicate his life to the service of God. His newfound convictions were only bolstered by the ascetic lives of the early Christians and the heroic example of the martyrs, whose piety convinced him of the moral and spiritual superiority of Christian doctrine. As a result, he thenceforth decided that the only option for him was to travel throughout the land, spreading the knowledge of Christianity as the "true philosophy." His conversion is commonly assumed to have taken place at Ephesus, though it may have occurred anywhere on the road from Syria Palestina to Rome.

He then adopted the dress of a philosopher himself and traveled about teaching. During the reign of Roman emperor Antoninus Pius, he arrived in Rome and started his own school. Tatian was one of his pupils. Most of his works are lost, but two apologies and a dialogue did survive. *The First Apology*, his most well-known text, passionately defends the morality of the Christian life, and provides various ethical and philosophical arguments to convince Antoninus to abandon the persecution of the Church. He also indicated, as [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) would later, the notion of a "true religion" that predated Christianity, that the "seeds of Christianity" (manifestations of the Logos acting in history) actually predated Christ's Incarnation. Thus, he claimed that many historical Greek philosophers (including Socrates and Plato), in whose works he was well studied, were unknowing Christians.

During the reign of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, after disputing with the cynic philosopher Crescens, he was denounced by the latter to the authorities, according to Tatian and [Eusebius](/people/scholars/eusebius). Justin was tried, together with six friends (two of them slaves educated by him; Euelpistus and Hierax), by the urban prefect Junius Rusticus, and was beheaded.

In 1882, Pope Leo XIII had a Mass and an Office composed for his feast day, which he set at April 14, one day after the date of his death, but since this date quite often falls within the main Paschal celebrations, the feast was moved in 1968 to June 1, the date on which he has been celebrated in the Byzantine Rite since at least the 9th century.
