<Initial text="Cyril of Jerusalem" />

[St. Cyril of Jerusalem](/glossary/names#cyril) (313–386 AD) was born at or near the city of Jerusalem and was well-read in both the writings of the early Christian theologians and the Greek philosophers. He was ordained a deacon by Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem in about 335 AD, and a priest some eight years later by Bishop Maximus. Around the end of 350 AD, he succeeded Maximus in the See of Jerusalem. [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) suggested Cyril was an Arian at this stage, however, Cyril never mentioned Arianism explicitly, but rather avoided using the word ὁμοούσιος (homooúsios, "of one essence" or "consubstantial") during this time.

Relations between Arian Bishop of Caesarea, Acacius, became strained due to jealousy of the importance assigned to Cyril's See by the Council of Nicaea, as well as by the threat posed to Caesarea by the rising influence of the seat of Jerusalem as it developed into the prime Christian holy place and became a centre of pilgrimage. The city of Jerusalem had suffered drastic food shortages at which point Cyril secretly sold sacramental ornaments of the church and a valuable holy robe, fashioned with gold thread that the emperor Constantine had once donated for the bishop to wear when he performed the rite of Baptism, possibly to keep people from starving. Acacius charged Cyril with selling church property, and a church council held under Acacius' influence in 357 AD deposed Cyril in his absence. Cyril took refuge with Silvanus, Bishop of Tarsus, and in 359 AD, the Council of Seleucia reinstated Cyril and deposed Acacius. In 360 AD, this was reversed by Emperor Constantius again, and Cyril suffered another year in exile from Jerusalem until Emperor Julian allowed him to return in 361 AD. Cyril was once again banished from Jerusalem by the Arian Emperor Valens in 367 AD, but was able to return again after Valens' death in 378 AD.

Around 380 AD, [St. Gregory of Nyssa](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/gregory-of-nyssa) traveled to Jerusalem where Cyril faced opposition from local clergy who accused him of Arianism. Gregory's attempted mediation of the dispute was unsuccessful. Cyril's jurisdiction over Jerusalem was expressly confirmed by the First Council of Constantinople (381 AD), at which he was present. At that council Cyril voted for the acceptance of the term *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="homoousios" text="homoousios" />*, having been finally convinced it was the proper term to describe the relationship between the Father and the Son.

Cyril's writings beautifully demonstrate the orthodoxy of his faith. Cyril took the ordinary ground of the [Greek Fathers](/people/saints/greek-fathers) in that there is freedom of the will, and that sin is the consequence of this freedom. Cyril's writings are filled with the loving and forgiving nature of God, which was somewhat uncommon during his time period. Cyril filled his writings with great lines of the healing power of forgiveness and the Holy Spirit.

> "The Spirit comes gently and makes himself known by his fragrance. He is not felt as a burden for God is light, very light. Rays of light and knowledge stream before him as the Spirit approaches. The Spirit comes with the tenderness of a true friend to save, to heal, to teach, to counsel, to strengthen and to console."

Cyril himself followed God's message of forgiveness many times throughout his life. This is most clearly seen in his two major exiles where Cyril was disgraced and forced to leave his position and his people behind. He never wrote or showed any ill will towards those who wronged him. Cyril stressed the themes of healing and regeneration in his catechesis.

Cyril's famous twenty-three lectures given to catechumens in Jerusalem are best considered in two parts. The first eighteen lectures are commonly known as the *Catechetical Lectures*, while the final five are often called the *Mystagogic Catecheses* because they deal with the mysteries, i.e. sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist.

Cyril's writings left an indelible mark on future generations of Christians, and in 1883 he was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Leo XIII.
