<Initial text="John Chrysostom"/>

[St. John Chrysostom](/glossary/names#chrysostom) (347–407 AD) was born in Antioch (modern Antakya, Hatay, Turkey). His father was a high-ranking military officer. John's father died soon after his birth and he was raised by his mother Anthusa. He was baptised in his twenties, and tonsured as a reader (one of the minor orders of the Church).

As a result of his mother's influential connections in the city, John began his education under the pagan preacher Libanius. From Libanius, John acquired the skills for a career in rhetoric, as well as a love of the Greek language and literature. Eventually, he became a lawyer. As he grew older, however, John became more deeply committed to Christianity and went on to study theology under Diodore of Tarsus, founder of the re-constituted School of Antioch. According to the Christian historian Sozomen, Libanius was supposed to have said on his deathbed that John would have been his successor "if the Christians had not taken him from us."

John lived in extreme asceticism and became a hermit in about 375; he spent the next two years continually standing, scarcely sleeping, and committing the Bible to memory. As a consequence of these practices, his stomach and kidneys were permanently damaged and poor health forced him to return to Antioch.

In 381, John was ordained as a deacon by the bishop Meletius of Antioch, who was not then in communion with Alexandria and Rome. Despite Meletius' personal leanings toward Nicene orthodoxy, he had been appointed by Arian sympathizers, which caused a rival bishop Paulinus and his followers to refuse to acknowledge him because of his initial association with Arians. After the death of Meletius, John separated himself from the followers of Meletius without joining Paulinus. After the death of Paulinus in 388, John was ordained a presbyter by Paulinus' successor Evagrius of Antioch.

As a presbyter, John used his diplomatic skills to mediate between the leaders of Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome. His efforts helped lead them to come back into full communion. This was no small feat, as the schism had lasted nearly seventy years and was deeply rooted in theological and political tensions.

In Antioch, over the course of twelve years (386–397), John gained popularity because of the eloquence of his public speaking at the Golden Church, Antioch's cathedral, especially his insightful expositions of Bible passages and moral teaching. The most valuable of his works from this period are his homilies on various books of the Bible. He emphasised charitable giving and was concerned with the spiritual and temporal needs of the poor. He spoke against abuse of wealth and personal property.

> "Do you wish to honor the body of Christ? Do not ignore him when he is naked. Do not pay him homage in the temple clad in silk, only then to neglect him outside where he is cold and ill-clad. He who said, 'This is my body' is the same who said, 'You saw me hungry and you gave me no food', and 'Whatever you did to the least of my brothers you did also to me'…What good is it if the Eucharistic table is overloaded with golden chalices when your brother is dying of hunger? Start by satisfying his hunger and then with what is left you may adorn the altar as well."

His straightforward understanding of the Scriptures—in contrast to the Alexandrian tendency towards allegorical interpretation—meant that the themes of his talks were practical, explaining the Bible's application to everyday life. Such straightforward preaching helped Chrysostom to garner popular support.

In 387 AD, the people of Antioch were suffering from high taxes and economic hardship. These taxes were imposed by Emperor Theodosius I to fund military campaigns and consolidate his rule. The population, frustrated by the heavy financial burden, expressed their anger through a violent uprising. During this uprising, a mob in Antioch vandalized public property and, most notably, mutilated statues of Emperor Theodosius I, his deceased wife Flaccilla, and other members of the imperial family. In the Roman Empire, the emperor's statues were symbols of imperial authority, and damaging them was considered a serious offense—tantamount to an attack on the emperor himself. Flavian, the bishop of Antioch, personally traveled to the capital to appeal to Emperor Theodosius for mercy. His goal was to prevent the emperor from taking drastic retribution against Antioch. Chrysostom supported Flavian's efforts by delivering a series of powerful homilies, known as the "Homilies on the Statues," in which he urged the citizens to repent for their actions, pray for forgiveness, and rely on God's mercy. These made a lasting impression on the general population of the city. Many pagans converted to Christianity as a result of the homilies, and the city was ultimately spared from severe consequences.

In the autumn of 397, John Chrysostom was appointed as the archbishop of Constantinople. His appointment was unusual in that it was orchestrated largely by Eutropius, a powerful eunuch and court official who served under Emperor Arcadius. John himself was not involved in the process of his nomination and was, in fact, unaware of it until later. The authorities feared that openly announcing his departure might trigger civil unrest or protests from the people of Antioch, who did not want to lose such a beloved figure. To avoid this potential upheaval, John was taken from Antioch in secret and transported to Constantinople.

During his time as archbishop he adamantly refused to host lavish social gatherings, which made him popular with the common people, but unpopular with wealthy citizens and the clergy. His reforms of the clergy were also unpopular. He told visiting regional preachers to renounce their pay and return to the churches they were meant to be serving. Also he founded a number of hospitals in Constantinople.

His time in Constantinople was more tumultuous than his time in Antioch. Theophilus, the patriarch of Alexandria, wanted to bring Constantinople under his sway and opposed John's appointment to Constantinople. Theophilus had disciplined the Tall Brothers (four monks from Nitria—northeastern Egypt—so named because of their tall stature) over their support of Origen's teachings. They fled to John and were welcomed by him. Theophilus therefore accused John of being too partial to the teaching of Origen. He made another enemy in Aelia Eudoxia, wife of emperor Arcadius, who assumed that John's denunciations of extravagance in feminine dress were aimed at her. Eudoxia, Theophilus, and other of his enemies held a synod in 403 (the Synod of the Oak) to charge John, in which his connection to Origen was used against him. It resulted in his deposition and banishment. He was called back by Arcadius almost immediately, as the people became outraged over his departure, even threatening to burn the imperial palace. There was an earthquake the night of his arrest, which Eudoxia took for a sign of God's anger, prompting her to ask Arcadius for John's reinstatement.

Peace was short-lived. A silver statue of Eudoxia was erected in the Augustaion (an important square in Constantinople) near the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="hagia-sophia" text="Hagia Sophia" />. John denounced the dedication ceremonies as pagan and spoke against the empress in harsh terms, "Again Herodias raves, again she dances, and again desires to receive John's head on a charger", an allusion to the events surrounding the death of John the Baptist. Once again he was banished. His banishment sparked riots among his supporters in the capital, and in the fighting the Hagia Sophia was burnt down, necessitating its reconstruction under Theodosius II. While in exile, John began to lend moral and financial support to Christian monks who were enforcing the emperors' anti-pagan laws, by destroying temples and shrines in Phoenicia and nearby regions.

While in exile, John wrote an appeal for help to three churchmen: Pope Innocent I; Venerius, the bishop of Mediolanum (modern Milan, Italy); and Chromatius, the bishop of Aquileia (an ancient Roman city in Italy). Pope Innocent I protested John's banishment from Constantinople, but to no avail. Innocent sent a delegation to intercede on behalf of John in 405 led by Gaudentius of Brescia. Gaudentius and his companions, two bishops, encountered many difficulties and never reached their goal of entering Constantinople. John wrote letters which still held great influence in Constantinople. As a result of this, he was further exiled from Cucusus (modern Göksun, Turkey—where he stayed from 404 to 407) to Pitiunt (in modern Georgia).

John never reached Pitiunt alive, as he died during the journey at Comana Pontica (modern Gümenek, Tokat, Turkey) on September 14, 407. He died in the Presbyterium or community of the clergy belonging to the church of Saint Basiliscus of Comana. His last words are said to have been "Glory be to God for all things."

John Chrysostom was venerated as a saint soon after his death, and in 1908 he was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius X. Some 700 sermons and 246 letters by John Chrysostom survive, plus biblical commentaries, moral discourses, and theological treatises. Because the date of his death, September 14, is occupied by the feast of the Feast of the Cross, the Western Church celebrates him on the previous day, September 13.
