<Initial text="John of Damascus" />

[St. John of Damascus](/glossary/names#john) (675–749 AD) was born in Damascus to a prominent Damascene Christian Arab family. His father served as an official for the Umayyad Caliphate, while his grandfather held significant roles under both Byzantine and early Muslim rule. John left Damascus in around 705 AD, and eventually became a monk at Mar Saba, a monastery overlooking the Kidron Valley, southeast of Jerusalem. He was ordained a priest in 735 AD.

John was a polymath whose fields of interest and contribution included law, theology, philosophy, and music. He was given the name *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="khrusorrhoas" text="Chrysorroas" />*, a reference to his "golden voice". He wrote works expounding the Christian faith, and composed hymns which are still used to this day.

In the early 8th century, iconoclasm, a movement opposed to the veneration of icons, gained acceptance in the Byzantine court. In 726 AD, despite the protests of Germanus, Patriarch of Constantinople, Emperor Leo III issued his first edict against the veneration of images and their exhibition in public places. John undertook a spirited defense of holy images in three separate publications. The earliest of these works, his *Apologetic Treatises Against Those Decrying the Holy Images*, secured his reputation. In it, he not only argued against the Byzantine emperor, but employed a simple style that allowed the controversy to be followed by the common people, stirring rebellion among the iconoclasts. Decades after his death, John's writings would play an important role during the Second Council of Nicaea (787 AD), which convened to settle the icon dispute.

Leo III reportedly sent forged documents to the Muslim officials which implicated John in a plot to attack Damascus. The officials then ordered John's right hand be cut off and hung up in public view. Some days afterwards, John asked for the restitution of his hand, and prayed fervently to the *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="theotokos" text="Theotokos" />* before her icon. Thereupon, his hand is said to have been miraculously restored. In gratitude for this miraculous healing, he attached a silver hand to the icon, which thereafter became known as the *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="tricherousa" text="Tricherousa" />*. That icon is now located in the Hilandar monastery, one of the twenty Eastern Orthodox monasteries in Mount Athos in Greece.

Due to his commitment to iconodulism, he was condemned by anathema by the iconoclastic Council of Hieria (a suburb of Constantinople) in 754 AD. Decades after his death, John's writings would play an important role during the Second Council of Nicaea (787 AD), which convened to settle the icon dispute.

Aside from his defense of the veneration of icons, John was also a prominent exponent of *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="perichoresis" text="perichoresis" />*, a term used to describe the two natures of Christ, which he expanded to describe the relationship between the persons of the Trinity.

John is known as the "last of the [Greek Fathers](/people/saints/greek-fathers)", and in 1890, he was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Leo XIII.
