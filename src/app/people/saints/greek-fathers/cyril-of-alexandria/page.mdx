<Initial text="Cyril of Alexandria"/>

[St. Cyril of Alexandria](/glossary/names#cyril) (376–444 AD) was born in the town of Didouseya, Egypt (modern El-Mahalla El-Kubra, north Egypt, east of Alexandria). A few years after his birth, his maternal uncle Theophilus rose to the powerful position of Patriarch of Alexandria. His mother remained close to her brother and under his guidance, Cyril was well educated. His writings show his knowledge of Christian writers of his day, such as [Eusebius](/people/scholars/eusebius), [Origen](/people/scholars/origen), and Didymus the Blind (student of Origen).

In 402 AD, Theophilus was summoned by the emperor to Constantinople to apologize before a synod, over which [St. John Chrysostom](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-chrysostom) would preside, on account of several charges which were brought against him by Egyptian monks, including the Tall Brothers (four monks from Nitria—northeastern Egypt—so named because of their tall stature), whom Theophilus had persecuted as Origenists. Theophilus rallied support against Chrysostom and drafted a long list of largely unfounded accusations against him. In 403 AD, Cyril attended the Synod of the Oak with his uncle Theophilus, during which Chrysostom was deposed.

Theophilus died in 412 AD, and Cyril was made Patriarch of Alexandria. This was a time of turmoil and violent conflict between the city's pagan, Jewish, and Christian inhabitants, and Cyril's tenure was marked by a period of significant controversy. Despite this, however, Cyril was a staunch defender the Nicene faith, and early in his reign, he closed the churches of the Novatianists.

In 428 AD, Nestorius was made Archbishop of Constantinople, and began teaching that Christ had two distinct natures (human and divine) and therefore could not suffer. He also taught that Mary only gave birth to Christ's human nature, and therefore could not be properly called *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="theotokos" text="Theotokos" />*. Cyril vehemently rejected this claim, and this ultimately led to the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD. John of Antioch had not yet arrived at the council, and Cyril, taking offense to this, convoked the council before he had arrived. Because of this, Nestorius refused to attend. When John arrived, he and Nestorius convened their own council. Predictably, each council condemned the other for heresy. Ultimately, the Church sided with Cyril, and in 433 AD, Cyril made amends with John of Antioch in his famous letter which came to be known as "The Formula of Reunion".

Cyril was a scholarly archbishop and a prolific writer. In the early years of his active life in the Church he wrote several exegetical documents. Among these were: *Commentaries on the Old Testament*, *Thesaurus*, *Discourse Against Arians*, *Commentary on St. John's Gospel*, and *Dialogues on the Trinity*. In 429 AD as the Christological controversies increased, the output of his writings was so extensive that his opponents could not match it. His writings and his theology have remained central to the tradition of the Fathers and to all Orthodox to this day.
