[St. Christopher of Lycia](/glossary/names#christopher) (d. 251 AD) was initially called Reprobus (Latin: "Reprobated"). He was a Canaanite who was extremely tall and was said to have a fearsome face. While serving the king of Canaan, he took it into his head to go and serve "the greatest king there was". He went to the king who was reputed to be the greatest, but one day he saw the king cross himself at the mention of the devil. Learning that the king feared the devil, he departed to look for the him instead. On his way, he came across a band of marauders, one of whom declared himself to be the devil, and Christopher decided to serve him. But when he saw his new master avoid a wayside cross and found out that the devil feared Christ, he left him and set out to find Christ.

On his journey, Christopher met a hermit who instructed him in the Christian faith. Christopher asked him how he could serve Christ. Christopher did not want a life of solitude, so the hermit suggested he could serve Christ by assisting people to cross a dangerous river, in which many people were perishing in the attempt. Christopher agreed and set off to perform his duty.

After Christopher had performed this service for some time, a little child asked him to take him across the river. During the crossing, the river rose and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, he said to the child, "You have put me in the greatest danger. I do not think the whole world could have been as heavy on my shoulders as you were." The child replied, "You had on your shoulders not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work." The child then vanished.

Christopher later went on a mission to Lycia (southwestern Asia Minor) where he converted many and comforted those who were being persecuted for their Christian faith. He was brought before the king, who commanded him to sacrifice to the pagan gods. When Christopher refused, the king tried to win him over with riches. When Christopher still refused, the king sent two beautiful women to tempt him. Christopher spoke to the women about Christ, and converted them to Christianity. It was then that the king ordered him to be killed. Various attempts failed, but finally Christopher was arrested and beheaded.
