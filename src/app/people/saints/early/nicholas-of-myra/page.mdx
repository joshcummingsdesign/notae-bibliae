<Initial text="Nicholas of Myra"/>

[St. Nicholas of Myra](/glossary/names#nicholas) (270–343 AD) was born in the Anatolian seaport of Patara, Lycia (modern southwest Turkey) to wealthy Christian parents. After his parents died from an epidemic, Nicholas is said to have distributed their wealth to the poor. Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as "Nicholas the Wonderworker".

In one of the earliest attested and most famous incidents from his life, he is said to have rescued three girls from being forced into prostitution by dropping a sack of gold coins through the window of their house each night for three nights so their father could pay a dowry for each of them.

In his youth, he is said to have made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. On his way, the ship he was on was nearly destroyed by a terrible storm, but he rebuked the waves, causing the storm to subside. When he arrived, he lived in a crypt near Bethlehem, where the Nativity of Jesus is believed to have taken place.

After visiting the Holy Land, Nicholas returned to Myra. The Bishop of Myra had recently died, and the priests in the city had decided that the first priest to enter the church that morning would be made bishop. Nicholas went to the church to pray and was therefore proclaimed the new bishop.

Another early story about Nicholas tells of him saving three innocent men from execution. The men were condemned by Governor Eustathius, but as they were about to be executed, Nicholas intervened, stopping the executioner's sword, freeing the men, and reprimanding a juror who had accepted a bribe.

Nicholas is said to have been imprisoned and tortured during the Great Persecution under the Emperor Diocletian, but was released under the orders of the Emperor Constantine.

Nicholas is listed as an attendee at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, where he is said to have been a staunch opponent of Arianism and a devoted supporter of Trinitarianism, and one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed.

Fewer than 200 years after Nicholas' death, the St. Nicholas Church was built in Myra under the orders of Theodosius II over the site of the church where he had served as bishop, and his remains were moved to a sarcophagus in that church. In 1087, while the Greek Christian inhabitants of the region were subjugated by the newly arrived Muslim Seljuk Turks, and soon after the beginning of the East–West schism, a group of merchants from the Italian city of Bari removed the major bones of Nicholas' skeleton from his sarcophagus in the church without authorization and brought them to their hometown, where they are now enshrined in the Basilica di San Nicola.

There are many Dutch traditions regarding Nicholas' secret gift giving. The Dutch name for Saint Nicholas is *Sint Nikolass*, which was shortened to *Sinterklaas*. When the Dutch established the colony of New Amsterdam, they brought the legend and traditions of Sinterklaas with them. Thus, the tradition of "Santa Claus" exists in America to this day.

Nicholas of Myra is commemorated on December 6th, the traditional date of his death.
