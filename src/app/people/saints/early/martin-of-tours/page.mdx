<Initial text="Martin of Tours" />

[St. Martin of Tours](/glossary/names#martin) (316–397 AD) was born in Savaria (modern Szombathely, western Hungary). His father was a tribune in the Roman military, and was given land on which to retire Ticinum (modern Pavia, northern Italy), where Martin grew up. Christianity had been made legal in 313 AD by the Edict of Milan. At the age of 10, Martin attended a Christian church against the wishes of his parents and became a catechumen.

At the age of 15, Martin was required to join the cavalry, and at 18, he was stationed in Gaul (modern France). One day as he was approaching the gates of the city of Amiens (just north of Paris), he met a beggar. He impulsively cut his military cloak in half to share with the man. That night, Martin dreamed of Jesus wearing the half of the cloak he had given away. He heard Jesus say to some of the angels, "Martin, who is still but a catechumen, clothed me with this robe." The dream confirmed Martin in his piety, and he was soon after baptized.

Just before a battle in the Gallic provinces at Borbetomagus (modern Worms, Germany), Martin switched allegiance to a new commanding officer—Jesus Christ—and refused to fight. He was charged with cowardice and jailed, but in response to the charge, he volunteered to go unarmed to the front of the troops. His superiors planned to take him up on the offer, but before they could, the invaders sought peace, the battle never occurred, and Martin was released from military service.

Martin declared his vocation, and made his way to the city of Caesarodunum (modern Tours in the province of Touraine, France), where he became a disciple of [St. Hilary of Poitiers](/people/saints/latin-fathers/hilary-of-poitiers). When Hilary was forced into exile, Martin returned to Italy. On the way, he converted a robber; and one account even depicts Martin confronting the devil himself before arriving in Milan. Martin was called in a dream to visit his homeland, so he crossed the Alps and went to Pannonia (modern western Hungary). There he converted many, including his own mother. His father, however, he could not win over.

In Illyricum (near modern Croatia) Martin opposed the Arians with so much zeal that he was publicly whipped and forced to leave. In Illyria (near modern Albania), Arian Archbishop of Milan, Auxentius of Milan, expelled him from the city. Martin sought refuge on Gallinara Island off the coast of northern Italy—living the solitary life of a hermit, surviving on a diet of herbs and wild roots, and being visited for a time by St. Hilary.

In 361, Martin joined St. Hilary to Poitiers (west-central France) and established a monastery at what is now the town of Ligugé. He soon attracted many converts and followers. The monastery later developed into Ligugé Abbey, one of the oldest monasteries in western Europe belonging to the Order of [St. Benedict](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia).

In 371, Martin was asked to come to Tours minister to someone who was sick, and was vehemently urged by the locals to succeed Litorius as the third bishop of Tours. He was so unwilling that he hid in a barn full of geese, but their cackling gave him away to the crowd. He reluctantly accepted and was consecrated soon after.

As bishop, Martin ordered the destruction of pagan temples, altars and sculptures. In one instance, pagans agreed to fell their sacred pine tree, if Martin would stand directly in its path. He did so, and it miraculously missed him.

Marin withdrew from the city to live in Marmoutier, a rural monastery which he founded a short distance upstream from Tours on the opposite shore of the river Loire. Martin introduced a rudimentary parish system in his diocese. Once a year, he visited each of his parishes, traveling on foot, or by donkey or boat. He continued to set up monastic communities, and extended the influence of his episcopate from Touraine to such distant points as Chartres, Paris, Autun, and Vienne.

In the late 4th century, the Priscillianists (an offshoot of Gnosticism) were being persecuted in Gaul and Spain. Although Martin opposed their teachings, he, along with [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan), objected to executing heretics and imperial interference in church matters. Despite Martin's pleas, Emperor Maximus ultimately had Priscillian and his followers executed in 385, leaving Martin deeply grieved.

Martin died in Candes-Saint-Martin, Gaul (central France) in 397. After he died, local citizens of the Poitou region and residents of Tours quarreled over where Martin would be buried. One evening after dark, several residents of Tours carried Martin's body to a waiting boat on the river Loire, where teams of rowers ferried his body on the river to Tours, where a huge throng of people waited on the river banks to meet and pay their last respects to Martin's body. One chronicle states that 2,000 monks, and nearly as many white-robed virgins, walked in the procession accompanying the body from the river to a small grove just west of the city, where Martin was buried. The Basilica of Saint Martin was later built on this very site, and is a major site of Christian pilgrimage.

St. Martin was venerated as a saint very soon after his death by popular acclaim. His veneration was widespread in the Middle Ages. Clovis I, whose baptism had immense significance for the history of Western and Central Europe, credited St. Martin’s aid for his military victories, and adopted him as a patron. Devotion to St. Martin continued under the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties, reinforced by writings such as Gregory of Tours’ *Life of St. Martin*.

Many miracles are attributed to St. Martin, including the casting out of demons, the healing of a paralytic, and the turning back of flames from a house while burning down a Roman temple it adjoined. His feast day is celebrated on November 11.
