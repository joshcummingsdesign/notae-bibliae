>St. Lucy [was a] virgin and martyr in the persecution of Diocletian. By the order of the ex-consul Paschasius, she was delivered to corrupt men, that her chastity might be insulted; but when they attempted to lead her away, they could not succeed, either with ropes or with many yokes of oxen. [Despite every attempt to torment her, she remained unharmed and was finally beheaded.]
