<Initial text="Patrick of Ireland"/>

[St. Patrick of Ireland](/glossary/names#patrick) (386–461 AD) was born at the end of Roman rule in Britain. He was not an active believer in his youth, and considered himself in that period to be "idle and callow". At the age of sixteen, he was captured by a group of Irish pirates, and was taken to Ireland where he was enslaved and held captive for six years. The time he spent in captivity was critical to his spiritual development. He worked as a shepherd, and strengthened his relationship with God through prayer. He wrote that the Lord had mercy on his youth and ignorance, and afforded him the opportunity to be forgiven his sins and convert to Christianity.

After six years of captivity, God told him that he would soon go home, and that his ship was ready. He fled his master and traveled to a port two hundred miles away in Wicklow (east Ireland) where he found a ship and persuaded the captain to take him. After three days of sailing, they landed in Britain. The travelers walked for 28 days in the wilderness and became faint from hunger. Patrick strengthened the hearts of his fellow travelers, and urged them to put their faith in God. He then prayed to the Lord for sustenance. Just then, they encountered a herd of wild boar. Because of this, his prestige in the group was greatly increased. Patrick, now in his twenties, returned home to his family and continued his studies.

Patrick recounts that he had a vision a few years after returning home:

> "I saw a man coming, as it were from Ireland. His name was [Victorious], and he carried many letters, and he gave me one of them. I read the heading: "The Voice of the Irish". As I began the letter, I imagined in that moment that I heard the voice of those very people who were near the wood of Foclut, which is beside the western sea—and they cried out, as with one voice: 'We appeal to you, holy servant boy, to come and walk among us.'"

Patrick studied in Europe, principally at Auxerre, France. During this time he visited the Marmoutier Abbey, Tours (a famous French [Benedictine](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) monastery), and received the tonsure at Lérins Abbey (a famous French [Cistercian](/people/saints/medieval/bernard-of-clairvaux) monastery). Germanus of Auxerre, a bishop of the Western Church, ordained him to the priesthood.

Acting on his vision, Patrick returned to Ireland as a Christian missionary. He first arrived in Wicklow, the same port from which he fled, and was not welcomed by the locals. He was forced to leave and seek a more welcoming place further north. He ultimately arrived in Saul (northern Ireland) where he established the first of many churches. During his time in Ireland, Patrick baptized thousands of people, ordained priests, converted wealthy women who became nuns in the face of family opposition, and even converted the sons of kings.

> "Never before did they know of God except to serve idols and unclean things. But now, they have become the people of the Lord, and are called children of God. The sons and daughters of the leaders of the Irish are seen to be monks and virgins of Christ!"

Patrick's position as a foreigner in Ireland was not an easy one. His refusal to accept gifts from kings placed him outside the normal ties of kinship. He was without legal protection, and suffered beatings and imprisonment. Despite all of this, Patrick persevered.

Legend credits Patrick with teaching the Irish about the doctrine of the Holy Trinity by showing people the shamrock, a three-leafed plant, using it to illustrate the Christian teaching of three persons in one God. Other legends include him casting out demons, banishing snakes from Ireland, fasting for forty days on the mountaintop of Cruachan Aigle (Gaelic: "Eagle Peak") (northwest Ireland), healing a pagan chief and his horses after they became ill for refusing to let him build a church, and rebuking an innkeeper, leading her to mend her ways and graciously serve whiskey to her patrons.

After 40 years of living in poverty, teaching, traveling, and working tirelessly, Patrick died on March 17, 461 in Saul, where he had built his first church. Having been born before the current laws of the Catholic Church, Patrick was never formally canonized. Nevertheless, he is known as the "Apostle of Ireland".
