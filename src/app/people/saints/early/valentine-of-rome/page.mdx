<Initial text="Valentine of Rome"/>

At least three different [Valentines](/glossary/names#valentine), all of them martyrs, are mentioned in the early martyrologies under date of February 14. One is described as a priest at Rome, another as bishop of Interamna (modern Terni in central Italy), and these two seem both to have suffered in the second half of the third century and to have been buried on the Via Flaminia (or "Flaminian Way", an ancient Roman road where Constantine is said to have had his vision that led him to Christianity). Of the third Saint Valentine, who suffered in Africa with a number of companions, nothing further is known. In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church removed St. Valentine from the General Roman Calendar, because so little is known about him. However, the church still recognizes him as a saint, listing him in the February 14 spot of Roman Martyrolgy.

A common hagiography describes Saint Valentine as a priest of Rome or as the former Bishop of Terni, an important town of Umbria, in central Italy. While under house arrest of Judge Asterius, and discussing his faith with him, Valentine was discussing the validity of Jesus. The judge put Valentine to the test and brought to him the judge's adopted blind daughter. If Valentine succeeded in restoring the girl's sight, Asterius would do whatever he asked. Valentine, praying to God, laid his hands on her eyes and the child's vision was restored.

Immediately humbled, the judge asked Valentine what he should do. Valentine replied that all of the idols around the judge's house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo the Christian sacrament of Baptism. The judge obeyed and, as a result of his fasting and prayer, freed all the Christian inmates under his authority. The judge, his family, and his forty-four member household of adult family members and servants were baptized.

Valentine was later arrested again for continuing to evangelize. He was sent to the prefect of Rome, to emperor Claudius II. Claudius took a liking to him until Valentine tried to convince Claudius to embrace Christianity. Claudius refused and condemned Valentine to death, commanding that Valentine either renounce his faith or he would be beaten with clubs and beheaded. Valentine refused and was executed outside the Flaminian Gate on February 14, 269.

An embellishment to this account states that before his execution, Saint Valentine wrote a note to Asterius' daughter signed "from your Valentine", which is said to have inspired today's tradition.

Another legend is that Valentine defied the order of the emperor Claudius and secretly performed Christian weddings for couples, allowing the husbands involved to escape enlistment into the army. To remind these men of their vows and God's love, Valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment, giving them to these persecuted Christians, a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on Valentine's Day.

Many of the popular customs associated with Valentine's Day are said to have their origin in a conventional belief generally received in England and France during the Middle Ages, that on February 14, i.e. half way through the second month of the year, the birds began to pair. Geoffrey Chaucer, 14th-century English poet, wrote, "For this was sent on St. Valentine's day. When every foul cometh to choose his mate." For this reason the day was looked upon as specially consecrated to lovers and as a proper occasion for writing love letters and sending lovers' tokens.
