<Initial text="Valentine of Rome" />

[St. Valentine of Rome](/glossary/names#valentine) (d. 269), was either a priest in Rome, or Bishop of Interamna (modern Terni in central Italy). In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church removed St. Valentine from the General Roman Calendar, because so little is known about him. However, the church still recognizes him as a saint.

Valentine was put on house arrest for preaching the gospel, and the judge, Asterius, put Valentine to the test by bringing him his blind daughter. If Valentine succeeded in restoring the girl's sight, Asterius would do whatever he asked. Valentine, praying to God, laid his hands on her eyes and the child's vision was restored.

Immediately humbled, the judge asked Valentine what he should do. Valentine replied that all of the idols around the judge's house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo the Christian sacrament of Baptism. The judge obeyed and, as a result of his fasting and prayer, freed all the Christian inmates under his authority. The judge, his family, and his forty-four member household of adult family members and servants were baptized.

Valentine was later arrested again, and was sent to Emperor Claudius II. Claudius took a liking to him until Valentine tried to convince Claudius to embrace Christianity. Claudius refused and condemned Valentine to death, commanding that Valentine either renounce his faith or be beaten with clubs and beheaded. Valentine refused and was executed outside the Flaminian Gate on February 14, 269.

An embellishment to this account states that before his execution, Saint Valentine wrote a note to Asterius' daughter signed "from your Valentine", which is said to have inspired today's tradition.

Another legend is that Valentine defied the order of the emperor Claudius and secretly performed Christian weddings for couples, allowing the husbands involved to escape enlistment into the army. To remind these men of their vows and God's love, Valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment, giving them to these persecuted Christians, a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on Valentine's Day.

Many of the popular customs associated with Valentine's Day are said to have their origin in a conventional belief, generally received in England and France during the Middle Ages, that on February 14 (half way through the second month of the year), the birds began to pair. Geoffrey Chaucer, 14th-century English poet, wrote, "For this was sent on St. Valentine's day. When every foul cometh to choose his mate." For this reason the day was looked upon as specially consecrated to lovers and as a proper occasion for writing love letters and sending lovers' tokens.
