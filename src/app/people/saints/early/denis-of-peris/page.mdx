## Readings

> St. Gregory of Tours, writing in the sixth century, tells us that St. Denis of Paris was born in Italy and sent in the year 250 with six other missionary bishops into Gaul, where he suffered martyrdom. *The Martyrology of Jerome* mentions St. Denis on October 9, joining him with St. Rusticus and St. Eleutherius; later writers make of these the bishop's priest and deacon, who with him penetrated to Lutetia Parisiorum and established Christian worship on an island in the Seine. Their preaching was so effective that they were arrested and, after a long imprisonment, all three were beheaded.

> The bodies of the Martyrs [St. Denis and his companions] were thrown into the Seine, from which they were rescued and given honourable burial. A chapel was later built over their tomb, around which arose the great abbey of St. Denis. The cult of St. Denis was very strong during the middle ages; already in the sixth century Fortunatus recognizes him as the saint of Paris *par excellence*, and he is popularly regarded as the patron saint of France.
