<Initial text="Hippolytus of Rome" />

[St. Hippolytus of Rome](/glossary/names#hippolytus) (170–235 AD) was a presbyter in Rome who was distinguished for his learning and eloquence. He was the leader of the Greek-speaking Christians of Rome; [Origen](/people/scholars/origen), then a young man, heard him preach. Hippolytus championed the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="logos" text="Logos" /> doctrine of the Greek apologists, most notably [St. Justin Martyr](/people/saints/greek-fathers/justin-martyr), which distinguished the Father from the Logos ("Word"). A rigorist, Hippolytus was elected as a rival bishop, opposing the Roman Popes who had softened the penitential system to accommodate the large number of new pagan converts. Later, however, the two parties were ultimately reconciled. During the persecution at the time of Emperor Maximinus Thrax, Hippolytus was exiled to Sardinia (island in the Mediterranean Sea west of Italy) in 235 AD, likely dying in the mines.

Hippolytus' voluminous writings include exegesis, homiletics, apologetics and polemic, chronography, and ecclesiastical law. Of exegetical works attributed to Hippolytus, the best preserved are the *Commentary on the Prophet Daniel* and the *Commentary on the Song of Songs*. The latter is the earliest attested Christian interpretation Song of Songs, covering only the first three chapters. Scholars generally ascribe to Hippolytus a work now entitled the *Apostolic Tradition*. The *Apostolic Tradition* is an early Christian treatise on church orders. It has been described to be of incomparable importance as a source of information about church life and liturgy in the 3rd century. It describes, for example, the process of <Definition lang="greek" anchor="katekhesis" text="catechesis" />, and contains the earliest known description of ordination. In the great compilations of ecclesiastical law that arose in the East since the 3rd century, many canons were attributed to Hippolytus.
