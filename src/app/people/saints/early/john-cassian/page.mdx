[St. John Cassian](/glossary/names#john) (360–435 AD) was born in the region of Scythia Minor (now Dobruja, a historical region shared today by Romania and Bulgaria). The son of wealthy parents, he received a good education. He was bilingual in Latin and Greek. As a young adult he traveled to Palestine with an older friend Germanus, with whom he would spend much of the next twenty-five years. There they entered a hermitage near Bethlehem. After remaining in that community for about three years, they journeyed to the Desert of Scetis in northrn Egypt. There they visited a number of monastic foundations.

In around 399 AD, Cassian and Germanus faced the [Origenist](/people/scholars/origen) controversy. Following an unsuccessful journey to Alexandria to protest the matter, Cassian and Germanus fled with about 300 AD other Origenist monks. Cassian and Germanus went to Constantinople, where they appealed to the patriarch, [St. John Chrysostom](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-chrysostom), for protection. Cassian was ordained a deacon and became a member of the clergy. When the Chrysostom was forced into exile from Constantinople in 404 AD, the Latin-speaking Cassian was sent to Rome to plead his cause before Pope Innocent I.

While he was in Rome, Cassian accepted the invitation to found an Egyptian-style monastery in southern Gaul (modern France), near Marseille. He arrived in Marseille around 415 AD. His foundation, the Abbey of St Victor, was a complex of monasteries for both men and women, one of the first such institutes in the West, and served as a model for later monastic development.

Cassian wrote two major spiritual works, the *De institutis coenobiorum* (Latin "Institutes of the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="koinobion" text="Coenobia" />") and the *Collationes patrum in scetica eremo* (Latin: "Conferences of the [Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers)"). In these, he codified and transmitted the wisdom of the Desert Fathers of Egypt. His books were written in Latin, in a simple, direct style. They were swiftly translated into Greek, which indicates the Eastern monks recognized him as one of their own. Some of his works had been translated into Georgian by the 11th century.

The *Institutes* was meant to help the Bishop of Apt (modern southeastern France) establish a monastery following the model of Egypt, in contrast to the existing monastic life in Gaul. It deals primarily with the external organization of monastic communities. Books 1-4 discuss clothing, prayer, and rules of monastic life. Books 5-12 are rules on morality, specifically addressing the eight vices: gluttony, lust, greed, hubris, wrath, envy, listlessness, and boasting. Cassian also pays considerable attention to analyzing the will, treating the corrupt will, and chiefly subordinating even the good will for the good of the community and ultimately, the will of God.

The *Conferences* deals with "the training of the inner man and the perfection of the heart." It summarizes important conversations that Cassian had with elders from the monastery at Scetis about principles of the spiritual and ascetic life.

Cassian's achievements and writings influenced [St. Benedict](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia), who incorporated many of the principles into his monastic rule, and recommended to his own monks that they read the works of Cassian. Benedict's rule is still followed by Benedictine and [Cistercian](/people/saints/medieval/bernard-of-clairvaux) monks, and John Cassian's thought still exercises influence over the spiritual lives of thousands of men and women in the Latin Church.

Although later theologians have labeled Cassian as Semipelagian—due to the fact that he stressed the role of the human will as opposed to [St. Augustine's](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) stress on the totality of grace—his work had an immeasurable effect on Western Europe. Not only did he influence Benedict of Nursia and [St. Dominic](/people/saints/medieval/dominic-of-osma), [Pope St. Gregory I](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great) drew influence from Cassian in his teaching on the seven deadly sins, as well as in much of his teaching on repentance and prayer.

Like his contemporaries Augustine and Chrysostom, John Cassian was never formally canonized, a process that came into use several centuries after his death. Nonetheless, the Western Church ranks him as a saint.
