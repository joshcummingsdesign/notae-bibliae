<Initial text="Epiphanius of Salamis"/>

[St. Epiphanius of Salamis](/glossary/names#epiphanius) (310–403 AD) was a Romaniote Jew (a distinct Greek Jewish community with ancient roots) that was born in the small settlement of Besanduk—about 25 miles northwest of Hebron. He became a Christian after seeing how a monk named Lucian gave away his clothing to a poor person. Struck by the monk's compassion, Epiphanius asked him to instruct him in Christianity.

After his baptism, Epiphanius became a member of a monastery in Egypt under the guidance of the [St. Hilarion](/people/saints/early/hilarion-the-great). As he progressed as an ascetic in the monastic life, he occupied himself copying Greek books. In his quest to avoid human glory, Epiphanius set out to the desert where robbers fell upon him and held him for three months. Epiphanius spoke to the robbers about repentance, and when he was set free, one of the robbers joined him. Epiphanius took him to his monastery and baptized him with the name John. From that time John became a faithful disciple of Epiphanius and carefully recorded in writing about the life and miracles of his spiritual guide.

Returning to the wilderness of Palestine in around 333 AD, Epiphanius again sought the ascetic life with his disciple John. As the reputation of Epiphanius spread, more disciples came to him leading to his founding a monastery in Ad near his hometown. There he was ordained a priest and became the superior. He led the monastery for some thirty years during which he learned to speak many languages including Hebrew, Syriac, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin. For this [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) called him *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="pentaglossos" text="Pentaglossos"/>*.

Epiphanius' reputation for learning prompted his nomination and consecration as Bishop of Salamis (northeast Cyprus) in 367 AD. A year later, he was elected Metropolitan. He served as bishop for nearly forty years, and traveled widely to preach, teach, and combat heresy. Epiphanius was present at a synod in Antioch in 376 AD to debate against Apollinarianism (Christ is fully God, but not fully man). In 382 AD, Epiphanius upheld the cause of Paulinus during the Council of Rome, which attempted to reconcile the Meletian schism.

Rufinus of Aquileia (modern northeastern Italy), a monk and [Origenist](/people/scholars/origen) theologian, came into conflict with Jerome over the orthodoxy of Origen's teachings. While preaching in Jerusalem, Epiphanius opposed Origen's followers and urged the Bishop of Jerusalem, John II, to condemn his writings. He urged John to be careful about the use of images in the church. Epiphanius noted that he went into a church in Anablatha near Bethel to pray and saw a curtain with an image of Christ or a saint which he tore down. He told Bishop John that such images were opposed to the teaching of the Scriptures. Conflict between Rufinus and Jerome only escalated when Epiphanius ordained a priest for Jerome's monastery at Bethlehem, thus trespassing on John's jurisdiction.

In 399 AD, the dispute took on another dimension, when the Bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus, who had initially supported John II, changed his views and started persecuting Origenist monks in Egypt. As a result of this persecution, four of these monks, known as the Tall Brothers (four monks from Nitria—northeastern Egypt—so named because of their tall stature), fled to Palestine, and then traveled to Constantinople, seeking support and spreading the controversy. [St. John Chrysostom](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-chrysostom), Bishop of Constantinople, gave the monks shelter. In 402 AD, Theophilus—who was against Chrysostom—summoned a council in Constantinople, and invited those supportive of his anti-Origenist views. Epiphanius, by this time nearly 80, was one of those summoned, and began the journey to Constantinople. However, when he realized he was only being used by Theophilus against Chrysostom, he started back to Salamis, only to die on the way home in 403 AD.

Epiphanius' best-known book is the *Panarion* (Latin: "Bread Basket"), also known as *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="adversus-haereses" text="Adversus Haereses" />*, presented as a book of antidotes for those bitten by the serpent of heresy. Written between 374–377 AD, it forms a handbook for dealing with the arguments of heretics. His earliest known work is the *Ancoratus* (Latin: "The Well-Anchored Man"), which includes arguments against Arianism and the teachings of Origen. Epiphanius composed a historical look at the Bible called *On Weights and Measures* in Constantinople for a Persian priest, in 392 AD, which survived in Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian translations.
