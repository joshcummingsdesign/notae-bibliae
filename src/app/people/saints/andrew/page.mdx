<Initial text="Andrew"/>

[St. Andrew's](/glossary/names#peter) was a fisherman from Bethsaida (north of the Sea of Galilee). He was a disciple of [St. John the Baptist](/people/saints/john-the-baptist) who began to follow Jesus when he heard John say that he was the "Lamb of God" (John 1:40). Andrew told his brother Simon that Jesus is the Messiah, and brought him to see Jesus. Jesus then renamed his brother [Peter](/people/saints/peter) (John 1:41-42).

Andrew was there when Jesus fed the five thousand (John 6:8-9). He and [Philip](/people/saints/philip) went to Jesus when some Greeks wished to see him after his triumphal entry into Jerusalem (John 12:20-22). Andrew was with Peter, [James](/people/saints/james), and [John](/people/saints/john) when they asked Jesus what the signs of the end of the age would be on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3-4).
