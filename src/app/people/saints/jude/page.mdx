<Initial text="Jude"/>

[St. Jude](/glossary/names#judah) was the brother of [St. James the Less](/people/saints/james-the-less) and [St. Matthew](/people/saints/matthew). James, Jude, and Matthew were sons of [Cleopas](/glossary/names#cleopas), one of the men who encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas was married to [St. Joseph's](/people/saints/joseph) sister Mary (John 19:25). This makes James, Jude, and Matthew cousins of Jesus (Matt. 9:9) (Mark 2:14) (Matt. 10:3) (Matt. 13:55).

Jude's Greek name is [Thaddaeus](/glossary/names#thaddaeus), and he was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:3).

When Jesus promised the Holy Spirit, Jude asked, "Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?" (John 14:22). He is the author of the [Epistle of Jude](/bible/new-testament/epistles/jude).
