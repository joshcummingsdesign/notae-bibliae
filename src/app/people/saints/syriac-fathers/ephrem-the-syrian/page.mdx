<Initial text="Ephrem the Syrian"/>

[St. Ephrem the Syrian](/glossary/names#ephraim) (306–379) was born in Nisibis (modern Nusaybin in southeast Turkey). In those days, religious culture in the region of Nisibis included local polytheism, Judaism and several varieties of the Early Christianity. Most of the population spoke the Aramaic language, while Greek and Latin were languages of administration. The city had a complex ethnic composition, consisting of Assyrians, Arabs, Greeks, Jews, Romans, and Iranians.

Jacob, the second Bishop of Nisibis, was appointed in 308, and Ephrem grew up under his leadership. Jacob of Nisibis is recorded as a signatory at the First Council of Nicea in 325. Ephrem was baptized as a youth and almost certainly became a "son of the covenant", a form of Syriac proto-monasticism. Jacob appointed Ephrem as a deacon and a teacher, and Ephrem began to compose hymns and write biblical commentaries as part of his educational office. In his hymns, he sometimes refers to himself as a "herdsman", to his bishop as the "shepherd", and to his community as a "fold". Ephrem is popularly credited as the founder of the School of Nisibis, which, in later centuries, was the center of learning of the Church of the East.

After the death of Constantine in 337, Shapur II of Persia began a series of attacks into Roman North Mesopotamia. Nisibis was besieged in 338, 346 and 350. During the first siege, Ephrem credits Bishop Jacob as defending the city with his prayers. In the third siege, of 350, Shapur rerouted the River Mygdonius to undermine the walls of Nisibis. The Nisibenes quickly repaired the walls while the Persian elephant cavalry became bogged down in the wet ground. Ephrem celebrated what he saw as the miraculous salvation of the city in a hymn that portrayed Nisibis as being like Noah's Ark, floating to safety on the flood.

In 359, Shapur attacked again. The cities around Nisibis were destroyed one by one, and their citizens killed or deported. Constantius II was unable to respond; the campaign of Julian in 363 ended with his death in battle. His army elected Jovian as the new emperor, and to rescue his army, he was forced to surrender Nisibis to Persia, and to permit the expulsion of the entire Christian population. Ephrem declined being ordained a bishop by feigning madness, because he regarded himself unworthy for it.

Ephrem, with the others, went first to Amida (modern Diyarbakır, Turkey), eventually settling in Edessa (modern Urfa, Turkey) in 363. Ephrem, in his late fifties, applied himself to ministry in his new church and seems to have continued his work as a teacher, perhaps in the School of Edessa. Edessa had been an important center of the Aramaic-speaking world, and the birthplace of a specific Middle Aramaic dialect that came to be known as the Syriac language.

The city was rich with rivaling philosophies and religions. Ephrem comments that orthodox Nicene Christians were simply called "Palutians" (named after Palut, Bishop of Edessa). Arians, Marcionites, Manichees, Bardaisanites and various Gnostic sects proclaimed themselves as the true church. In this confusion, Ephrem wrote a great number of hymns defending Nicene orthodoxy. A later Syriac writer, [St. Jacob of Serugh](/people/saints/syriac-fathers/jacob-of-serugh), wrote that Ephrem rehearsed all-female choirs to sing his hymns set to Syriac folk tunes in the forum of Edessa. In 370 he visited [St. Basil](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/basil-the-great) at Caesarea, and then journeyed to the monks of Egypt. After a ten-year residency in Edessa, in his sixties, Ephrem succumbed to the plague.

Over four hundred hymns composed by Ephrem still exist. These hymns are full of rich, poetic imagery drawn from biblical sources. Some of these hymns provide implicit insight into Ephrem's perceived level of comfort with incorporating feminine imagery into his writings. One such hymn cycle was *Hymns on the Nativity*, centered around Mary. Particularly influential were his *Hymns Against Heresies*. Ephrem used these to warn his flock of the heresies that threatened to divide the early church. These hymns employed colorful metaphors to describe the Incarnation of Christ as fully human and divine. Ephrem asserted that Christ's unity of humanity and divinity represents peace, perfection and salvation; in contrast, Docetism and other heresies sought to divide or reduce Christ's nature and, in doing so, rend and devalue Christ's followers with their false teachings.

Ephrem, like many Syriac liturgical poets, believed that women's voices were important to hear in the church as they were modeled after Mary, mother of Jesus, whose acceptance of God's call led to salvation for all through the birth of Jesus. Through the role of singing Ephrem's hymns, women's choirs were granted a role in worship.

Ephrem wrote a wide variety of hymns, poems, and sermons in verse, as well as prose exegesis. These were works of practical theology for the edification of the Church in troubled times. He has been called the most significant of all of the Fathers of the Syriac-speaking church tradition. Ephrem is venerated as an example of monastic discipline in Eastern Christianity. On October 5, 1920, Pope Benedict XV proclaimed Ephrem a Doctor of the Church. The most popular title for Ephrem is "Harp of the Spirit".
