<Initial text="Isaac of Nineveh"/>

[St. Isaac of Nineveh](/glossary/names#isaac) (613–700 AD) was born in the region of Beth Qatraye in Eastern Arabia, a mixed Syriac and Arabic speaking region encompassing the south east of Mesopotamia and the north eastern Arabian peninsula. When still quite young, he entered a monastery where he devoted his energies towards the practice of asceticism. After many years of studying at the library attached to the monastery, he emerged as an authoritative figure in theology. Shortly after, he dedicated his life to monasticism and became involved in religious education throughout the Beth Qatraye region. When the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="katholikos" text="Catholicos" /> Giwargis I ("Catholicos" is a title for the patriarch which used in some Eastern churches such as the Oriental Orthodox Church) visited Beth Qatraye in 676 to attend a synod, he ordained Isaac bishop of Nineveh far to the north in Assyria.

The administrative duties did not suit his retiring and ascetic bent—he requested to abdicate after only five months, and went south to the wilderness of Mount Matout, a refuge for anchorites (Greek: *ἀναχωρέω*, *anakhōréō*, "withdraw" or "retire", a type of hermit who took special vows). There he lived in solitude for many years, eating only three loaves a week with some uncooked vegetables. Eventually blindness and old age forced him to retire to the Assyrian monastery of Rabban Shabur in Mesopotamia, where he died and was buried. At the time of his death he was nearly blind, a fact that some attribute to his devotion to study.

Isaac was a prolific writer, and is remembered both for his books and his spiritual homilies on the inner life. His writings (in Syriac) survived antiquity and were translated into Greek, Latin, and Arabic. He stands in the tradition of the eastern mystical saints, and placed a considerable emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit. Isaac's writings offer a rare example of a large corpus of ascetical texts written by an experienced hermit, and is thus an important writer when it comes to understanding early Christian asceticism.
