<Initial text="Syriac Fathers" />

The Syriac Fathers are Church Fathers who wrote in Syriac between the 3rd and 8th centuries. Syriac is an Aramaic dialect that emerged during the 1st century AD. During the Early Christian period, it became the main literary language of various Aramaic-speaking Christian communities in the historical region of Ancient Syria and throughout the Near East. Many important early Christian Syriac texts have been preserved, and Syriac is still used by Syrian Christians as a liturgical language to this day.
