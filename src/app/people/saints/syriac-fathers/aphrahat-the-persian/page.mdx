<Initial text="Aphrahat the Persian"/>

[St. Aphrahat the Persian](/glossary/names#aphrahat) (270–345 AD) was born near the border of Roman Syria in Neo-Persian Iran around 280 AD. He may have had Persian Jewish ancestors. He is also known as "the Persian sage". He came from a pagan family, and took the name Jacob at his baptism. His writings emerged during the beginning of the persecution of Christians in the early 340s by Iranian emperor Shapur II. The persecutions arose out of political tensions between Rome and Persia, particularly the declaration of Constantine the Great that Rome should be a Christian empire. There are elements in Aphrahat's writing that show great pastoral concern in the midst of this turmoil. Aphrahat was likely a monk and a bishop.

Aphrahat's works are collectively called *The Demonstrations*, from the identical first word in each of their titles. They are sometimes also known as "the homilies". There are twenty-three Demonstrations in all. Each work deals with a different item of faith or practice. Some say they are intended to form a full and ordered exposition of the Christian faith. Beginning with faith as the foundation, Aphrahat proceeds to build up the structure of doctrine and duty. *The Demonstrations* are works of prose, but frequently, Aphrahat employs a poetic rhythm and imagery to his writing. Each of the first twenty-two Demonstrations begins with each successive letter of the Syriac alphabet (of which there are twenty-two).

*The Demonstrations* were not composed all at one time, but in three distinct periods. The first ten, composed in 337 AD, concern themselves with Christian life and church order, and predate the persecutions. Demonstrations 11–22 were composed in 344 AD, at the height of the persecution. Some of this group deal with matters as before, others focus on apocalyptic themes, however, four Demonstrations are concerned with Judaism. The twenty-third Demonstration falls outside of the alphabetic system of the early works, and appears to be slightly later, perhaps near the end of Aphrahat's life. The twenty-third piece takes the symbolism of the grape, drawn from Isaiah 65 and elsewhere, and deals with the fulfillment of Messianic promise from Adam to Christ. Aphrahat never strays too far from the Bible in the Demonstrations. All of his gospel quotations seem to be drawn from the *Diatessaron* (Latin: "across four"), a gospel harmony by Tatian, a 2nd century Assyrian Christian apologist and ascetic. *The Demonstrations* were originally composed in the Syriac language, but were quickly translated into other languages.
