<Initial text="Jacob of Serugh" />

[St. Jacob of Serugh](/glossary/names#jacob) (451–521 AD) was born in the village of Kurtam on the Euphrates in the ancient region of Serugh (modern southeastern Turkey). He was educated in the School of Edessa, and became <Definition lang="greek" anchor="khorepiskopos" text="chorepiscopus" /> in the Serugh area, serving rural churches of Haura. His tenure of this office extended over a time of great trouble to the Christian population of Mesopotamia, due to the fierce war carried on by the Sasanian Empire (a powerful Iranian dynasty that ruled over Persia and parts of the Near East).

In 444 AD, a presbyter named Eutyches from Constantinople began teaching a variation of traditional Christology to combat what he saw as a resurgence of Nestorianism (Christ was a union of two distinct persons—one divine and one human—rather than a single person with two natures). Eutyches taught that after the Incarnation, Christ had only one nature, which was primarily divine. He argued that the human nature of Christ was absorbed or subsumed into his divine nature, resulting in a single, unified nature. In 451 AD, the year Jacob was born, the Council of Chalcedon was held, which rejected the heresy of Eutyches who denied the true human nature of the Son of God, and affirmed the union in his one Person, without confusion and without separation of his two natures, human and divine. Jacob was a Miaphysite (Christ is fully divine and fully human in one nature, a view still held by the Oriental Orthodox Churches), and he lived through the intense rifts that split Eastern Christianity, which led to most Syriac speakers being separated from Byzantine communion.

In 519 AD and at the age of 67, Jacob was elected bishop of the main city area called Batnan. He was one of the foremost poets and theologians of the Syriac Christian tradition, second only to [St. Ephrem the Syrian](/people/saints/syriac-fathers/ephrem-the-syrian). Jacob is best known for the homilies he wrote in the late fifth and early sixth centuries. He composed 763 works during his lifetime. Around 400 survive, and over 200 of those have been published. His works were so popular that of any author from late antiquity, only the writings of [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) and [St. John Chrysostom](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-chrysostom) survive in a greater number of manuscripts than Jacob's. His work earned him many nicknames, such as the "Flute of the Holy Spirit" and the "Harp of the Church".

> "The Scripture enlightens the eyes of the soul with its readings; read it O man of discernment, and enabled by love, be filled with the light therefrom. From the divine readings a sun dawns on the minds that encounter them with discretion. God has placed the Scriptures in the world like lamps of great light in the midst of darkness, for the world to be lightened by them; the soul of him that has love receives light from the readings, and he walks through their realms as in broad daylight. Approach the Scripture with love and behold its fairness, for it will not let thee see its face except for the sake of love. Without love, though thou read, thou wilt not profit, because love is the door whereby one enters in unto the meaning."
