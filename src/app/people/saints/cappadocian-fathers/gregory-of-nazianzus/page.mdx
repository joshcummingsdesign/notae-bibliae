<Initial text="Gregory of Nazianzus" />

[St. Gregory of Nazianzus](/glossary/names#gregory) (329–390 AD) was one of the three [Cappadocian Fathers](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers) along with his friend [St. Basil](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/basil-the-great) and Basil's brother [St. Gregory of Nyssa](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/gregory-of-nyssa).

Gregory was born to Greek parents in the family estate of Karbala outside the village of Arianzus, near Nazianzus, in southwest Cappadocia (Asia Minor, modern Turkey). In 325 AD, his mother Nonna converted her husband Gregory to Christianity, and he was subsequently ordained as Bishop of Nazianzus. His friend Basil the Great was educated in Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia (modern Kayseri) around 350 AD where he and Gregory met. Gregory went to Alexandria, while Basil went to Constantinople for further studies. Gregory then headed off for Athens, but on the way his ship encountered a violent storm, and the terrified Gregory prayed to Christ that if he would deliver him, he would dedicate his life to his service. When he arrived in Athens, he reconnected with Basil the Great, and the two became fast friends. Shortly after, Gregory was baptized.

In 358 AD, Basil founded a monastic settlement on his family's estate near Annesi (northern Asia Minor). He invited Gregory of Nazianzus to join him, and they collaborated on *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="philokalia" text="Origen's Philocalia" />*, a collection of [Origen's](/people/scholars/origen) works.

In 361 AD, Gregory returned to Nazianzus and was ordained a presbyter. Around this time, Emperor Julian had publicly declared himself in opposition to Christianity. In response to the emperor's rejection of the Christian faith, Gregory composed his *Invectives Against Julian* between 362–363 AD. *Invectives* asserts that Christianity will overcome imperfect rulers such as Julian through love and patience. This process as described by Gregory is the public manifestation of the process of deification (theosis), which leads to a spiritual elevation and mystical union with God. Julian resolved to vigorously persecute Gregory and his other Christian critics; however, the emperor perished the following year during a campaign against the Persians.

Gregory spent the next few years combating Arianism, which threatened to divide the region of Cappadocia. He and Basil the Great entered a period of close fraternal cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors. In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of the Emperor Valens, Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the church. Basil, who had long displayed inclinations to the episcopacy, was elected Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia in 370 AD.

In 372 AD, Basil ordained Gregory Bishop of Sasima (in Cappadocia) in order to strengthen his position in his dispute with Anthimus, Bishop of Tyana (in Cappadocia). Unwilling to continue the role in order to advance Basil's interests, Gregory returned to Nazianzus to assist his dying father with the administration of his diocese. It was here that Gregory preached the first of his great episcopal orations.

Following the deaths of his mother and father in 374 AD, Gregory continued to administer the Diocese of Nazianzus but refused to be named bishop. Donating most of his inheritance to the needy, he lived an austere existence. At the end of 375 AD, he withdrew to a monastery at Seleucia (modern Iraq), living there for three years. Near the end of this period, his friend Basil died. Although Gregory's health did not permit him to attend the funeral, he wrote a heartfelt letter of condolence to Basil's brother, Gregory of Nyssa, and composed twelve memorial poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend.

In 379 AD, the Antioch synod and its archbishop, Meletios, asked Gregory to go to Constantinople to lead a theological campaign to win over that city to Nicene orthodoxy. His cousin Theodosia offered him a villa for his residence; Gregory immediately transformed much of it into a church, naming it <Definition lang="greek" anchor="anastasis" text="Anastasia" />, as in "the resurrection of the faith". From this little chapel he delivered five powerful discourses on Nicene doctrine, explaining the nature of the Trinity and the unity of the Godhead. Refuting the denial of the Holy Spirit's divinity, Gregory offered this argument:

> "Look at these facts: Christ is born; the Spirit is his Forerunner. He is baptized; the Spirit bears witness. He is tempted; the Spirit leads him up. He works miracles; the Spirit accompanies them. He ascends; the Spirit takes his place. What great things are there in the idea of God which are not in his power? What titles which belong to God are not applied to him, except only Unbegotten and Begotten? For it was needful that the distinctive properties of the Father and the Son should remain peculiar to Them, lest there should be confusion in the Godhead Which brings all things, even disorder itself, into due arrangement and good order. Indeed I tremble when I think of the abundance of the titles, and how many Names they outrage who fall foul of the Spirit."

In response to Apollinarius' teachings that Jesus was not fully man, but had a divine will and intellect, Gregory responded:

> "If anyone has put his trust in him as a Man without a human mind, he is really bereft of mind, and quite unworthy of salvation. For that which he has not assumed he has not healed; but that which is united to his Godhead is also saved. If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole nature of him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole. Let them not, then, begrudge us our complete salvation, or clothe the Saviour only with bones and nerves and the portraiture of humanity."

Gregory's homilies were well received and attracted ever-growing crowds to Anastasia. Fearing his popularity, his opponents decided to strike. On the vigil of Easter in 379 AD, an Arian mob burst into his church during worship services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop. Escaping the mob, Gregory next found himself betrayed by his former friend, the philosopher Maximus the Cynic. Maximus, who was in secret alliance with Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, attempted to seize Gregory's position and have himself ordained Bishop of Constantinople.  Shocked, Gregory decided to resign his office, but the faction faithful to him induced him to stay and ejected Maximus.

Affairs in Constantinople remained confused as Gregory's position was still unofficial, and Arian priests yet occupied many important churches. The arrival of the emperor Theodosius in 380 AD settled matters in Gregory's favor. The emperor, determined to eliminate Arianism, expelled Bishop Demophilus of Constantinople. Gregory was subsequently enthroned as Bishop of Constantinople at the Basilica of the Apostles, replacing Demophilus.

In 381 AD, Gregory and Theodosius convened the Second Ecumenical Council in Constantinople, which was attended by 150 Eastern bishops. Once there, they refused to recognize Gregory's position as head of the church of Constantinople, arguing that his transfer from the See of Sasima was canonically illegitimate. Gregory was physically exhausted and worried that he was losing the confidence of the bishops and the emperor.  Rather than press his case and risk further division, he decided to resign his office:

> "Whatever this assembly may hereafter determine concerning me, I would fain raise your mind beforehand to something far higher: I pray you now, be one, and join yourselves in love! Must we always be only derided as infallible, and be animated only by one thing, the spirit of strife? Give each other the hand fraternally. But I will be a second Jonah. I will give myself for the salvation of our ship (the church), though I am innocent of the storm. Let the lot fall upon me, and cast me into the sea. A hospitable fish of the deep will receive me. This shall be the beginning of your harmony. I reluctantly ascended the episcopal chair, and gladly I now come down. Even my weak body advises me this. One debt only have I to pay: death; this I owe to God. But, O my Trinity! for Thy sake only am I sad. Shalt Thou have an able man, bold and zealous to vindicate Thee? Farewell, and remember my labors and my pains."

The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address and then departed.

Returning to his homeland of Cappadocia, Gregory once again resumed his position as Bishop of Nazianzus. He eventually withdrew to his family's estate in Arianzus where he died in 390 AD.
