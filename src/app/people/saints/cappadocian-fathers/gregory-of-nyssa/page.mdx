<Initial text="Gregory of Nyssa" />

[St. Gregory of Nyssa](/glossary/names#gregory) (335–394 AD) was one of the three [Cappadocian Fathers](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers) along with his brother [St. Basil](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/basil-the-great) and his friend [St. Gregory of Nazianzus](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/gregory-of-nazianzus).

Gregory was born in or near the city of Neocaesarea, Pontus in the Cappadocia region (Asia Minor, modern northeast Turkey) in around 335 AD. He was one of ten children, and his parents were known for their piety. His maternal grandfather was a Christian martyr, executed in the years prior to Constantine's conversion. Gregory's temperament is said to have been quiet and meek, in contrast to his brother Basil who was known to be much more outspoken. Gregory was first educated at home, by his mother Emmelia and sister Macrina. Little is known of what further education he received. It is likely that he continued his studies in Caesarea, where he read classical literature and philosophy. Gregory himself said that his only teachers were his brother Basil and Paul, John and the rest of the apostles and prophets. Gregory's philosophical writings were influenced by [Origen](/people/scholars/origen).

Gregory's early policies as bishop often went against those of Basil; for instance, while his brother condemned as heretics the Sabellianists (those who denied the doctrine of the Trinity in favor of modalism), Gregory may have tried to reconcile them with the church. Gregory faced much opposition to his reign in Nyssa, and in 376 AD, the synod of Nyssa deposed him. He regained his see in 378, but around that time his brother Basil died, and Gregory took over many of his brother's former responsibilities in Pontus.

Gregory was present at the Synod of Antioch in April 379 AD, where he unsuccessfully attempted to reconcile the followers of Meletius of Antioch with those of Paulinus, who both faced growing Nicene-Arian tension and schism. After visiting the village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he returned to Nyssa in August.

In 380 AD he was elected Bishop of Sebaste (modern central Turkey), but quickly resigned after facing Arian tension. It was around this time that he gave his famous eight homilies on Ecclesiastes. In Homily 4, Gregory begins at Ecc. 2:1. When he gets to Ecc. 2:7, he points out the tragedy of slavery and the great pride of man that lies therein.

> "Do you notice the enormity of the boast? This kind of language is raised up as a challenge to God. For we hear from prophecy that all things are the slaves of the power that transcends all (Ps. 119:90-91). So, when someone turns the property of God into his own property and arrogates dominion to his own kind, so as to think himself the owner of men and women, what is he doing but overstepping his own nature through pride, regarding himself as something different from his subordinates?"

Around 380 AD, Gregory traveled to Jerusalem where [St. Cyril of Jerusalem](/people/saints/greek-fathers/cyril-of-jerusalem) faced opposition from local clergy who accused him of Arianism. Gregory's attempted mediation of the dispute was unsuccessful. Gregory participated in the First Council of Constantinople in 381 AD, and perhaps gave there his famous sermon *In suam ordinationem* (Latin: "In His Organization"). Gregory was present at a synod in 394 AD convened at Constantinople to discuss the continued problems in Bostra (southern Syria).

Gregory died in Nyssa in around 394 AD. Although he is not known for the administrative ability or influence of the other Cappadocian Fathers, he was a highly-influential Christian theologian who made significant contributions to the doctrine of the Trinity and the Nicene Creed.
