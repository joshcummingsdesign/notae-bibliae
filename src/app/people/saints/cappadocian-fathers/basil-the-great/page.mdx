[St. Basil the Great](/glossary/names#basil) (330–379 AD) was one of the three [Cappadocian Fathers](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers) along with his brother [St. Gregory of Nyssa](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/gregory-of-nyssa) and his friend [St. Gregory of Nazianzus](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/gregory-of-nazianzus).

Basil was born in Cappadocia (Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey) in around 330 AD. He was one of ten children, and his parents were known for their piety. His maternal grandfather was a Christian martyr, executed in the years prior to Constantine's conversion. Basil was educated in Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia (modern Kayseri) around 350 AD. There he met Gregory of Nazianzus. Gregory went to Alexandria, while Basil went to Constantinople for further studies. The two later met again in Athens and became fast friends. Basil's life changed radically after he encountered Eustathius of Sebaste, a charismatic bishop and ascetic. Abandoning his legal and teaching career, Basil devoted his life to God. In a letter he described his spiritual awakening:

> "Much time had I spent in vanity, and had wasted nearly all my youth in the vain labour which I underwent in acquiring the wisdom made foolish by God. Then once upon a time, like a man roused from deep sleep, I turned my eyes to the marvellous light of the truth of the Gospel, and I perceived the uselessness of 'the wisdom of the princes of this world, that come to naught' (1 Cor. 2:6)."

After his baptism, Basil traveled in 357 to Palestine, Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia to study ascetics and monasticism. He distributed his fortunes among the poor, and went briefly into solitude, but eventually realized that while he respected the ascetics' piety and prayerfulness, the solitary life did not call him. Basil instead felt drawn toward communal religious life, and by 358 he was gathering around him a group of like-minded disciples, including his brother Peter. Together they founded a monastic settlement on his family's estate near Annesi (northern Asia Minor). His widowed mother Emmelia, sister Macrina, and several other women, joined Basil and devoted themselves to pious lives of prayer and charitable works. There Basil wrote about monastic communal life. His writings became pivotal in developing monastic traditions of the Eastern Church. In 358, Basil invited his friend Gregory of Nazianzus to join him in Annesi. When Gregory eventually arrived, they collaborated on *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="philokalia" text="Origen's Philocalia" />*, a collection of [Origen's](/people/scholars/origen) works. Gregory decided to return to his family in Nazianzus.

Basil attended the Council of Constantinople in 360 AD where he emerged as a strong supporter of the Nicene Creed. In 362, Bishop Meletius of Antioch ordained Basil as a deacon. In 365, he was sent to Caesarea and ordained as a presbyter.

Basil spent the next few years combating Arianism, which threatened to divide the region of Cappadocia. He and Gregory of Nazianzus entered a period of close fraternal cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors. In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of the Emperor Valens, Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the church.

In 370, Basil was ordained bishop of Caesarea. He personally organized a soup kitchen and distributed food to the poor during a famine following a drought. His letters show that he actively worked to reform thieves and prostitutes. They also show him encouraging his clergy not to be tempted by wealth or status, and that he personally took care in selecting worthy candidates for holy orders. He also had the courage to criticize public officials who failed in their duty of administering justice. At the same time, he preached every morning and evening in his own church to large congregations. In addition to all the above, he built a large complex just outside Caesarea, called the Basiliad, which included a poorhouse, hospice, and hospital.

After Basil's death in 379, Gregory of Nazianzus' health did not permit him to attend the funeral, but Gregory wrote a heartfelt letter of condolence to Basil's brother, Gregory of Nyssa, and composed twelve memorial poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend.
