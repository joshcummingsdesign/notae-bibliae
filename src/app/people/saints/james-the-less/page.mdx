<Initial text="James the Less"/>

[St. James the Less](/glossary/names#jude) was the brother of [St. Jude](/people/saints/jude) and [St. Matthew](/people/saints/matthew). James the Less, Jude, and Matthew were sons of [Cleopas](/glossary/names#cleopas), one of the men who encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas was married to [St. Joseph's](/people/saints/joseph) sister Mary (John 19:25), which means that James the Less, Jude, and Matthew were Jesus' cousins (Matt. 9:9) (Mark 2:14) (Matt. 10:3) (Matt. 13:55).

James the Less is also sometimes called "James the Younger" (Mark 15:40), "James the Lord's brother" (Gal. 1:19), or "James the Just". He was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:3).

After the Crucifixion, [St. Peter](/people/saints/peter) and [St. John](/people/saints/john) were among the first to see the empty tomb (John 20:1-2). After [St. Mary Magdalene](/people/saints/mary-magdalene) saw the risen Jesus, she announced to the apostles, "I have seen the Lord" (John 20:18). Jesus then appeared to Peter (Luke 24:34) (1 Cor. 15:3-5), Cleopas and another on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18), and ten of the apostles—all but [St. Thomas](/people/saints/thomas) (John 20:19). Jesus appeared to all of the apostles, including Thomas, eight days later (John 20:26-27). Jesus then appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time (1 Cor. 15:6), and then once more to James the Less before the Ascension (1 Cor. 15:7).

James the Less played a key role in the Jerusalem council (Acts 15:12-14), and is the author of the [Epistle of James](/bible/new-testament/epistles/james).
