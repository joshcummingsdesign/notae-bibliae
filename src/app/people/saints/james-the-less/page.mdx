<Initial text="James the Less"/>

[St. James the Less](/glossary/names#jude) was the brother of [St. Jude](/people/saints/jude) and [St. Matthew](/people/saints/matthew). James, Jude, and Matthew were sons of [Cleopas](/glossary/names#cleopas), one of the men who encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas was married to [St. Joseph's](/people/saints/joseph) sister Mary (John 19:25). This makes James, Jude, and Matthew cousins of Jesus (Matt. 9:9) (Mark 2:14) (Matt. 10:3) (Matt. 13:55).

James the Less is also sometimes called "James the Younger" (Mark 15:40), "James the Lord's brother" (Gal. 1:19), or "James the Just". He was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:3).

After the risen Jesus appeared to more than 500 people, and before his ascension, James had an encounter with him (1 Cor. 15:6-7). James played a key role in the Jerusalem council in Acts 15 (Acts 15:12-14). He is the author of the [Epistle of James](/bible/new-testament/epistles/james).
