<Initial text="Papias of Hierapolis"/>

Very little is known of [St. Papias of Hierapolis](/glossary/names#papias) (60–130 AD) apart from what can be inferred from his own writings. He is described as a "hearer of [St. John](/people/saints/apostles/john) and a companion of [St. Polycarp](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers/polycarp-of-smyrna)" by Polycarp's disciple [St. Irenaeus](/people/saints/greek-fathers/irenaeus-of-lyon). [Eusebius](/people/scholars/eusebius) adds that Papias was Bishop of Hierapolis (modern western Turkey) around the time of [St. Ignatius](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers/ignatius-of-antioch). Papias wrote the *Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord* in five books. This work, which is lost apart from brief excerpts in the works of Irenaeus and Eusebius, is an important early source on Christian oral tradition and especially on the origins of the canonical Gospels.

> "I shall not hesitate also to put into ordered form for you, along with the interpretations, everything I learned carefully in the past from the elders and noted down carefully, for the truth of which I vouch. For unlike most people I took no pleasure in those who told many different stories, but only in those who taught the truth. Nor did I take pleasure in those who reported their memory of someone else's commandments, but only in those who reported their memory of the commandments given by the Lord to the faith and proceeding from the Truth itself. And if by chance anyone who had been in attendance on the elders arrived, I made enquiries about the words of the elders—what Andrew or Peter had said, or Philip or Thomas or James or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord's disciples, and whatever Aristion and John the Elder, the Lord's disciples, were saying. For I did not think that information from the books would profit me as much as information from a living and surviving voice."

Papias, then, inquired of travelers passing through Hierapolis what the surviving disciples of Jesus and the elders—those who had personally known the Twelve Apostles—were saying. One of these disciples was Aristion, likely a bishop in nearby Smyrna, and another was John the Apostle, residing in nearby Ephesus, of whom Papias was a hearer; Papias frequently cited both. From the daughters of Philip, who settled in Hierapolis, Papias learned still other traditions.

Papias provides the earliest extant account of who wrote the Gospels. Eusebius preserves two excerpts from Papias on the origins of the Gospels, one concerning [St. Mark](/people/saints/evangelists/mark) and then another concerning [St. Matthew](/people/saints/apostles/matthew).

On Mark, he says:

> "The Elder used to say: Mark, in his capacity as Peter's interpreter, wrote down accurately as many things as he recalled from memory—though not in an ordered form—of the things either said or done by the Lord. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied him, but later, as I said, Peter, who used to give his teachings in the form of *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="khreia" text="khreiai"/>*, but had no intention of providing an ordered arrangement of the *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="logia" text="logia" />* of the Lord. Consequently Mark did nothing wrong when he wrote down some individual items just as he related them from memory. For he made it his one concern not to omit anything he had heard or to falsify anything."

On Matthew he says:

> Therefore Matthew put the *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="logia" text="logia" />* in an ordered arrangement in the Hebrew language, but each person interpreted them as best he could.

It is thought here that Papias is referring to the Hebrew style of writing, as Matthew's writings were in the Greek language.
