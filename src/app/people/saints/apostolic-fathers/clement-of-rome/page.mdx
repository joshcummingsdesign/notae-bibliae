<Initial text="Clement of Rome"/>

[St. Clement of Rome](/glossary/names#clement) (35–99 AD) was the Bishop of Rome in the late 1st century AD. The *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-pontificalis" text="Liber Pontificalis" />* states that [St. Peter](/people/saints/apostles/peter) ordained two bishops, Linus and Anacletus, for the priestly service of the community, devoting himself instead to prayer and preaching, and that it was to Clement that he entrusted the Church as a whole, appointing him as his successor. [Tertullian](/people/scholars/tertullian) considered Clement to be the immediate successor of St. Peter. In one of his works, [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) listed Clement as "the fourth Bishop of Rome after Peter, if indeed the second was Linus and the third Anacletus, although most of the Latins think that Clement was second after the Apostle." [St. Irenaeus](/people/saints/greek-fathers/irenaeus-of-lyon), the earliest account, puts Clement after Linus and Anacletus. [Eusebius'](/people/scholars/eusebius) account followed Irenaeus.

Clement's only extant, uncontested text is a letter to the Christian congregation in Corinth, often called the *First Epistle of Clement*. It is considered the earliest authentic Christian document outside the New Testament. In the letter, Clement writes to the troubled congregation in Corinth, where certain presbyters had been deposed. Clement calls for repentance and reinstatement of those who had been deposed, in line with maintenance of order and obedience to church authority, since the apostles established their ministry. The epistle offers valuable insight into church history. It mentions persecutions of Christians, records the martyrdom of the St. Peter, and suggests that [St. Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) traveled to Spain.

According to apocryphal stories dating back to the 4th century, Clement was banished from Rome to Chersonesus (an ancient Greek colony near modern Sevastopol, Ukraine) during the reign of the Emperor Trajan, and was set to work in a stone quarry. Finding on his arrival that the prisoners were suffering from lack of water, he knelt down in prayer. Looking up, he saw a lamb on a hill, went to where the lamb had stood and struck the ground with his pickaxe, releasing a gushing stream of clear water. This miracle resulted in the conversion of large numbers of the local pagans and his fellow prisoners to Christianity. As punishment, Clement was martyred by being tied to an anchor and thrown from a boat into the Black Sea.

Clement is commemorated on November 23 as a pope and martyr, and is considered to be the first of the [Apostolic Fathers](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers) of the Church.
