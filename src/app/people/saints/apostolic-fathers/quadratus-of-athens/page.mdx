<Initial text="Quadratus of Athens"/>

[St. Quadratus of Athens](/glossary/names#quadratus) (1st century–129 AD) was a Greek [Apostolic Father](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers). [Eusebius](/people/scholars/eusebius), summarizing a letter by Dionysius of Corinth, states that Quadratus was appointed Bishop of Athens after the martyrdom of its former bishop, Publius, and that through Quadratus' zeal, the Athenian Christians were brought together again and their faith revived. Most of the writings of Quadratus of Athens are lost today, but we do know he wrote an apologetic argument for Christ's deity to Roman Emperor Hadrian in around 124 AD. Eusebius states that Quadratus' apology moved the emperor to issue a favorable edict.

> "To [Hadrian] Quadratus addressed a discourse containing an apology for our religion, because certain wicked men had attempted to trouble the Christians. The work is still in the hands of a great many of the brethren, as also in our own, and furnishes clear proofs of the man's understanding and of his apostolic orthodoxy. [Quadratus] himself reveals the early date at which he lived in the following words: 'But the works of our Savior were always present, for they were genuine—those that were healed, and those that were raised from the dead, who were seen not only when they were healed and when they were raised, but were also always present; and not merely while the Savior was on earth, but also after his death, they were alive for quite a while, so that some of them lived even to our day.' Such then was Quadratus."

Eusebius called him a "man of understanding and of apostolic faith", and [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) called him "disciple of the apostles". Both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have canonized Quadratus of Athens. The Eastern Church also considers him one of the seventy (or seventy-two) disciples mentioned in Luke 10:1.
