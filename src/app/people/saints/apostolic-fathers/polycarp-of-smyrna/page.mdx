[St. Irenaeus](/people/saints/greek-fathers/irenaeus-of-lyon), [Tertullian](/people/scholars/tertullian), and [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) all wrote that [St. Polycarp of Smyrna](/glossary/names#polycarp) (69–155 AD) had been a disciple of [St. John](/people/saints/apostles/john). Jerome wrote that John ordained him as Bishop of Smyrna (western Asia Minor). Polycarp is regarded as one of the [Apostolic Fathers](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers). The chief sources on the life of Polycarp are *The Martyrdom of Polycarp* (author unknown), St. Irenaeus' *Epistle to Florinus* and his *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="adversus-haereses" text="Adversus Haereses" />*, the epistles of St. Ignatius, and St. Polycarp's own letter to the Philippians. According to Irenaeus, Polycarp was a companion of [St. Papias](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers/papias-of-hierapolis), another "hearer of John", and a correspondent of St. Ignatius.

> "I could tell you the place where the blessed Polycarp sat to preach the Word of God. It is yet present to my mind with what gravity he everywhere came in and went out; what was the sanctity of his deportment, the majesty of his countenance; and what were his holy exhortations to the people. I seem to hear him now relate how he conversed with John and many others who had seen Jesus Christ, the words he had heard from their mouths."

Irenaeus heard the account of Polycarp's discussion with John and with others who had seen Jesus. He reports that Polycarp was converted to Christianity by apostles, was consecrated a presbyter, and communicated with many who had seen Jesus. He writes that he had had the good fortune, when young, to know Polycarp, who was then far advanced in years.

Irenaeus also wrote that Polycarp visited Anicetus of Rome to discuss differences in the practices of the churches of Asia and Rome. Irenaeus states that on certain things the two speedily came to an understanding, while as to the observance of Easter, each adhered to his own custom, without breaking off full communion with the other. Polycarp followed the Eastern practice of celebrating the feast on the 14th of Nisan, the day of the Jewish Passover, regardless of the day of the week on which it fell, while Anicetus followed the Western practice of celebrating the feast on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox. Anicetus allowed Polycarp to celebrate the Eucharist in his own church, which was regarded by the Romans as a great honor.

Polycarp was persecuted by the Romans at the age of 86. His friends and family urged him to flee, but Polycarp remained in his home. When the Roman soldiers arrived, he simply said, "God's will be done." Polycarp was led to a local arena and publicly questioned. Seeing that he was going to be put to death, Polycarp simply said, "Come, do what you will." He said that the Lord would give him strength to endure. He was then sentenced to be burned at the stake, but the fire, like the sail of a vessel filled by the wind, made a wall around his body, leaving it unscathed. Thus, the executioner was ordered to thrust him through.
