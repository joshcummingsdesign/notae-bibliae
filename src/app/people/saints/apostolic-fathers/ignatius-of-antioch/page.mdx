<Initial text="Ignatius of Antioch" />

[St. Ignatius of Antioch](/glossary/names#ignatius) (50–108 AD) was born in Roman Syria, and converted to Christianity at a young age. Tradition identifies him and his friend [St. Polycarp](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers/polycarp-of-smyrna) as disciples of [St. John](/people/saints/apostles/john). Later, Ignatius was chosen to serve as Bishop of Antioch. Theodoret of Cyrrhus (5th-century theologian of the School of Antioch) claimed that [St. Peter](/people/saints/apostles/peter) himself left directions that Ignatius be appointed to this episcopal see.

Ignatius was condemned to death for his faith, but instead of being executed in his home town of Antioch, the bishop was taken to Rome by a company of ten soldiers. During the journey to Rome, Ignatius and his entourage of soldiers made a number of lengthy stops in Asia Minor. During the journey, the soldiers seem to have allowed the chained Ignatius to meet with entire congregations of Christians, and numerous Christian visitors and messengers were allowed to meet with him individually. These messengers allowed Ignatius to send six letters to nearby churches (Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, and Smyrnaeans), and one to Polycarp.

Ignatius wrote that he would be thrown to the beasts, and [Eusebius](/people/scholars/eusebius) reports that he indeed was. [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) is the first to explicitly mention lions. [St. John Chrysostom](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-chrysostom) reports that Ignatius' martyrdom occurred at the Colosseum.

Ignatius' writings form a central part of a later collection of works by the [Apostolic Fathers](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers). He is considered one of the three most important of these, together with [St. Clement](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers/clement-of-rome) and St. Polycarp. His letters also serve as an example of early Christian theology, and address important topics including ecclesiology, the Sacraments, and the role of bishops. In Antioch, Ignatius' feast day was held on October 17, which is the day on which he is now celebrated in the Western Church.
