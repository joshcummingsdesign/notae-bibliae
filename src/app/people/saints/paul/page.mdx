[St. Paul](/glossary/names#paul), whose Hebrew name is [Saul](/glossary/names#saul), was a Jew from Tarsus (modern day Turkey) who descended from the line of Benjamin (Acts 9:11) (Phil. 3:5). He was a Roman citizen (Acts 22:27-28). He was also a Pharisee (Acts 23:6) who was persecuting disciples of Jesus (Acts 8:3). He was met by Jesus on the road to Damascus (Syria) (Acts 9:4-5) where he was struck blind (Acts 9:8).

Paul went to Damascus where he was commissioned by Jesus through the disciple Ananias to preach the gospel among the Gentiles (Acts 9:15), and where he regained his sight by the Holy Spirit (Acts 9:17). The church in Jerusalem sent [St. Barnabas](/people/saints/barnabas) to Antioch when Hellenists from Cyprus and Cyrene were receiving the gospel there, and a great many people were added to the Lord (Acts 11:20-24). He then found Paul in Tarsus and brought him to Antioch where they met with the church for a whole year and taught a great many people. There, the disciples were called Christians for the first time (Acts 11:25-26).

Paul and Barnabas brought a relief fund to Jerusalem during the famine (Acts 11:27-30), and went on the first mission through Asia Minor together (Acts 13:2). Paul and Barnabas were appointed to go to the Jerusalem Council to defend against the circumcision party (Acts 15:1-2). Eventually Paul and Barnabas parted ways over a disagreement about [St. Mark](/people/saints/mark), and Barnabas went to Cyprus.

Tradition holds that [St. Peter](/people/saints/peter) and St. Paul established a church in Rome.[^1] In around 48 AD, Paul wrote [Galatians](/bible/new-testament/epistles/galatians),[^2] and soon after began his second mission with [St. Silas](/people/saints/silas) (Acts 15:40-41). It was during this time that Paul wrote [1 Thessalonians](/bible/new-testament/epistles/1-thessalonians) and [2 Thessalonians](/bible/new-testament/epistles/2-thessalonians) from Corinth.[^3][^4]

In around 52 AD, Paul went to Galatia and Phrygia on his third mission (Acts 18:23).[^5] It was during this time that he wrote [1 Corinthians](/bible/new-testament/epistles/1-corinthians) from Ephesus,[^6] [2 Corinthians](/bible/new-testament/epistles/2-corinthians) from Macedonia,[^7] and [Romans](/bible/new-testament/epistles/romans) from Corinth.[^8]

In around 62 AD, Paul was imprisoned in Rome, where he wrote [Colossians](/bible/new-testament/epistles/colossians), [Philemon](/bible/new-testament/epistles/philemon), [Ephesians](/bible/new-testament/epistles/ephesians), and [Philippians](/bible/new-testament/epistles/philippians).[^9] He was released from prison and carried on further mission work. It was during this time that he wrote [1 Timothy](/bible/new-testament/epistles/1-timothy) and [Titus](/bible/new-testament/epistles/titus).[^10] Just a few years later, Roman Emperor Nero blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome, and started a brutal wave of persecutions.[^11] Both Peter and Paul were imprisoned in Rome and sentenced to death. It was during this time that Paul wrote [2 Timothy](/bible/new-testament/epistles/2-timothy).[^12]

In around 68 AD, Peter and Paul were martyred at the Circus of Nero in Rome.[^13] Tradition holds that Paul was beheaded.[^14]
