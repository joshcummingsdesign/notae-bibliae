<Initial text="Simon"/>

[St. Simon](/glossary/names#simeon) was the brother of [St. James the Less](/people/saints/james-the-less), [St. Jude](/people/saints/jude), and [St. Matthew](/people/saints/matthew). James the Less, Jude, Matthew, and Simon were sons of [Cleopas](/glossary/names#cleopas), one of the men who encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas was married to [St. Joseph's](/people/saints/joseph) sister Mary (John 19:25), which means that James the Less, Jude, Matthew, and Simon were Jesus' cousins (Matt. 9:9) (Mark 2:14) (Matt. 10:3) (Matt. 13:55).

Simon is also sometimes called "Simon the Zealot". A zealot was a political activist radically opposed to Roman rule. Simon was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:4).
