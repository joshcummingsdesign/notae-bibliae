[St. Peter's](/glossary/names#peter) name is [Simon](/glossary/names#simon). He was a fisherman from Bethsaida (north of the Sea of Galilee). His brother [Andrew](/people/saints/andrew) was a disciple of [St. John the Baptist](/people/saints/john-the-baptist) who began to follow Jesus when he heard John say that he was the "Lamb of God" (John 1:40). Andrew told Simon that Jesus is the Messiah, and brought him to see Jesus. Jesus then renamed him Peter (John 1:41-42).

When Peter's mother-in-law was sick with a fever, Jesus healed her (Matt. 8:14-15). He was also there with [James](/people/saints/james) and [John](/people/saints/john) when Jesus heals Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:37-39). Peter was one of the disciples who witnessed Jesus walking on water, and is even called out to the water with him (Matt. 14:28-30).

Peter famously confessed Jesus as the Son of God, and was given the keys to the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 16:16-19). When Jesus foretold his resurrection, Peter doubted and was rebuked (Matt. 16:21-23). He, along with James and John, witnessed the Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-2), where Peter offered to make three tents for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah (Matt. 17:3-4). Peter, along with James, John and Andrew, asked Jesus the signs of the end of the age on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3-4).

Peter and John were asked by Jesus to prepare the Passover (Luke 22:8). When Jesus washed the disciples' feet, Peter questioned why (John 13:6-8).

At the Passover, Jesus foretold his death, and Peter said he would never fall away (Matt. 26:31-33). Jesus then foretold that Peter would deny him three times (Matt. 26:33-34).

Peter and John were among the first to see the empty tomb (John 20:1-2), and after Mary Magdalene, he was one of the first to see the risen Jesus (Luke 24:34) (1 Cor. 15:3-5). Jesus called Peter to shepherd the disciples (John 21:16), and foretold his martyrdom (John 21:18-19).

Peter delivered his famous sermon at Pentecost (Acts 2:14), and is the author of two of the Epistles. He wrote 1 Peter in Rome in around 62–63 AD, and was imprisoned in Rome under the reign of Nero in around 64–68 AD. There, He wrote 2 Peter. Soon after, he was crucified. Tradition holds that he requested to be crucified head down, as he felt he was unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus.
