<Initial text="Jerome of Stridon"/>

[Eusebius](/glossary/names#eusebius) [Sophronius](/glossary/names#sophronius) [Hieronymus](/glossary/names#jerome), better known as [St. Jerome of Stridon](/glossary/names#jerome) (342–420 AD), was born in Stridon—a town in the Roman province of Dalmatia—which is either in modern Croatia or Slovenia, though the exact location is unknown. In the 360s, Jerome went to Rome with his friend Bonosus of Sardica to pursue rhetorical and philosophical studies. Although at first afraid of Christianity, he eventually converted, and it was there in Rome that Jerome was baptized. Jerome studied under the philologist (someone who studies the history of languages, especially by looking closely at literature) Aelius Donatus. There he learned Latin and at least some Koine Greek.

As a student, Jerome engaged in the superficial escapades and sexual experimentation of students in Rome; he indulged himself quite casually but he suffered terrible bouts of guilt afterwards. To appease his conscience, on Sundays he visited the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="sepulcrum" text="sepulchres" /> of the martyrs and the apostles in the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="catacumbae" text="catacombs" />. This experience reminded him of the terrors of hell.

Seized with a desire for a life of ascetic penance, Jerome went for a time to the desert of Chalcis, to the southeast of Antioch, known as the "Syrian Thebaid" from the number of eremites (hermits) inhabiting it. During this period, he seems to have found time for studying and writing. He made his first attempt to learn Hebrew under the guidance of a converted Jew; and he seems to have been in correspondence with Jewish Christians in Antioch. Around this time he had copied for himself a Hebrew Gospel, today as the Gospel of the Hebrews, which the Nazarenes (an early Jewish Christian sect) considered to be the true Gospel of Matthew. Fragments of this are preserved in Jerome's notes, and he translated parts of it into Greek.

In 382, Jerome returned to Rome, and [Pope St. Damasus I](/people/saints/latin-fathers/damasus-of-rome) appointed him as secretary and librarian. It was then that he was commissioned to begin a revision of the [Vetus Latina](/bible/translations/vetus-latina).

Jerome was surrounded by a circle of well-born and well-educated women, including some from the noblest patrician families. Among these women were such as the widows Lea, Marcella, and Paula, and Paula's daughters Blaesilla and Eustochium. It is estimated that 40% of Jerome's epistles were addressed to women. Some members of the clergy viewed it as inappropriate for a man, especially a cleric, to have such close correspondence with women. Additionally, his focus on women's spiritual lives and his encouragement for them to pursue asceticism put him at odds with the prevailing social norms, which often relegated women to less significant roles in religious life. The resulting inclination of these women towards the monastic life, away from the indulgent lasciviousness in Rome, and Jerome's unsparing criticism of the secular clergy of Rome, brought a growing hostility against him among the Roman clergy and their supporters. Soon after the death of Pope Damasus I in 384, Jerome was forced to leave his position at Rome after an inquiry was brought up by the Roman clergy into allegations that he had an improper relationship with the widow Paula. Still, his writings were highly regarded by women who were attempting to maintain vows of becoming consecrated virgins, and were widely read and distributed throughout the Christian empire.

Jerome knew some Hebrew when he started his translation project, but moved to Jerusalem to strengthen his grip on Jewish scripture commentary. Paula, funded Jerome's stay in a monastery in the nearby city of Bethlehem, where he settled next to the Church of the Nativity—built half a century prior on orders of Emperor Constantine over what was reputed to be the site of the Nativity of Jesus. By 390 he turned to translating the Hebrew Bible from the original Hebrew, having previously translated portions from the Septuagint which came from Alexandria. He did so against the advice of most other Christians, including [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo), who thought the Septuagint inspired. Jerome believed that the mainstream Rabbinical Judaism had rejected the Septuagint as invalid Jewish scriptural texts because of what were ascertained as mistranslations along with its Hellenistic heretical elements.

Jerome completed his translation work by 405, which later came to be known as the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate). For the next 15 years, until he died, Jerome produced a number of commentaries on Scripture, often explaining his translation choices in using the original Hebrew. His patristic commentaries align closely with Jewish tradition. Unlike his contemporaries, Jerome emphasized the difference between the Hebrew Bible "Apocrypha" and the protocanonical books. Jerome died on September 30, 420, and was buried under the Church of the Nativity.

Jerome's list of writings is extensive. In addition to his biblical works, he wrote polemical and historical essays, always from a theologian's perspective. In addition, his works are a crucial source of information on the pronunciation of the Hebrew language in Byzantine Palestine. Jerome is the second-most voluminous writer after Augustine in ancient Latin Christianity. The Council of Trent in 1546 declared the Vulgate authoritative. Jerome showed more zeal and interest in the ascetic ideal than in abstract speculation. He lived as an ascetic for 4-5 years in the Syrian desert, and later near Bethlehem for 34 years. His writings show outstanding scholarship and his correspondence has great historical importance. Due to his work, Jerome is recognized as a saint, and he was declared a Doctor of the Church by Pope Boniface VIII in 1298. He is one of the four original Doctors of the Latin Church, alongside [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan), St. Augustine, and [Pope St. Gregory I](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great).
