<Initial text="Hilary of Poitiers" />

Bishop and Doctor of the Church
<br/>c. 310–368 AD

## First Part

[St. Hilary](/glossary/names#hilary) was born at Poitiers in Gaul. His parents were pagans, and he was brought up in idolatry. He gives an account of his conversion to the faith of Christ in his book *On the Trinity*. He was married before his conversion; and his wife, by whom he had a daughter, named Apra, was yet living when he was chosen Bishop of Poitiers, about the year 353; but from the time of his ordination he lived [a celibate life]. It is probable that St. Hilary was elected Bishop from the rank of a layman, as was often the case in the early ages, and received all orders [in quick succession]. He soon became renowned in Gaul as a preacher; and [St. Martin](/people/saints/early/martin-of-tours), then a young man, was attracted by his name, and lived for a time at Poitiers as his disciple.

Immediately after the [Arian Council](/glossary/historical-terms#arianism) at Milan, in 355, which had condemned [St. Athanasius](/people/saints/greek-fathers/athanasius-of-alexandria), and had prevailed on the Emperor Constantius to banish all the Bishops who adhered to him, St. Hilary wrote to the Emperor, entreating him to stop the persecution, to recall the Catholic Bishops, and forbid secular judges to interfere in the affairs of the Church. This remonstrance had no effect; but he had the satisfaction of seeing the Gallican Bishops remain firm during those days of trial. [An Arian synod was held] at Beziers in Languedoc, at which Saturninus, [Bishop of Arles], presided. St. Hilary there made a noble confession of the [Nicene Faith](/glossary/historical-terms#council-of-nicaea), and refuted the heresy of Arius; but the party of Saturninus, reinforced by Bishops from the neighbouring countries, was too strong for him, and he was condemned and deposed; and immediately afterwards the Emperor Constantius banished him into Phrygia.

St. Hilary wrote his *History of Synods* in the end of 358. It contains an account of the various councils that had been assembled in the East on the subject of the Arian heresy, together with a defence of the Nicene Faith. It is addressed to the British Bishops among others, whom he congratulates on their steadfastness. The Saint also wrote his book *On the Trinity* during his exile, and a smaller treatise *Against the Arians*. He was also the undoubted author of several hymns, and others have been attributed to him.

## Second Part

[At the Council of Seleucia in 359], St. Hilary bore witness to the faith of the Western Church being the same as that declared to be the Catholic Faith at the Council of Nicaea. He accompanied the deputies of the council to Constantinople, in hopes of obtaining from the Emperor Constantius the recall of his sentence of banishment.

The Emperor refused to grant St. Hilary what he asked; but the Arians so much dreaded his presence in the East, that they persuaded Constantius to send him back to Gaul, yet without formally recalling the sentence of exile.

The joy of his return to his church and his native land was much lessened by the miserable confusion which he left behind him in the East. Still it must have been very great; and his approach was hailed with delight by the church in Gaul. St. Martin, who had been living in retirement in the island of Gallenari, off the city of Genoa, went to Rome to meet him; but finding that he had already left it, he followed him to Poitiers, and soon after built a monastery near the town. St. Hilary immediately applied himself to repair the mischief which [previous councils] had done: and a synod was assembled at Paris, which condemned [their] proceedings, and declared the true Faith of the consubstantiality of the Son of God.

[St. Hilary] finished his labours by a blessed death in January, 368 AD. A brilliant light is said to have filled the chamber where the body of the holy man was lying. [St. Gregory of Tours](/people/saints/medieval/gregory-of-tours) attests the truth of a miracle performed at his tomb; and others also are authenticated by various writers.[^1]
