<Initial text="Hilary of Poitiers"/>

[St. Hilary of Poitiers](/glossary/names#hilary) (310–367 AD) was born in Poitier (west-central France) in around 310 AD. He grew up in a pagan family, and received a good education which included a high level of Greek. He later studied the Old and New Testament writings which led to his conversion, and he and his wife and his daughter (Abra of Poitiers) were baptized. His fervent learning and his zeal for the faith attracted such attention that he was appointed Bishop of Poitiers in around 353 AD.

Arianism had made frightful ravages in various regions and threatened to invade Gaul (western Europe), where it already had numerous partisans affiliated with it. Hilary was formally opposed to the condemnation of Athanasius, strong supporter of the Nicene faith, by Pope Liberius at the Council of Arles (southern France) in 353 AD. In around 355 AD, Hilary wrote to Emperor Constantius II in a protest called *Ad Constantium Augustum liber primus* (Latin: "To Constantius Augustus the First Book") against the persecutions by which the Arians had sought to crush their opponents. In 356 AD, Saturninus, Bishop of Arles, convened and presided over a council at Béziers (southern France) with the intention opposing Trinitarianism. There, Hilary courageously defended the Nicene faith, but the council, composed for the most part of Arians, refused to hear him, and soon after he was exiled to Phrygia (central Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey).

While in exile, Hilary continued to govern his diocese, and wrote two of his most famous theological works: *De synodis* (Latin: "On the Councils"), an epistle addressed in 358 AD to the Semi-Arian bishops in Gaul, Germania and Britain, analyzing the views of the Eastern bishops on the Nicene controversy, and *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="de-trinitate" text="De trinitate"/>*, the first successful attempt to express in Latin the understanding of the Trinity as promulgated at the Council of Nicea, which consisted of twelve books. In around 360 AD, Hilary wrote *In Constantium* (Latin: "In the Land of Constantius") in which he rebuked Emperor Constantius as a great persecutor of orthodox Christians.

Hilary's urgent and repeated requests for public debates with his opponents, especially with Arian bishops Ursacius and Valens, proved at last so inconvenient that he was sent back to his diocese, which he appears to have reached about 361 AD.

According to [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon), Hilary died in Poitiers in 367 AD. [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) called him "the illustrious doctor of the churches". He is sometimes referred to as the "Hammer of the Arians" and the "Athanasius of the West". Hilary was named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius IX. His daughter, Abra of Poitiers, was a nun and saint who became known for her charity.
