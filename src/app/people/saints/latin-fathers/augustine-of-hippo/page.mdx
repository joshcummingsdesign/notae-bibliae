<Initial text="Augustine of Hippo" />

[St. Augustine of Hippo](/glossary/names#augustine) (354–430 AD) was born in Thagaste (a Roman-Berber city in North Africa in modern Algeria, now called Souk Ahras) in the Roman province of Numidia. His mother, Monica, was a devout Christian, and his father Patricius was a pagan who converted to Christianity on his deathbed. He had a brother named Navigius and a sister whose name is lost but is conventionally remembered as Perpetua. Scholars generally agree that Augustine and his family were Berbers, an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa, but were heavily Romanized, speaking only Latin at home as a matter of pride and dignity.

At the age of 11, Augustine was sent to school at Madaurus (now M'Daourouch), a small Numidian city about 19 miles south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with Latin literature, as well as pagan beliefs and practices. His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole pears from a neighborhood garden. He tells this in his *Confessions* (Latin: "Confessiones"), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of autobiography. Augustine realized that the pears were "tempting neither for its color nor its flavor", he was neither hungry nor poor, and he had enough of fruit which were "much better". Over the next few chapters, Augustine agonizes over this past sin of his, recognizing that one does not desire evil for evil's sake. Rather, "through an inordinate preference for these goods of a lower kind, the better and higher are neglected". In other words, man is drawn to sin when grossly choosing the lesser good over a greater good.

At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus, Augustine went to Carthage (an ancient Roman city in Northern Africa, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now Tunisia) to continue his education in rhetoric, though it was above the financial means of his family. Despite the good warnings of his mother, as a youth Augustine lived a hedonistic lifestyle for a time, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits. The need to gain their acceptance encouraged inexperienced boys like Augustine to seek or make up stories about sexual experiences.

It was while he was a student in Carthage that he read Cicero's dialogue *Hortensius* (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression, enkindling in his heart the love of wisdom and a great thirst for truth. It started his interest in philosophy. Although raised Christian, Augustine became a Manichaean (a religion that teaches an elaborate dualistic cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness), much to his mother's chagrin.

At about the age of 17, Augustine began a relationship with a young woman in Carthage. Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover. He was warned by his mother to avoid fornication (sex outside marriage), but Augustine persisted in the relationship for over fifteen years, and the woman gave birth to his son Adeodatus, which means "Gift from God", who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries.

Augustine was, from the beginning, a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek. His first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. He did, however, become a master of Latin.

Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste from 373–374 AD. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and remained there for the next nine years. Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, in 383 AD he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay.

Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, Symmachus, who had been asked by the imperial court at Milan to provide a rhetoric professor. Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384 AD. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers.

Although Augustine spent ten years as a Manichaean, he was never an initiate or "elect", but an "auditor", the lowest level in this religion's hierarchy. While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean bishop, Faustus of Mileve, a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism. In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the scepticism of the New Academy movement (a Platonic movement which denied the possibility of knowing an absolute truth).

Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths. During his time in Milan, his mother's faith, his studies in Neoplatonism, and conversations with his friend Simplicianus all urged him towards Christianity. This was shortly after the Roman emperor Theodosius I declared Christianity to be the only legitimate religion for the Roman Empire on February 27, 380 AD by the Edict of Thessalonica, and then issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 AD. Initially, Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan), Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed.

Augustine visited Ambrose in Milan, having heard of his reputation as an orator. Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced. Soon, their relationship grew, as Augustine wrote, "And I began to love him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church—but as a friendly man." Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired. In his *Confessions*, Augustine states, "That man of God received me as a father would, and welcomed my coming as a good bishop should." Ambrose adopted Augustine as a spiritual son after the death of Augustine's father.

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a marriage for him with a teenage heiress. In 385 AD, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare for the marriage. Augustine was deeply distraught over the matter. He wrote, "My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding." Augustine confessed he had not been a lover of wedlock so much as a slave of lust, so he procured a concubine since he had to wait two years until his fiancée came of age. However, his emotional wound was not healed. It was during this period that he uttered his famously insincere prayer, "Grant me chastity and continence, but not yet." Augustine eventually broke off his engagement and his relationship with his concubine.

In around 386 AD, Augustine heard a child's voice say "take up and read" (Latin: *tolle, lege*), and this prompted him to begin to read biblical texts at random as a method of divination—*Sortes biblicae* (Latin: "biblical lots")—a practice with pagan roots which was later condemned by the Church. Augustine opened to Romans 13:13–14, "Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires." Ponticianus, a high imperial official and a baptized Christian believer, was surprised one day to find Augustine and his friend Alypius reading the letters of Paul. As they talked, Ponticianius told them about [St. Anthony](/people/saints/desert-fathers/anthony-the-great) and his extraordinary life, and discovered with astonishment that Augustine and Alypius had never heard of Anthony nor "the flocks in the monasteries and their manner of life well pleasing to God and the fertile deserts of the wilderness." As Ponticianus spoke, Augustine was "violently overcome by a fearful sense of shame." The intellectual arguments that might have kept him from following these humbling examples had all been exhausted, and in August, at the age of 31, Augustine converted to Christianity. He later wrote an account of his conversion in his *Confessions*.

> "Belatedly I loved thee, O Beauty so ancient and so new, belatedly I loved thee. For see, thou wast within and I was without, and I sought thee out there. Unlovely, I rushed heedlessly among the lovely things thou hast made. Thou wast with me, but I was not with thee. These things kept me far from thee; even though they were not at all unless they were in thee. Thou didst call and cry aloud, and didst force open my deafness. Thou didst gleam and shine, and didst chase away my blindness. Thou didst breathe fragrant odours and I drew in my breath; and now I pant for thee. I tasted, and now I hunger and thirst. Thou didst touch me, and I burned for thy peace."

Ambrose baptized Augustine and his son Adeodatus in Milan on Easter Vigil, April 24-25, 387 AD. A year later, in 388 AD, Augustine completed his apology *On the Holiness of the Catholic Church*. That year, also, Adeodatus and Augustine returned home to Africa. Augustine's mother Monica died at Ostia, Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa. Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine's family's property. Soon after, Adeodatus, too, died. Augustine then sold his patrimony and gave the money to the poor. He only kept the family house, which he converted into a monastic foundation for himself and a group of friends.

After converting to Christianity, Augustine turned against his profession as a rhetoric professor in order to devote more time to preaching. While he was known for his major contributions to Christian rhetoric, another major contribution was his preaching style. In 391 AD, Augustine was ordained a priest in Hippo Regius (modern Annaba, Algeria). He was especially interested in discovering how his previous rhetorical training in Italian schools would help the Christian Church achieve its objective of discovering and teaching the different scriptures in the Bible. He was also noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered. He preached around 6,000 to 10,000 sermons in his lifetime. When Augustine preached his sermons, they were recorded by stenographers. About 500 of his sermons have been preserved to this day. Some of his sermons would last over one hour, and he would preach multiple times throughout a given week. When preaching, he would stand on an elevated platform and would sometimes walk towards the audience during his sermons. When he was preaching, he used a variety of rhetorical devices that included analogies, word pictures, similes, metaphors, repetition, and antithesis when trying to explain more about the Bible. In addition, he used questions and rhymes when talking about the differences between people's life on earth and heaven. Augustine believed that the preachers' ultimate goal is to ensure the salvation of their audience.

In 395 AD, he was made Coadjutor Bishop of Hippo, and became full bishop shortly thereafter. He gave his property to the church of Thagaste. One of his goals as bishop was to minister to individuals in his congregation, and another was to interpret the work of the Bible. He would choose the passages that the church planned to read every week.

Augustine wrote his *Confessions* in 397–398 AD. This work is an outpouring of thanksgiving and penitence. Although it is written as an account of his life, the *Confessions* also talks about the nature of time, causality, free will, and other important philosophical topics.

Augustine worked tirelessly to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity, and even invited his priests to share a community life with him. Augustine followed the monastic or religious life as it was known to his contemporaries, drafting rules for the monks and nuns of Roman Africa. Like [St. Basil the Great](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/basil-the-great), Augustine's view diverged from that of the earlier eremitical approach of strict physical austerities. In *The Ways of the Catholic Church*, Augustine observed contemporary criticisms of the methods of the Eastern hermits in the Egyptian desert. It was said that their extreme isolation and excessive asceticism "were no longer productive" for the church or society. In response to this, Augustine promoted poverty of spirit and continence of the heart while living in the milieu of a town such as Hippo.

In Hippo, the members of Augustine's monastic house lived in community while yet keeping to their pastoral obligations. For Augustine, the love of neighbor was simply another expression of the love of God. He saw the call to service in the church as a necessity to be heeded, even if it compromised a personal desire for contemplation and study. One of the elements of communal living was simplicity of lifestyle. Regarding the use of property or possessions, Augustine did not make a virtue of poverty, but of sharing. Augustine wrote frequently on prayer, but prescribed no specific method, system, or posture; although he highly endorsed the Psalms. *The Rule of Saint Augustine*, written in about the year 400 AD, is a brief document divided into eight chapters and serves as an outline for religious life lived in community. It is the oldest monastic rule in the Western Church.

The sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 AD led many Romans to believe that the decline of their empire was due to the abandonment of their traditional pagan gods in favor of Christianity. In response to this, Augustine wrote one of his most influential works: *The City of God*. In *The City of God*, Augustine contrasts two symbolic cities: the City of God and the City of Man (or Earthly City). The City of God represents those who live according to God's will, with eternal destiny in heaven. The City of Man represents those who live according to worldly desires and self-love, destined for destruction. *The City of God* is a cornerstone of Western thought, expounding on many questions of theology, such as the suffering of the righteous, the existence of evil, the conflict between free will and divine omniscience, and the doctrine of original sin.

Augustine's *On the Trinity*, published in around 417 AD, is also considered to be among his masterpieces. In it, Augustine sought to defend the orthodox understanding of the Trinity, and to provide a clearer and more precise explanation. In *On the Trinity*, Augustine developes what has become known as the "psychological analogy" of the Trinity. Augustine is careful to note that this analogy is not perfect, and that the divine Trinity is far more mysterious and profound than any human analogy can fully capture. In an apocryphal letter of Augustine to [St. Cyril of Jerusalem](/people/saints/greek-fathers/cyril-of-jerusalem), Augustine referred to having seen a child who was trying to pour the seawater in a hole with a seashell. After having explained to the child that it was impossible, the child replied in Latin to Augustine, "Augustine, Augustine, what are you trying to do? Do you believe to be able to pour the whole sea in a little jar?" Then the child disappeared from his sight. The anecdote teaches the impossibility for the finite human mind to fully comprehend the infinitely-complex mystery of the Most Holy Trinity.

Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles. They include apologetic works against the heresies of the Arians, Donatists, Manichaeans, and Pelagians; texts on Christian doctrine, notably *De Doctrina Christiana* (Latin: "On Christian Doctrine"); exegetical works such as commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms, and Paul's Letter to the Romans; theological works such as *De libero arbitrio* (Latin: "On Free Choice of the Will"), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil; many sermons and letters; and the *Retractationes* (Latin: "Reconsiderations"), a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.

In the spring of 430 AD, the Vandals invaded Roman Africa and besieged Hippo. Around this time, Augustine entered his final illness. Augustine has been cited to have excommunicated himself upon the approach of his death in an act of public penance and solidarity with sinners. Spending his final days in prayer and repentance, he requested the penitential Psalms of David be hung on his walls. He directed the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein be carefully preserved. He died on August 28, 430 AD. Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned soon after and burned the city. They destroyed all but Augustine's cathedral and library, which they left untouched.

Augustine's writings influenced the development of Western philosophy and Western Christianity, and he is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers of the Latin Church in the Patristic Period. According to his contemporary, [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon), Augustine "established anew the ancient Faith." Believing the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom, he helped expound upon the doctrine of original sin and made significant contributions to the development of just war theory. [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas) was influenced heavily by Augustine. [*The Rule of Saint Benedict*](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) shows influence by *The Rule of Saint Augustine*. Many Protestants, especially Calvinists and Lutherans, consider him one of the theological fathers of the Protestant Reformation due to his teachings on salvation and divine grace. Protestant Reformers generally, and Martin Luther in particular, held Augustine in preeminence among early Church Fathers. From 1505 to 1521, Luther was a member of the Order of the Augustinian Eremites.

Augustine was canonized by popular acclaim, and later recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by Pope Boniface VIII. He is one of the four original Doctors of the Latin Church, alongside St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, and [Pope St. Gregory the Great](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great).
