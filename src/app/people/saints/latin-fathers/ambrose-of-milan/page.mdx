<Initial text="Ambrose of Milan" />

[St. Ambrose of Milan](/glossary/names#ambrose) (339–397 AD) was born in Augusta Treverorum (modern Trier in eastern Germany) and raised in a Roman Christian family. He was the youngest of three children (both his brother Satyrus and his sister Marcellina were later venerated as saints). His father was a statesman, and his mother was a woman of intellect and piety. After the death of his father, his family moved to Rome. There, Ambrose studied literature, law, and rhetoric. He then followed in his father's footsteps and entered public service, first as a judicial councilman, and then as the governor of Liguria and Emilia, with headquarters in Milan (northern Italy).

In 374 AD the Bishop of Milan, Auxentius, an Arian, died, and the Arians challenged the succession. Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place to prevent an uproar which seemed probable in this crisis. His address was interrupted by a call, "Ambrose, bishop!", which was taken up by the whole assembly. Ambrose, though known to be a Nicene Christian, was considered acceptable to the Arians due his great charity toward them.

At first, Ambrose refused the office of bishop, as he felt he was in no way prepared. Ambrose was a relatively new Christian who was not yet baptized nor formally trained in theology. Ambrose fled to a colleague's home, seeking to hide. Upon receiving a letter from Emperor Gratian praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals worthy of holy positions, Ambrose's host gave him up. Within a week, he was baptized, ordained, and duly consecrated as the new Bishop of Milan. This was the first time in the West that a member of the upper class of high officials had accepted the office of bishop.

As bishop, Ambrose immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle. After making provision for his sister Marcellina, he apportioned his money to the poor and donated all of his land. Ambrose's popularity with the people made him extremely effective as bishop.

Ambrose spent much of his career fighting Arianism (the belief that Christ was not truly divine, but a created being). Ambrose believed unity in the church was crucial for both the Church and the Roman Empire. His leadership helped shape orthodox Christianity during a time of major religious and political challenges.

In the late 380s, Empress Justina (wife of Emperor Valentinian II) tried to assert her authority by attempting to turn the Portian Basilica in Rome over to the Arians. In response, Ambrose filled the church with Nicene Christians, and kept them there night and day until the peril was past. During this time, Ambrose—drawing inspiration from the Eastern Church—arranged psalms for the congregation to sing, thus bringing antiphons, hymns, and vigils into the practice of the Western Church.

Ambrose left a substantial collection of writings, of which the best known include the ethical commentary *De officiis ministrorum* (Latin: "On the Duties of the Clergy"), and the exegetical *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="hexaemeron" text="Hexaemeron" />*. Ambrose also wrote many hymns, including the well-known "[Come, Thou Redeemer of the Earth](/liturgy/hymns/come-thou-redeemer-of-the-earth)" (Latin: *Veni redemptor gentium*).

Ambrose's influence on the Church was profound, and he inspired many notable Christians, including [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo), whom he helped convert to Christianity. About Ambrose, Augustine said, "That man of God received me as a father would, and welcomed my coming as a good bishop should." Ambrose's preaching, actions, and literary and musical works made him one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century.

Ambrose died on Good Friday, April 4, 397 AD, and was soon after venerated as a saint. He was recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by Pope Boniface VIII. He is one of the four original Doctors of the Latin Church, alongside St. Augustine, [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon), and [Pope St. Gregory I](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great). He is commemorated on December 7, the anniversary of his consecration as bishop.
