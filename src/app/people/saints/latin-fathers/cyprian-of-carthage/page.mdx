<Initial text="Cyprian of Carthage" />

[St. Cyprian of Carthage](/glossary/names#cyprian) (210–258 AD) was born in Cathage (an ancient Roman city in Northern Africa, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now Tunisia) into a wealthy pagan family. He was a leading member of a legal fraternity in Carthage, an orator, a pleader in the courts, and a teacher of rhetoric. After a dissipated youth, Cyprian was baptized when he was thirty-five years old.

> "When I was still lying in darkness and gloomy night, I used to regard it as extremely difficult and demanding to do what God's mercy was suggesting to me…I myself was held in bonds by the innumerable errors of my previous life, from which I did not believe I could possibly be delivered, so I was disposed to acquiesce in my clinging vices and to indulge my sins…But after that, with the help of the water of new birth, the stain of my former life was washed away, and a light from above, serene and pure, was infused into my reconciled heart…a second birth restored me to a new man. Then, in a wondrous manner, every doubt began to fade…I clearly understood that what had first lived within me, enslaved by the vices of the flesh, was earthly and that what, instead, the Holy Spirit had wrought within me was divine and heavenly."

After his baptism, Cyprian gave away a portion of his wealth to the poor of Carthage. Soon after he was appointed as a deacon, and later a priest. In around 249 AD, he was chosen as the Bishop of Carthage, a popular decision among the poorer members of the community who appreciated his charitable acts and dignified manner. However, his quick ascent in the church hierarchy was not well-received by some senior clergy in Carthage, and this opposition persisted throughout his time as bishop.

In early 250 AD, the Decian persecution began. Emperor Decius issued an edict ordering sacrifices to the gods to be made throughout the Empire. Jews were specifically exempted from that requirement. Cyprian chose to go into hiding, rather than face potential execution. While some clergy saw that decision as a sign of cowardice, Cyprian defended himself by saying that he had fled in order not to leave the faithful without a shepherd during the persecution and that his decision to continue to lead them, although from a distance, was in accordance with divine will. Moreover, he pointed to the actions of the apostles and Jesus himself.

> "And therefore the Lord commanded us in the persecution to depart and to flee; and both taught that this should be done, and himself did it. For as the crown is given by the condescension of God, and cannot be received unless the hour comes for accepting it, whoever abiding in Christ departs for a while does not deny his faith, but waits for the time…"

The persecution was especially severe at Carthage. Many Christians fell away and were thereafter referred to as the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="lapsi" text="lapsi" />*. The majority of the lapsi had obtained signed statements certifying that they had sacrificed to the Roman gods to avoid persecution or confiscation of property. Cyprian found those who obtained these certificates cowardly and demanded that they undergo public penance before being readmitted to the church.

However, in Cyprian's absence, some priests disregarded his wishes by readmitting the lapsed to communion with little or no public penance. This group became known as the laxist party—a prominent figure being Novatus of Carthage. Others would not allow any of those who had lapsed to be reconciled. This group became known as the rigorist party—a prominent figure being Novatian of Rome.

Some of the lapsi presented a second statement purported to bear the signature of some martyr or confessor who, it was held, had the spiritual prestige to reaffirm individual Christians. This constituted a challenge to institutional authority in the church, in particular to that of the bishop. Hundreds or even thousands of lapsi were readmitted that way against the express wishes of Cyprian and the majority of the Carthaginian clergy, who insisted upon earnest repentance.

A schism then broke out in Carthage, as the laxist party, led largely by the priests who had opposed Cyprian's election, attempted to block measures taken by him during his period of absence. After fourteen months, Cyprian returned to the diocese and in letters addressed to the other North African bishops defended having left his post. After issuing a tract, *De lapsis* (Latin: "On the Fallen"), he convoked a council of North African bishops at Carthage to consider the treatment of the lapsi. Cyprian took a middle course between the laxist party and the rigorist party. The majority of the council sided with Cyprian.

The schism continued as the laxists elected Fortunatus, a bishop in opposition to Cyprian. At the same time, the rigorist party elected Novatian as Bishop of Rome in opposition to Pope Cornelius. The Novatianists also elected Maximus, a rival bishop of their own at Carthage. Cyprian now found himself wedged between laxists and rigorists, but the polarization highlighted the firm but moderate position adopted by Cyprian, and strengthened his influence by wearing down the numbers of his opponents. Moreover, his dedication during the time of a great plague and famine gained him still further popular support.

Cyprian comforted his brethren by writing his *De mortalitate* (Latin: "On Mortality"), and in his *De eleemosynis* (Latin: "On Alms"), he exhorted them to active charity towards the poor and set a personal example. He defended Christianity in his apology *Ad Demetrianum* (Latin: "On Demetrius"), and countered pagan claims that Christians were the cause of the public calamities.

In late 256 AD, a new persecution of the Christians broke out under Emperor Valerian, and Pope Sixtus II was executed in Rome. In Africa, Cyprian prepared his people for the expected edict of persecution by his *De exhortatione martyrii* (Latin: "On the Exhortation of Martyrdom"), and set an example when he was brought before the Roman proconsul Aspasius Paternus. He refused to sacrifice to the pagan deities and firmly professed Christ. The proconsul banished him to Curubis (modern Korba, Tunisia) where, to the best of his ability, he comforted his flock and his banished clergy.

A year later he was brought back and put on house arrest in expectation of severe measures after a new and more stringent imperial edict arrived. In a vision, Cyprian believed he saw his approaching fate. On September 13, 258 AD, Cyprian was imprisoned on the orders of the new proconsul, Galerius Maximus; and the following day he was sentenced to death.

> Galerius: "Are you Thascius Cyprianus?"
> Cyprian: "I am."
> Galerius: "The most sacred Emperors have commanded you to conform to the Roman rites."
> Cyprian: "I refuse."
> Galerius: "Take heed for yourself."
> Cyprian: "Do as you are bid; in so clear a case I may not take heed."
> Galerius: "You have long lived an irreligious life, and have drawn together a number of men bound by an unlawful association, and professed yourself an open enemy to the gods and the religion of Rome; and the pious, most sacred and august Emperors…have endeavored in vain to bring you back to conformity with their religious observances; whereas therefore you have been apprehended as principal and ringleader in these infamous crimes, you shall be made an example to those whom you have wickedly associated with you; the authority of law shall be ratified in your blood…It is the sentence of this court that Cyprianus be executed with the sword."
> Cyprian: "Thanks be to God."

The execution was carried out at once in an open place near the city. A vast multitude followed Cyprian on his last journey. He removed his garments without assistance, knelt down, and prayed. After he blindfolded himself, he was beheaded by the sword. His body was buried by Christians near the place of execution. Cyprian's martyrdom was followed by the martyrdom of eight of his disciples in Carthage.

Soon after his death, Cyprian was venerated as saint. Churches were erected over his tomb and over the place of his death. In later centuries, however, these churches were destroyed by the Vandals. The graves of such saints as Cyprian and Martin of Tours came to be regarded as "contact points between heaven and earth", and they became the centers of new, redefined, Christian urban communities. A surviving homily from [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) on Cyprian's feast day indicates that his following was fairly widespread throughout Africa by the fourth century.

Cyprian's skillful Latin rhetoric led to his being considered the pre-eminent Latin writer of Western Christianity until [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) and Augustine. Because the date of his death, September 14, is occupied by the Feast of the Cross, and the day after is occupied by the Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows, the Western Church commemorates him on September 16.
