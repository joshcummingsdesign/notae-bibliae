<Initial text="Leo the Great"/>

[Pope St. Leo I](/glossary/names#leo) (400–461 AD) was a native of Tuscany. By 431, as a deacon, he was well known outside of Rome. [St. John Cassian](/people/saints/early/john-cassian), for example, dedicated to him the treatise against Nestorius written at Leo's suggestion. There was also much confidence placed in him by the Imperial Court. Near the end of the reign of Pope Sixtus III, Leo was dispatched at the request of Emperor Valentinian III to settle a dispute between Aëtius, one of Gaul's chief military commanders, and the chief magistrate Albinus. During Leo's absence in Gaul, Pope Sixtus III died on August 11, 440, and on September 29, Leo was unanimously elected by the people to succeed him.

Leo was instrumental in renouncing various heresies that had crept into the church during his time, such as Pelagianism (humans can achieve salvation and moral perfection through their own free will and efforts), Manichaeism (a dualistic religion which blends together other religions), and Priscillianism (an ascetic form of Gnosticism). From a pastoral perspective, he energized charitable works in a Rome beset by famines, an influx of refugees, and poverty. He further associated the practice of fasting with charity and almsgiving.

Leo assumed the papacy at a time of increasing barbarian invasions; this, coupled with the decreasing imperial authority in the West, forced the Bishop of Rome to take a more active part in civil and political affairs. He was one of the first bishops of Rome to promote papal primacy based on succession from Peter the Apostle; and he did so as a means of maintaining unity among the churches. It was during Leo's papacy that the term "Pope", which previously meant any bishop, came to exclusively mean the Bishop of Rome. Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II, in a letter to Pope Leo I, was the first to call the Bishop of Rome the Patriarch of the West, a title that would continue to be used by the popes until the present day.

Around two years after [St. Cyril of Alexandria's](/people/saints/greek-fathers/cyril-of-alexandria) death in 444, a presbyter named Eutyches from Constantinople began teaching a variation of traditional Christology to combat what he saw as a resurgence of Nestorianism (Christ was a union of two distinct persons—one divine and one human—rather than a single person with two natures). Eutyches taught that after the Incarnation, Christ had only one nature, which was primarily divine. He argued that the human nature of Christ was absorbed or subsumed into his divine nature, resulting in a single, unified nature. Initially, Leo viewed Eutyches' stance as more of a theological error than deliberate heresy. In 448, however, Flavian, the Bishop of Constantinople, held a synod addressing accusations of heresy brought against Eutyches. Eutyches was summoned but failed to clearly defend his views, leading to his condemnation and exile. Flavian reported the matter to Leo, who responded with a detailed theological explanation supporting the synod's decision.

At the Second Council of Ephesus (western Asia Minor) in 449, Leo's representatives delivered his famous *<Definition lang="english" anchor="tome" text="Tome"/>*, a statement of the faith of the Roman Church in the form of a letter addressed to Flavian, which repeats, in close adherence to [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo), the formulas of western Christology.

In 450, Emperor Theodosius II died, and Emperor Marcian ascended the throne. The conflict surrounding the two natures of Christ continued on, so Leo requested that the emperor convene an ecumenical council in Italy. Emperor Marcian instead called for the council to convene at Chalcedon (a district in modern Istanbul, Turkey), because it was closer to Constantinople, and would thus allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube, which was being raided by Attila the Hun. In 451, The Council of Chalcedon was held, which rejected the heresy of Eutyches who denied the true human nature of the Son of God, and affirmed the union in his one Person, without confusion and without separation of his two natures, human and divine.

Attila the Hun invaded Italy in 452, sacking cities like Aquileia and heading toward Rome. He demanded the sister of Emperor Valentinian III be sent to him, but the emperor sent three envoys, including Pope Leo, to negotiate. While the exact details of the negotiations are unclear, Attila withdrew, with some historians attributing his retreat to Leo's persuasive actions.

Almost 100 sermons and 150 letters of Leo the Great have been preserved. His writings focus primarily on Christology and Soteriology. He emphasizes the true divinity and humanity of Christ, defending this balance against heretical views. In his In *Nativitate Domini*, Christmas Day, sermon, "Christian, remember your dignity", Leo articulates a fundamental dignity common to all Christians, saint and sinner alike.

> "Our Saviour, dearly-beloved, was born today: let us be glad. For there is no proper place for sadness, when we keep the birthday of the Life, which destroys the fear of mortality and brings to us the joy of promised eternity. No one is kept from sharing in this happiness. There is for all one common measure of joy, because as our Lord the destroyer of sin and death finds none free from charge, so is He come to free us all. Let the saint exult in that he draws near to victory. Let the sinner be glad in that he is invited to pardon. Let the gentile take courage in that he is called to life…Let us put off then the old man with his deeds: and having obtained a share in the birth of Christ let us renounce the works of the flesh. Christian, acknowledge thy dignity, and becoming a partner in the Divine nature, refuse to return to the old baseness by degenerate conduct. Remember the Head and the Body of which thou art a member. Recollect that thou wert rescued from the power of darkness and brought out into God's light and kingdom. By the mystery of Baptism thou wert made the temple of the Holy Ghost: do not put such a denizen to flight from thee by base acts, and subject thyself once more to the devil's thralldom: because thy purchase money is the blood of Christ, because He shall judge thee in truth Who ransomed thee in mercy, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit reigns for ever and ever. Amen."

Leo died on November 10, 461 and, as he wished to be buried as close as possible to the tomb of St. Peter, his body was entombed within the portico of Old St. Peter's Basilica. He was the first pope to be buried within St. Peter's. Pope Benedict XVI said that Leo's papacy was "undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church's history." In 1754, Pope Benedict XIV proclaimed Leo the Great a Doctor of the Church. Next to Leo only one other pope, [Pope St. Gregory I](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great), is also recognized as Doctor of the Church.
