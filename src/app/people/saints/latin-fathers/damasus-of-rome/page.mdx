<Initial text="Damasus of Rome"/>

[Pope St. Damasus I](/glossary/names#damasus) (305–384 AD) moved to Rome at a young age with his parents. His father Antonius and his mother Laurentia originally came from the region of Lusitania (modern Portugal). His father became a priest at the Church of St. Lawrence (San Lorenzo). There Damasus began his ecclesiastical career as a deacon, and later went on to serve as a priest.

Damasus was archdeacon of the Roman church when Pope Liberius was banished by Emperor Constantius II to Berea (northern Greece) in 354. Damasus followed Liberius into exile, though he immediately returned to Rome. During the time of Liberius' absence, Damasus played a significant role in overseeing the affairs of the Church.

In the early Church, bishops were customarily elected by the clergy and the people of the diocese. While this simple method worked well in a small community of Christians unified by persecution, as the congregation grew in size, the acclamation of a new bishop was fraught with division, rival claimants, and class hostility. At the same time, 4th-century emperors expected each new pope-elect to be presented to them for approval, which sometimes led to state domination of the Church's internal affairs.

After Pope Liberius' death in 366, a new pope was to be elected. The laity and deacons supported Ursinus—Liberius' deacon, who according to [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan) was of the Arian party in Milan—while the upper-class supporters of Felix, who governed during Liberius' exile, favored Damasus. The two were elected simultaneously, which sparked an intense conflict that led to a violent uprising by Damasus and his supporters. The city prefects intervened to restore order, though this led to further turmoil, including the exile of Ursinus.

Damasus was active in defending the Catholic Church against the threat of schisms. During the Arian controversy in Antioch, Damasus—together with [St. Athanasius](/people/saints/greek-fathers/athanasius-of-alexandria), and his successor, Peter II of Alexandria—favored Paulinus over Meletius for bishop, as they believed Paulinus held a view that more closely held to Nicene orthodoxy. Peter II sought refuge in Rome from the persecuting Arians. He was received by Damasus, who supported him against the Arians. In two Roman synods (368 and 369) he condemned Apollinarianism (Christ is fully God, but not fully man) and Macedonianism (the Holy Spirit is not fully God, but a ministering angel), and sent legates to the First Council of Constantinople that was convoked in 381 to address these heresies.

Damasus supported the appeal of the Christian senators to Emperor Gratian for the removal of the altar of Victory from the Senate House, and lived to welcome the famous edict of Theodosius I, "*De fide Catholica*" (Latin: "On the Catholic Faith"), on February 27, 380, which proclaimed as the religion of the Roman State that doctrine which Peter had preached to the Romans.

Damasus presided over the Council of Rome of 382, which determined the canon or official list of Sacred Scripture. The apocrypha was added later to this list in the 5th century under the leadership of Pope Gelasius I. This list is identical with the one presented in the 16th century at the Council of Trent.

Pope Damasus appointed [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) as secretary and librarian. In order to put an end to the marked divergences in the western texts of that period, Damasus commissioned Jerome to revise the [Vetus Latina](/bible/translations/vetus-latina). Jerome completed his translation work by 405, which later came to be known as the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate).

Pope Damasus played a key role in promoting the veneration of Christian martyrs, restoring access to their tombs in the Catacombs of Rome and other locations. He also undertook the restoration of his father's church, the Church of St. Lawrence (San Lorenzo), which by the 7th century had become an important stop on pilgrimages to the graves of Roman martyrs.

Damasus died on December 11, 384, and he is commemorated on the anniversary of his death.
