<Initial text="Isidore of Seville" />

[St. Isidore of Seville](/glossary/names#isidore) (560–636 AD) was born in Cartagena (southeastern Spain) to Hispano-Roman parents of high social rank. He and his family were instrumental in the conversion of Visigothic kings from Arianism to Chalcedonian Christianity. His older brother, Leander of Seville, immediately preceded Isidore as Archbishop of Seville (southwestern Spain) and, while in office, opposed King Liuvigild. His younger brother, Fulgentius of Cartagena, served as the Bishop of Astigi (modern day Écija in Seville) at the start of the new reign of the Christian King Reccared. His sister, Florentina of Cartagena, was a nun who oversaw many convents.

Isidore received his elementary education in the Cathedral school of Seville. The institution, the first of its kind in Spain, included many influential teachers such as his brother Leander. Isidore applied himself to study diligently enough that he quickly mastered classical Latin, and acquired some Greek and Hebrew. Two centuries of Gothic control of Spain incrementally suppressed such institutions, and Arianism took deep root among the Visigoths as the form of Christianity that they received.

After the death of his brother Leander around 601 AD, Isidore succeeded to the See of Seville. On his elevation to the episcopate, he immediately constituted himself as the protector of monks. During his time as archbishop, Isidore successfully welded the peoples and subcultures of the Visigothic kingdom into a united nation, while at the same time putting an end to the heresies of Arianism and Nestorianism. He used resources of education, such as Aristotelian philosophy, to counteract increasingly influential Gothic barbarism throughout his episcopal jurisdiction.

Isidore was the first Christian writer to try to compile a summa of universal knowledge, in his most important work, the *Etymologiae* (Latin: *Etymology*), also known by classicists as the *Origines* (Latin: Origins). This encyclopedia—the first such Christian epitome—formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 volumes. Isidore's work contains many fragments of classical learning that otherwise would have been hopelessly lost. The fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the Middle Ages. It was the most popular compendium in medieval libraries.

Isidore of Seville died on April 4, 636 AD after serving more than 32 years as Archbishop of Seville. He was one of the last of the ancient Christian philosophers and was contemporary with the Greek Father [St. Maximus the Confessor](/people/saints/greek-fathers/maximus-the-confessor). He has been called the most learned man of his age by some scholars, and he exercised a far-reaching and immeasurable influence on the educational life of the Middle Ages. His contemporary and friend, Braulio of Zaragoza (northeastern Spain), regarded him as a man raised up by God to save the Spanish peoples from the tidal wave of barbarism that threatened to inundate the ancient civilization of Hispania. Isidore was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1722 by Pope Innocent XIII.
