In 410 AD, the Visigoths sacked Rome, which marked the first time in almost 800 years that Rome had been besieged by a foreign enemy. During this time, Rome also lost control of Britain, as no troops could be spared to fend off the incoming Anglo-Saxons. In 455 AD, yet another Germanic group, the Vandals, launched an even more severe attack on Rome, which marked the decline and impending fall of the Western Roman Empire. Odoacer, a Germanic military leader, led a revolt and deposed the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 AD. Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, overthrew Odoacer in 493 AD.

[Pope St. Gregory I](/glossary/names#gregory) (540–604 AD) was born in Rome during the Ostrogoth occupation into a wealthy noble Roman family with close connections to the church. His father, Gordianus was a patrician who served as a senator and for a time was the Prefect of the City of Rome, and a Regionarius in the church. Gregory's mother, Silva, and his two paternal aunts, Trasilla and Emiliana, are honored as saints. Gregory's grandfather was Pope Felix III. Gregory's later election as pope made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period.

In 542 AD, the Plague of Justinian swept through the provinces of the empire, including Italy. The plague caused famine, panic, and sometimes rioting. In some parts of the country, over a third of the population was wiped out or destroyed, with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the empire.

Byzantine emperor Justinian I defeated the Ostrogoths at the end of the Gothic War in 554 AD, but the war was a devastating blow to Italy, and the territory was left weakened. The Lombards, a Germanic group from the areas of modern northern Germany and Denmark, eventually conquered Rome in 568 AD.

Like most young men of his position in Roman society, Gregory was well educated, learning grammar, rhetoric, the sciences, literature, and law; he excelled in all these fields. He had a high level of Latin but did not read or write Greek. He became a government official, advancing quickly in rank to become, like his father, Prefect of Rome, the highest civil office in the city, when only 33 years old.

After his father's death, Gregory converted his family estate on the Caelian Hill (one of the famous seven hills of Rome) into a monastery dedicated to Andrew the Apostle, and turned to a life of contemplation.

> "In that silence of the heart, while we keep watch within through contemplation, we are as if asleep to all things that are without."

> <cite>Gregory the Great</cite>

Gregory had a deep respect for the monastic life and particularly the vow of poverty. He viewed being a monk as the "ardent quest for the vision of our Creator." Eventually, Pope Pelagius II ordained Gregory a deacon.

In 579 AD, Gregory was chosen to be an ambassador to the imperial court in Constantinople. Gregory was part of the Roman delegation that arrived in Constantinople to ask the emperor for military aid against the Lombards. The emperor, however, was more focused on other military threats and didn't send any troops to help Rome.

In Constantinople, Gregory took issue with Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople, who had recently published a treatise which maintained that the resurrected body "will be more subtle than air, and no longer palpable". Gregory opposed and used the palpability of the risen Christ in Luke 24:39 as evidence. Byzantine emperor, Tiberius II Constantine, decided in favor of palpability and ordered Eutychius' book to be burned.

Gregory left Constantinople for Rome in 585 AD, returning to his monastery on the Caelian Hill. Gregory was elected by acclamation to succeed Pope Pelagius II in 590 AD, when the latter died of the plague spreading through the city. Gregory was approved by an imperial decree from Constantinople the following September—as was the norm during the Byzantine Papacy.

Gregory much preferred the monastic lifestyle of contemplation. He bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk. Among his first acts as pope was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the position and praising the contemplative life of the monks. The Holy See had not exerted effective leadership in the West since the pontificate of Gelasius I. In Gaul (modern-day France), bishops often came from powerful local families and were closely connected to them, as seen with Gregory of Tours. In Visigothic Spain, bishops had little interaction with Rome. In Italy, the regions under papal control faced challenges from the aggressive Lombard dukes and the competing interests of the Byzantines.

Gregory had strong convictions on missions. In 595 AD he chose Augustine of Canterbury, the first Archbishop of Canterbury (in Kent, southeast England), to lead a mission to Britain to convert the Anglo-Saxons. This became known as the Gregorian mission. In 601 AD, Gregory sent another notable missionary, Paulinus, who became the first Bishop of York (in North Yorkshire, northeast England).

> "Almighty God places good men in authority that he may impart through them the gifts of his mercy to their subjects. And this we find to be the case with the British over whom you have been appointed to rule, that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also."

Gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="servus-servorum-dei" text="Servus servorum Dei" />* as a papal title, thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes. Gregory is known for his extensive administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at Rome. The poor were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the Lombards. The philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward.

> "I hold the office of steward to the property of the poor"

He organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief. In doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting, which was not to be invented for centuries. To pay for the increased expenses due to charitable giving, he liquidated assets and paid the expenses in cash.

Gregory also organized the church's extensive farmlands to produce and ship food to Rome for distribution as alms. To those who could not go to the church for alms, Gregory sent a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the poor were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 guests from the laity. To the needy living in homes, he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. These and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the Roman people. They now looked to the papacy for government, ignoring the state at Constantinople.

Gregory made numerous liturgical reforms, many of which still exist to this day in the Roman Catholic Church. The mainstream form of Western plainchant, standardized in the late 9th century, was attributed to Pope Gregory I and so took the name of Gregorian chant. The earliest such attribution is in John the Deacon's biography of Gregory in 873 AD, almost three centuries after the pope's death, and the chant that bears his name "is the result of the fusion of Roman and Frankish elements which took place in the Franco-German empire under Pepin, Charlemagne and their successors". Gregory is commonly credited with founding the medieval papacy and so many attribute the beginning of medieval spirituality to him.

Gregory is the only pope between the 5th and the 11th centuries whose correspondence and writings have survived enough to form a comprehensive corpus. His writings include *Moralia in Job* (Latin: "Morals in Job"), based on talks Gregory gave on the Book of Job, and is one of the longest patristic works; *Liber regulae pastoralis* (Latin: "Pastoral Care"), in which he contrasted the role of bishops as pastors of their flock with their position as nobles of the church: the definitive statement of the nature of the episcopal office; *Dialogi* (Latin: "Dialogues"), a collection of four books of miracles, signs, wonders, and healings done by the holy men, mostly monastic, of sixth-century Italy, with the second book entirely devoted to the life of Saint Benedict; and some 854 surviving letters.

Gregory was declared a saint immediately after his death by popular acclamation. He was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Boniface VIII in 1298. He is one of the four original Doctors of the Latin Church, alongside [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose), [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine), and [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome). Because the day of his death, March 12, falls during the season of Lent, his feast day is celebrated on September 3, the day of his episcopal consecration. The Protestant reformer John Calvin admired Gregory greatly and declared in his *Institutes* that Gregory was the last good pope.
