<Initial text="Bartholomew"/>

[St. Bartholomew](/glossary/names#bartholomew), whose Hebrew name is [Nathanael](/glossary/names#nathanael), was a friend of [St. Philip](/people/saints/philip) from Cana (west of the Sea of Galilee) (Matt. 10:3) (John 1:45) (John 21:2). He was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:3).

Bartholomew famously asked Philip if anything good could come from Nazareth (John 1:46). When Jesus met him, he told him something only God would know, and he came to believe. Jesus told him, however, that he would see greater things—namely angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man (John 1:47-51) (cf. Gen. 28:10-12).
