<Initial text="Bartholomew"/>

[St. Bartholomew](/glossary/names#bartholomew), whose Hebrew name is [Nathanael](/glossary/names#nathanael), was a friend of Philip from Cana (west of the Sea of Galilee) (Matt. 10:3) (John 1:45) (John 21:2). He was an apostle called with the original twelve (Matt. 10:3).

Bartholomew famously asks Philip if anything good can come from Nazareth (John 1:46). When Jesus meets him, he tells him something only God could know, and he comes to believe. Jesus tells him, however, that he will see greater things than these—namely angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man (John 1:47-51) (cf. Gen. 28:10-12).
