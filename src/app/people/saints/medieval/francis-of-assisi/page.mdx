<Initial text="Francis of Assisi"/>

[St. Francis of Assisi](/glossary/names#francis) (1181–1226) was born Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone. While his father Pietro di Bernardone—a wealthy Italian silk merchant—was on business in France, his mother Pica di Bourlemont—a French noblewoman—had him baptized and named him Giovanni—the Italian form of the name [John](/glossary/names#john), after [ St. John the Baptist](/people/saints/biblical/john-the-baptist). His father, on the other hand, took to calling him Francesco, which means "Frenchman". The English form of the name is Francis.

Francis was born in Assisi (a town in the Province of Perugia in the Umbria region of central Italy), and lived a wealthy and lavish lifestyle. In his youth, he surrounded himself with friends who spent their nights at wild parties. Eventually, however, Francis wanted to renounce his life of wealth and concupiscence in favor of a life of service. On one occasion, he was selling cloth and velvet in the marketplace on behalf of his father when a beggar came to him and asked for alms. After he finished his sale, Francis ran after the beggar. When he found him, he gave the man all the money he had with him. His friends mocked him, and his father scolded him in rage.

In around 1202, he joined a military expedition against Perugia and was taken as a prisoner at Collestrada. He spent a year as a captive, during which an illness caused him to re-evaluate his life. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, however, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for Apulia (a region in the southeast of Italy) to enlist in the army of Walter III, Count of Brienne during the Fourth Crusade. On his way, however, he had a vision in which God told him all that he had done wrong in his life and told him to return home. Francis returned to Assisi, and thereafter began to avoid the wild parties of his former companions. A friend asked him whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, "Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen", referring to "Lady Poverty", what he would come to call the life of renouncing one's wealth.

On a pilgrimage to Rome, he joined the poor in begging at St. Peter's Basilica. He spent some time in lonely places, asking God for divine illumination. His search led him to the ancient church at San Damiano which was falling into disrepair. While he was praying there, he heard Christ on the crucifix speak to him, "Francis, repair my church." Francis then took fabric from his father's shop and sold it to get money to repair the church. His father, who saw this as an act of theft, became furious, and Francis fled and hid in a cave near San Damiano for about a month to avoid his wrath. When he returned to town, hungry and dirty, he was dragged home by his father, beaten, bound, and locked in a small storeroom. Freed by his mother during his father's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest. His father, however, soon cited him before the city consuls, and sought to force Francis to renounce his inheritance. In the midst of legal proceedings before the Bishop of Assisi, Francis stripped himself and renounced his father and his patrimony.

For the next couple of months, Francis wandered as a beggar in the hills behind Assisi. He spent some time at a neighboring monastery working as a kitchen helper. He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city, begging for stones for the restoration of San Damiano. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a penitent, during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina, and the Porziuncola, the little chapel of St. Mary of the Angels in the plain just below the town. He also took to nursing lepers near Assisi.

One morning in February 1208, Francis was taking part in a Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels. The Gospel of the day was the "Commissioning of the Twelve" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples were to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse wool tunic, the garb then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around himself with a knotted rope and went about exhorting the people of the countryside to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual as he had no license to do so. His example attracted others. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a simple life in the deserted leper colony of Rivo Torto near Assisi. They spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of Umbria, making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.

In 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (<Definition lang="latin" anchor="frater" text="friars" />), the "Primitive Rule" (Latin: *Regula primitiva*), which came from verses in the Bible. The basis of the rule was "to follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps." He then led eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from Pope Innocent III to found a new religious order. Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company Giovanni di San Paolo, the Cardinal Bishop of Sabina. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official audience.

A number of the pope's counsellors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis to be unsafe and impractical, however, the pope had a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the Lateran Basilica, and in 1210 decided to endorse Francis' order. The group was tonsured, which is important as it recognized Church's authority, and prevented accusations of heresy, as had happened to the Waldensians decades earlier. Francis was later ordained a deacon.

Francis set out to replicate Christ and literally carry out his work. This is important in understanding Francis' character, his affinity for the Eucharist, and his respect for the priests who carried out the Sacrament. He preached: "Your God is of your flesh, He lives in your nearest neighbor, in every man." He believed that nature itself was the mirror of God. He called all creatures his "brothers" and "sisters", and even preached to the birds, and supposedly persuaded a wolf in Gubbio to stop attacking some locals if they agreed to feed it. Many of the stories that surround the life of Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment. His deep sense of brotherhood under God embraced others, and he declared that "he considered himself no friend of Christ if he did not cherish those for whom Christ died".

Francis' order grew quickly. Hearing Francis preaching in the church of San Rufino in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman Clare of Assisi sought to live like them. Her cousin Rufino also sought to join. On the night of Palm Sunday, March 28, 1212, Clare secretly left her family's palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Clares. He gave Clare a religious habit (a garment similar to his own) before lodging her, her younger sister Caterina, and other young women in a nearby monastery of Benedictine nuns until he could provide a suitable monastery. Later he transferred them to San Damiano, to a few small huts or cells. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as Poor Clares. For those who could not leave their affairs, Francis later formed the Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance, a fraternity composed of either laity or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took religious vows. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives.

Determined to bring the Gospel to all peoples and let God convert them, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In approximately 1211, a captain of the Medrano family held the lordship of the castle and town of Agoncillo, situated near the city of Logroño, in the region of La Rioja, Spain. Medrano's son was suffering from a mysterious and untreatable ailment. In 1211, Saint Francis of Assisi roamed those very paths of Agoncillo. He visited Medrano's Agoncillo castle, placed his hands upon the ailing Medrano boy, and miraculously healed him, securing the Medrano lineage in Agoncillo. As a result, the Medrano family are distinguished by their devotion to Saint Francis of Assisi. The Medrano family generously donated some land, including a tower, situated close to the Ebro River within the city of Logroño as a gift to Saint Francis, where he established the first Spanish convent of his Order there.

In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the Dalmatian coast, forcing him to return to Italy. In 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of La Verna as a gift from Count Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as "eminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind". The mountain would become one of his favorite retreats for prayer.

During the Fifth Crusade in 1219, Francis went to Egypt where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of Damietta. He was accompanied by Friar Illuminatus of Arce and hoped to convert the Sultan of Egypt or be martyred in the attempt. The Sultan, al-Kamil, a nephew of Saladin, had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on August 29, 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire that lasted four weeks. Probably during this interlude Francis and his companion crossed Muslim lines and were brought before the Sultan, remaining in his camp for a few days. The Sultan received Francis graciously, and Francis preached to the Muslims. He returned unharmed. The Franciscans have maintained a presence in the Holy Land almost uninterruptedly since then, and remain there even today.

At Greccio near Assisi, around 1220, Francis celebrated Christmas by setting up the first known Nativity scene. He used real animals to create a living scene so that the worshipers could contemplate the birth of the child Jesus in a direct way, making use of the senses, especially sight.

The growing order of friars was eventually divided into provinces; groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in Morocco, Francis returned to Italy via Venice. Cardinal Ugolino di Conti (who later became Pope Gregory IX) was then nominated by the pope as the protector of the order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the "First Rule" (Latin: *Regula prima*) or "Rule Without a Papal Bull" (Latin: *Regula non bullata*), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced a greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.

Francis modified the "First Rule", creating the "Second Rule" (Latin: *Regula secunda*) or "Rule With a Bull" (Latin: *Regula bullata*), which was approved by Pope Honorius III on November 29, 1223. As the order's official rule, it called on the friars "to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity". In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entering the order. Once the rule was endorsed by the pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs.

Francis traveled to the mountain of La Verna to pray during a forty-day fast in preparation for the Feast of the Archangels (September 29). On the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross (September 14), Francis had a vision in which he saw a seraph on a cross who gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ, or <Definition lang="greek" anchor="stigmata" text="stigmata"/>. One of his disciples, Brother Leo, wrote a testimony of the event. Following the event, Francis began to go blind, and the bishop of Ostia ordered that his eyes be operated on which meant cauterizing the eyes with hot irons. Francis claims to have felt nothing at all when this was done. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here he spent his last days dictating his spiritual testament. He died on the evening of October 3, 1226, singing Psalm 142, "With my voice I cry out to the Lord".

On July 16, 1228, he was declared a saint by Pope Gregory IX. The next day, the pope laid the foundation stone for the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi. Francis was buried on May 25, 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden in order to protect it from Muslim invaders. His burial place remained unknown until it was rediscovered in 1818. His feast day is October 4th, as his death occurred the evening of the 3rd, and the day after marked his entry into heaven.
