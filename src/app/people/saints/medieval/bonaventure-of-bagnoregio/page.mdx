<Initial text="Bonaventure of Bagnoregio" />

[St. Bonaventure of Bagnoregio](/glossary/names#bonaventure) (1221–1274) was born at Civita di Bagnoregio in central Italy, then part of the Papal States. In his youth, he was saved from an untimely death by the prayers of [St. Francis of Assisi](/people/saints/medieval/francis-of-assisi), which led him to write *The Life of Saint Francis*. He entered the Franciscan Order in 1243 and studied at the University of Paris. In 1253 he held the Franciscan chair at Paris. Around 1254, he held the position of lecturer on *The Four Books of Sentences*—a compendium of theology written by the 12th century Italian scholastic theologian and Bishop of Paris [Peter Lombard](/people/scholars/peter-lombard)—and in 1255 he received the degree of master, the medieval equivalent of a doctorate.

A dispute between seculars (clergy within the established hierarchy of the Church) and <Definition lang="latin" anchor="mendicans" text="mendicants" /> (those who took monastic vows) delayed Bonaventure's reception as Master until 1257, where his degree was taken in company with [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas). The seculars saw the mendicant life of poverty and increase of influence in the universities as an affront to ecclesiastical power. After having successfully defended his order against the reproaches of the anti-mendicant party, he was elected Minister General of the Franciscan Order. On November 24, 1265, he was selected for the post of Archbishop of York; however, he was never consecrated and resigned the appointment in October 1266.

Bonaventure steered the Franciscans on a moderate and intellectual course that made them the most prominent order in the Catholic Church. His theology was marked by an attempt completely to integrate faith and reason. He taught that Christ is the one true Master who offers humans knowledge that begins in faith, is developed through rational understanding, and is perfected by mystical union with God. Like all the great scholastic doctors, Bonaventure starts with the discussion of the relations between reason and faith. All the sciences are but the handmaids of theology; reason can discover some of the moral truths that form the groundwork of Christianity, but other truths can only be received and apprehended through divine illumination. To obtain this illumination, the soul must employ the proper means, which are prayer; the exercise of the virtues, whereby it is rendered fit to accept the divine light; and meditation that may rise even to ecstatic union with God. The supreme end of life is a union in contemplation or intellect or intense absorbing love; but it cannot be entirely reached in this life, and remains as a hope for the future.

Bonaventure wrote on almost every subject treated by the Scholastics, and his writings are substantial. A great number of them deal with faith in Christ, God and theology. No work of Bonaventure's is exclusively philosophical, a striking illustration of the mutual interpenetration of philosophy and theology that is a distinguishing mark of the Scholastic period. His works consisted of a *Commentary on the Sentences of Lombard*, in four volumes, and eight other volumes, including a *Commentary on the Gospel of St Luke* and a number of smaller works; the most famous of which are *The Mind's Road to God* (Latin: *Itinerarium mentis in Deum*), an outline of his theology or *Brief Reading* (Latin: *Breviloquium*), *Reduction of the Arts to Theology* (Latin: *De reductione artium ad theologiam*), and *Soliloquy on the Four Spiritual Exercises* (Latin: *Soliloquium de quatuor mentalibus exercitiis*), *The Tree of Life* (Latin: *Lignum vitae*), and *The Triple Way* (Latin: *De Triplici via*), the latter three written for the spiritual direction of his fellow Franciscans.

Much of Bonaventure's philosophical thought shows a considerable influence by [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo). Bonaventure adds Aristotelian principles to the Augustinian doctrine, especially in connection with the illumination of the intellect and the composition of human beings and other living creatures in terms of matter and form. Augustine, who had introduced into the west many of the doctrines that would define scholastic philosophy, was a critically important source of Bonaventure's Platonism. Pseudo-Dionysius was another notable influence.

Bonaventure was instrumental in procuring the election of Pope Gregory X, who rewarded him with the title of Cardinal Bishop of Albano, and insisted on his presence at the great Second Council of Lyon in 1274 (the fourteenth ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church, which was called to discuss the conquest of the Holy Land, the union of the Eastern and Western Churches, purgatory, and other issues). Thomas Aquinas had been summoned to the council, but died en route at Fossanova Abbey. Bonaventure was present at the first four sessions but died at Lyon on July 15, 1274.

Bonaventure was formally canonized in 1482 by the Franciscan Pope Sixtus IV, and ranked along with Thomas Aquinas as the greatest of the Doctors of the Church by another Franciscan, Pope Sixtus V, in 1587. Bonaventure was regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of the Middle Ages.
