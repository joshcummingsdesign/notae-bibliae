<Initial text="Thomas Aquinas" />

[St. Thomas Aquinas](/glossary/names#thomas) (1225–1274) was born to a wealthy family in Roccasecca, near Aquino (hence the name Aquinas), controlled at that time by the Kingdom of Sicily (in modern Lazio, Italy). His father, Landulf of Aquino, was a knight in the service of Emperor Frederick II. His mother, Theodora, was a relative of Emperor Frederick II. His uncle, Sinibald, was abbot of Monte Cassino, the oldest [Benedictine](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) monastery, which had political and social status. While the rest of the family's sons pursued military careers, the family intended for Thomas to follow his uncle into the abbacy.

Around the age of 14, Thomas' parents enrolled him at the University of Naples. It was there that Thomas was introduced to Aristotle, Averroes (Andalusian philosopher), and Maimonides, all of whom would influence his theological philosophy. During his study at Naples, Thomas also came under the influence of John of St. Julian, a [Dominican](/people/saints/medieval/dominic-of-osma) preacher in Naples, who was part of the active effort by the Dominican Order to recruit devout followers.

At the age of nineteen, Thomas resolved to join the Dominican Order. Thomas' decision, however, did not please his family. The Dominicans were an upstart order of poor, itinerant friars with very little property and no abbeys with stability of place. In an attempt to prevent his mother's interference in Thomas' choice, the Dominicans arranged to move Thomas to Rome, and from Rome to Paris, however, while on his journey to Rome, his mother ordered his brothers seize him as he was drinking from a spring and take him back to his parents at the castle of Monte San Giovanni Campano.

Thomas was held prisoner for almost one year in the family castles at Monte San Giovanni and Roccasecca in an attempt to prevent him from joining the Dominican order. During this time, Thomas tutored his sisters and continued to correspond with members of the Dominican Order.

Family members became desperate to dissuade Thomas, who remained determined to join the Dominicans. At one point, two of his brothers resorted to the measure of hiring a prostitute to seduce him, presumably because sexual temptation might dissuade him from a life of celibacy. Thomas drove her away wielding a burning log, with which he inscribed a cross onto the wall. In a vision, two angels appeared to him and said, "Behold, we gird thee by the command of God with the girdle of chastity, which henceforth will never be imperiled. What human strength can not obtain, is now bestowed upon thee as a celestial gift." From then onwards, Thomas was given the grace of perfect chastity by Christ, a girdle he wore until the end of his life. The girdle was given to the ancient monastery of Vercelli in Piedmont (northwestern Italy), and is now at Chieri, near Turin.

By 1244, seeing that all her attempts to dissuade Thomas had failed, Theodora sought to save the family's dignity, arranging for Thomas to escape at night through his window. In her mind, a secret escape was less damaging than an open surrender to the Dominicans. Thomas was sent first to Naples and then to Rome to meet Johannes von Wildeshausen, the Master General of the Dominican Order.

In 1245, Thomas was sent to study at the University of Paris, where he most likely met Dominican scholar Albertus Magnus, the holder of the Chair of Theology at the College of St. James in Paris. When Albertus was sent by his superiors to teach at the University of Cologne in 1248, Thomas followed him, declining Pope Innocent IV's offer to appoint him abbot of Monte Cassino as a Dominican. Albertus then appointed Thomas as a student teacher. Because Thomas was quiet and did not speak much, some of his fellow students thought he was slow. But Albertus prophetically exclaimed, "You call him the dumb ox, but in his teaching he will one day produce such a bellowing that it will be heard throughout the world."

In Cologne, Thomas instructed students on the books of the Old Testament, and wrote *Expositio super Isaiam ad litteram* (Latin: "Literal Commentary on Isaiah"), *Postilla super Ieremiam* (Latin: "Commentary on Jeremiah"), and *Postilla super Threnos* (Latin: "Commentary on Lamentations"). In 1252, he returned to Paris to study for a master's degree in theology. He lectured on the Bible, and devoted his final three years of study to commenting on [Peter Lombard's](/people/scholars/peter-lombard) *Sentences* (a compendium of theology written by the 12th century Italian scholastic theologian and Bishop of Paris). In the first of his four theological syntheses, Thomas composed a massive commentary on the *Sentences* entitled, *Scriptum super libros Sententiarium* (Latin: "Commentary on the Sentences"). Aside from his master's writings, he wrote *De ente et essentia* (Latin: "On Being and Essence") for his fellow Dominicans in Paris.

In 1256, Thomas was appointed regent master in theology at Paris and one of his first works upon assuming this office was *Contra impugnantes Dei cultum et religionem* (Latin: Against Those Who Assail the Worship of God and Religion), defending the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="mendicans" text="mendicant" /> orders (the orders which include the [Franciscans](/people/saints/medieval/francis-of-assisi) and Dominicans), which had come under attack by William of Saint-Amour, who saw their life of poverty and increase of influence in the universities as an affront to ecclesiastical power.

During his tenure from 1256 to 1259, Thomas wrote numerous works, including: *Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate* (Latin: "Disputed Questions on Truth"), a collection of twenty-nine disputed questions on aspects of faith and the human condition prepared for the public university debates he presided over during Lent and Advent; *Quaestiones quodlibetales* (Latin: "Quodlibetal Questions"), a collection of his responses to questions posed to him by the academic audience; and both *Expositio super librum Boethii De trinitate* (Latin: "Commentary on Boethius' 'On the Trinity'") and *Expositio super librum Boethii De hebdomadibus* (Latin: "Commentary on Boethius' 'On Weeks'"), commentaries on the works of 6th-century Roman philosopher Boethius. By the end of his regency, Thomas began working on one of his most famous works, *Summa contra Gentiles* (Latin: "Summary Against the Gentiles").

In 1259, Thomas returned to Naples where he was appointed as general preacher. In 1261 he was called to Orvieto where he completed *Summa contra Gentiles*, wrote the *Catena aurea* (Latin: "The Golden Chain"), and produced works for Pope Urban IV such as the liturgy for the newly-created feast of Corpus Christi and the *Contra errores graecorum* (Latin: "Against the Errors of the Greeks"). Some of the hymns that Thomas wrote for the feast of Corpus Christi are still sung today, such as the *Pange lingua* (Latin: "Sing, my Tongue") and *Panis angelicus* (Latin: "Bread of Angels").

In 1265, the newly-elected pope, Clement IV, summoned Thomas to Rome to serve as papal theologian. This same year, he was ordered by the Dominican Chapter of Agnani to teach at the *<Definition lang="latin"anchor="studium-conventuale" text="studium conventuale" />*, the first school to teach the full range of philosophical subjects, both moral and natural, at the Roman convent of Santa Sabina. There, Thomas began his most famous work, the *Summa Theologiae* (Latin: "Summary of Theology"). Thomas began the *Summa* as a teaching tool for young Dominican friars, saying, "Because a doctor of Catholic truth ought not only to teach the proficient, but to him pertains also to instruct beginners. As the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 3:1-2, 'As to infants in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not meat,' our proposed intention in this work is to convey those things that pertain to the Christian religion in a way that is fitting to the instruction of beginners."

In 1268, the Dominican Order assigned Thomas to be regent master at the University of Paris for a second time, where he finished the second part of the *Summa*. He also wrote *De virtutibus* (Latin: "Of the Virtues") and *De aeternitate mundi, contra murmurantes* (Latin: "On the Eternity of the World, against Grumblers"), which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian beginninglessness of the world.

In 1272, Thomas establish a university in Naples where he continued work on the third part of the *Summa* while giving lectures on various religious topics. He also preached to the people of Naples every day during Lent.

On the feast of [St. Nicholas](/people/saints/early/nicholas-of-myra) in 1273, Thomas was celebrating Mass when he received a revelation that so affected him that he wrote and dictated no more, leaving his great work the *Summa* unfinished. His secretary and friend Reginald urged him to continue, but he replied, "The end of my labors has come. All that I have written seems like straw after the things that have been revealed to me." When later asked by Reginald to return to writing, he said, "I can write no more. I have seen things that make my writings like straw." The *Summa* would remain unfinished.

Looking for a way to reunite the Eastern and Western churches, Pope Gregory X convened the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, and summoned Thomas to attend. At the meeting, *Contra errores graecorum* was to be presented. On his way to the council, riding on a donkey along the Appian Way, he struck his head on the branch of a fallen tree. He was quickly escorted to Monte Cassino for recovery. After resting, he set out again, but stopped at the [Cistercian](/people/saints/medieval/bernard-of-clairvaux) Fossanova Abbey after falling ill. The monks nursed him for several days. In his final prayer he said, "I have written and taught much about this very holy Body, and about the other sacraments in the faith of Christ, and about the Holy Roman Church, to whose correction I expose and submit everything I have written." He died on March 7, 1274 while giving commentary on the Song of Songs.

In 1323, he was canonized by Pope John XXII. His feast day was inserted in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on March 7, the day of his death. Since this date commonly falls within Lent, the 1969 revision of the calendar moved his memorial to January 28, the date of the translation of his relics to Church of the Jacobins in Toulouse, France. In 1567, Pope Pius V proclaimed Thomas Aquinas a Doctor of the Church, and ranked his feast with those of the four great [Latin Fathers](/people/saints/latin-fathers): [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan), [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo), [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon), and [Pope St. Gregory I](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great).

In the 16th century,the *<Definition lang="latin"anchor="studium-generale" text="studium generale" />* at Santa Maria sopra Minerva was transformed into the College of Saint Thomas (Latin: *Collegium Divi Thomae*), and then in the 20th century into the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, <Definition lang="latin"anchor="angelicum" text="Angelicum" /> (as in "the Angelic Doctor") sited at the convent of Saints Dominic and Sixtus.
