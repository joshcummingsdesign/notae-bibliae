<Initial text="Anselm of Canterbury" />

[St. Anselm of Canterbury](/glossary/names#anselm) (1033–1109) was born in or around Aosta in Upper Burgundy (modern northwestern Italy). His mother, Ermenberga, belonged to a noble Burgundian family, and his father, Gondolfo, was a Lombard nobleman who intended that Anselm would make a career of politics. At the age of fifteen, Anselm felt the call to enter a monastery but, failing to obtain his father's consent, he was refused by the abbot. After his mother had died, Anselm left home at 23 and headed north across the Alps to France, eventually arriving at the [Benedictine](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) abbey of Bec in Normandy, where he studied under the eminent theologian and dialectician Lanfranc, who was prior (a high-ranking member of a monastery) at that time. After Anselm's father died, Anselm consulted with Lanfranc as to whether to return to his estates and employ their income in providing alms for the poor, or to renounce them in order to become a hermit or a monk. Lanfranc sent Anselm to Maurilius, the Archbishop of Rouen (northern France), who convinced him to enter Bec as a novice (a new member of a religious order accepted on a conditional basis, prior to confirmation) at the age of 27. There, he wrote his first work on philosophy, a treatment of Latin paradoxes called the *Grammarian*. Over the next decade, the Rule of Saint Benedict reshaped his thought.

Three years later, in 1063, Duke William II summoned Lanfranc to serve as the abbot of his new abbey of St Stephen at Caen (northwestern France), and the monks of Bec, despite the initial hesitation of some on account of his youth, elected Anselm as prior. Following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, Bec had been given extensive lands across the English Channel. Anselm occasionally visited to oversee the monastery's property, and to visit Lanfranc, who had been installed as Archbishop of Canterbury (southeast England) in 1070. He was respected by King William I, and the good impression he made while in Canterbury made him the favorite of its cathedral chapter as a future successor to Lanfranc. During this time, he wrote the *Monologion* (Latin: *Monologue*), in which he provides reasons for belief in God without appeal to scriptural or patristic authority, and the *Proslogion* (Latin: *Discourse*), which contains the first, and best-known, ontological argument for the existence of God. He then composed a series of dialogues on the nature of truth, free will, and the fall of Satan.

In 1078, Anselm was unanimously elected as Bec's abbot following the death of its founder Herluin. Anselm was blessed as abbot by Gilbert d'Arques, Bishop of Évreux, on February 22, 1079. Under Anselm's direction, Bec became the foremost seat of learning in Europe, attracting students from France, Italy, and elsewhere. The fame of the monastery grew not only from his intellectual achievements, however, but also from his good example and his loving, kindly method of discipline, particularly with the younger monks.

Following Lanfranc's death in 1089, King William II refused the appointment of any successor, and confiscated the see's revenues and pillaged its lands. At Christmas, William II pledged by the Holy Face of Lucca (an eight-foot-tall wooden carving of Jesus crucified in the cathedral of San Martino, Lucca, Italy, which according to legend was sculpted by Nicodemus) that neither Anselm nor any other would sit at Canterbury while he lived. In March of that year, however, he fell seriously ill. Believing his sinful behavior was responsible, he summoned Anselm to hear his confession and administer last rites. He then nominated Anselm to fill the vacancy at Canterbury. Anselm accepted the position somewhat reluctantly, but with the intention of reforming the English church. He refused to be consecrated as archbishop until William II restored the lands to Canterbury and acknowledged Urban II as the rightful pope against the antipope Clement III. William II agreed to the conditions, and published a proclamation releasing his captives, discharging his debts, and promising to henceforth govern according to the law. On December 4, 1093, Anselm was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury.

In 1098, Anselm published *Cur Deus Homo* (Latin: *Why God was a Man*), a rational argument for the necessity of the Christian mystery of atonement. That same year at the Council of Bari, Anselm delivered his defense of the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="filioque" text="Filioque" /> and the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist. Anselm wrote nearly 500 surviving letters to clerics, monks, relatives, and others. His works were copied and disseminated in his lifetime and exercised an influence on the Scholastics, including [St. Bonaventure](/people/saints/medieval/bonaventure-of-bagone), [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas), [Duns Scotus](/people/scholars/duns-scotus), and [William of Ockham](/people/scholars/william-of-ockham). He has been called "the most luminous and penetrating intellect between [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) and St. Thomas Aquinas" and "the father of scholasticism". Anselm held that faith necessarily precedes reason, but that reason can expand upon faith.

Anselm was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Clement XI in 1720.
