<Initial text="Bernard of Clairvaux" />

[St. Bernard of Clairvaux](/glossary/names#bernard) (1090–1153) was born in Burgundy (east central France) to parents of the highest nobility. At age nine he was sent to a school at Châtillon-sur-Seine where he had an interest in literature and rhetoric. During his education with priests, he often thought of becoming one.

In 1098, a group led by Robert of Molesme had founded Cîteaux Abbey (Latin: *Cistercium*), near Dijon, with the purpose of living according to a literal interpretation of the *[Rule of Saint Benedict](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia)*. They established new administrative structures among their monsteries, effectively creating a new order, known, after the first abbey, as the Order of Cistercians. After his mother died, Bernard decided to go to Cîteaux. In 1113, he and thirty other young noblemen of Burgundy sought admission into the new monastery. Bernard's example was so convincing that many followed him into the monastic life.

Benedictine monasteries historically had a reputation for stability and moderation. Over time, some Benedictine communities became quite wealthy, and their monastic life could be relatively comfortable. Cistercians reacted against what they saw as the excesses of the Benedictines, emphasizing simplicity, manual labor, and poverty. They sought to live a more rigorous interpretation of the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, focusing on solitude, asceticism, and a rejection of material wealth. Cistercian monks also emphasize manual labor as an essential part of their daily life. Their motto, *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="ora-et-labora" text="Ora et labora" />* reflects this balance.

The little community of reformed Benedictines at Cîteaux grew rapidly. Three years after entering, Bernard was sent with a group of twelve monks to found a new house at Vallée d'Absinthe, in the Diocese of Langres. This Bernard named Claire Vallée, or Clairvaux, on June 25, 1115, and the names of Bernard and Clairvaux soon became inseparable. During the absence of the Bishop of Langres, Bernard was blessed as abbot by William of Champeaux, Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne. From then on a strong friendship grew between the abbot and the bishop, who was professor of theology at Notre Dame of Paris and the founder of St. Victor Abbey in Paris.

Bernard went on to be one of the most influential thinkers, teachers, and preachers of the Middle Ages. In a time where philosophy and rhetoric seemed to be winning the day, Bernard advocated for biblical rigorism, in other words the principle that if something is to be believed or taught, it should have its basis in Scripture. He also emphasized what we now call *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="lectio-divina" text="Lectio Divina" />*. He was also one of the devout and strongest voices on the subject of grace, and the sufficiency of Christ's finished work on the cross.

Bernard emphasized the value of personal, experiential friendship with Christ and placed new emphasis on the Virgin Mary. In opposition to the rational approach to divine understanding used by the scholastics, Bernard preached an immediate faith, in which the best intercessor was the Virgin Mary. Bernard had a special devotion to the Virgin Mary, and later wrote several works on the subject.

In 1128, Bernard participated in the Council of Troyes in which he composed a rule for the Knights Templar—a group of monastic knights founded around 1119 to defend pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem, so named because they were headquartered on the Temple Mount.

Around 1145, news came from the Holy Land that Christians had been defeated at the Siege of Edessa (modern southwestern Turkey), and most of the county had fallen into the hands of the Seljuk Turks. Pope Eugene III called for what came to be called the Second Crusade. Initially, there was at first virtually no popular enthusiasm for the Second Crusade as there had been in 1095, but Bernard became instrumentally involved in preaching and launching it. One such instance of his involvement occurred on March 31, 1146, where he preached to an enormous crowd in a field at Vézelay, which resulted in the crowd enlisting en masse. In 1148, the crusaders launched the Siege of Damascus, which was ultimately unsuccessful. The last years of Bernard's life were saddened by the failure of the Second Crusade he had preached, the entire responsibility for which was thrown upon him.

One of Bernard's most famous works was *De consideratione* (Latin: "On Consideration"), which went on to be one of the most widely-read works by Catholics and Protestants alike. John Calvin and Martin Luther quoted Bernard several times in support of the doctrine of *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="sola-fide" text="Sola Fide" />*. Calvin also quotes him in setting forth his doctrine of imputed righteousness.

Bernard was named a Doctor of the Church in 1830. At the 800th anniversary of his death, Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical about him, titled *Doctor Mellifluus* (Latin: "Teacher That Flows with Honey"), in which he labeled him "the last of the Fathers". Bernard's life in the Church was more active than we can imagine possible today. His efforts produced far-reaching results, but he knew that they would have availed little without the many hours of prayer and contemplation that brought him strength and heavenly direction. His life was characterized by a deep devotion to the [Blessed Mother](/people/saints/biblical/mary). His sermons and books about St. Mary are still the standard of Roman Catholic Marian theology to this day.
