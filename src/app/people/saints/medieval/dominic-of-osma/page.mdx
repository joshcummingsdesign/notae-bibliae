<Initial text="Dominic of Guzmán" />

[St. Dominic of Guzmán](/glossary/names#dominic) (1170–1221) was born in Caleruega in northern Spain, halfway between Osma and Aranda de Duero in Old Castile. He was named after Dominic of Silos, a Spanish [Benedictine](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) monk whose abbey lies a few miles north of Caleruega. His father Felix was a Spanish nobleman of the House of Guzmán, and his mother Juana was of the neighboring noble Aza family.

The story is told that before his birth his barren mother made a pilgrimage to the Abbey at Silos, and dreamt that a dog leapt from her womb carrying a flaming torch in its mouth, and seemed to set the earth on fire. This story is likely to have emerged when his order became known, after his name, as the Dominican order, *Dominicanus* in Latin, and a play on words interpreted as *Domini canis* (Latin: "Dog of the Lord").

At fourteen years of age, Dominic was sent to the Premonstratensian (a religious order of canons regular—priests who follow a religious order—which originated in France and was largely influenced by the [Cistercians](/people/saints/medieval/bernard-of-clairvaux)) monastery of Santa María de La Vid and subsequently transferred for further studies in the schools of Palencia. In Palencia, he devoted six years to the arts and four to theology. At some point in time he also joined Santa María de La Vid.

In 1191, when Spain was desolated by famine, young Dominic gave away his money and sold his clothes, furniture, and even precious manuscripts to feed the hungry. Dominic reportedly told his astonished fellow students, "How can I study from these books made of animal skins when people are starving?"

At the age of 24, Dominic was ordained as a priest and subsequently joined the canonry of the Cathedral of Osma. In 1198, Don Martin de Bazan, the Bishop of Osma, having reformed the chapter, made Dominic the subprior of the chapter.

Diego de Acebo succeeded Bazan as Bishop of Osma in 1201. Around 1203, Dominic accompanied Diego on a diplomatic mission for Alfonso VIII, King of Castile, to secure a bride in Denmark for crown prince Ferdinand. The envoys traveled to Denmark via Aragon and the south of France. The marriage negotiations ended successfully, but the princess died before leaving for Castile. During their return journey, they met with Cistercian monks who had been sent by Pope Innocent III to preach against the Cathars, a religious sect with gnostic and dualistic beliefs which the Catholic Church deemed heretical. Dominic and Diego de Acebo attributed the Cistercians' lack of success to their extravagance and pomp compared to the asceticism of the Cathars. Dominic and Diego decided to adopt a more ascetic way of life and began a program in the south of France to convert the Cathars.

In late 1206, Acebo and his group established themselves at the Monastery of Our Lady of Prouille in France. Bishop Foulques of Toulouse (southern France) allowed them to use the church. The house was intended partly as a refuge for women who had previously lived in Cathar religious houses, and partly the first established base of operations. The first nuns of Prouille lived for several months at Fanjeaux, because the buildings at Prouille were not yet habitable. Dominic gave them the *[Rule of St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo)*. Catholic-Cathar debates were held at Verfeil, Pamiers and Montréal. Ordered by the Pope to return to his diocese, Diego de Acebo died at Osma in December 1207, leaving Dominic alone in his mission.

According to Dominican tradition, in 1208 Dominic experienced a vision of the [Blessed Virgin Mary](/people/saints/biblical/mary) in the church at Prouille, during which she gave him a [rosary](/liturgy/prayers/rosary). This gave rise to the title Our Lady of the Rosary. French Catholic theologian Alanus de Rupe wrote the story of Dominic's vision some two hundred years later, though it is generally not regarded as historical.

In 1215, Dominic established himself, with six followers, in a house given by Peter Seila, a rich resident of Toulouse. Dominic saw the need for a new type of organization to address the spiritual needs of the growing cities of the era, one that would combine dedication and systematic education, with more organizational flexibility than either monastic orders or the secular clergy. He subjected himself and his companions to the monastic rules of prayer and penance; Bishop Foulques gave them written authority to preach throughout the territory of Toulouse. Also in 1215, the year of the Fourth Lateran Council, Dominic and Foulques went to Rome to secure the approval of Pope Innocent III. Dominic returned to Rome a year later and was finally granted written authority in December 1216 by the new pope, Honorius III, for him to form the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="ordo-praedicatorum" text="Ordo Praedicatorum" />*, commonly known as the Dominican Order. In the winter of 1216–1217, at the house of Pope Gregory the GreatX, Dominic first met William of Montferrat, who joined Dominic as a friar in the Order of Preachers and remained a close friend.

The Dominican Order is a <Definition lang="latin" anchor="mendicans" text="mendicant" /> order, which are orders that have adopted for their male members a lifestyle of poverty, traveling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model, which prescribed living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property at all, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached. The members of these orders are not called <Definition lang="greek" anchor="monakhos" text="monks" /> but <Definition lang="latin" anchor="frater" text="friars" />.

Although he traveled extensively to maintain contact with his growing brotherhood of friars, Dominic made his headquarters in Rome. In 1219, Pope Honorius III invited Dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220.

It is said that Dominic abstained from meat, observed stated fasts and periods of silence, selected the worst accommodations and the meanest clothes, and never allowed himself the luxury of a bed. When traveling, he beguiled the journey with spiritual instruction and prayers. It is also said that Dominic frequently traveled barefoot and that rain and other discomforts elicited from his lips nothing but praises to God.

In 1221, Dominic reached the convent of St Nicholas at Bologna, Italy, weary and sick with a fever. Dominic made the monks lay him on some sacking stretched upon the ground, and the brief time that remained to him was spent in exhorting his followers to have charity, to guard their humility, and to make their treasure out of poverty. He died on August 6.

The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its *<Definition lang="latin"anchor="studium-conventuale" text="studium conventuale" />*, the first Dominican *<Definition lang="latin"anchor="studium" text="studium" />* in Rome, occurred with the legal transfer of property from Pope Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on June 5, 1222. The *studium* at Santa Sabina was the forerunner of the *<Definition lang="latin"anchor="studium-generale" text="studium generale" />* at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, which was transformed in the 16th century into the College of [Saint Thomas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas) (Latin: *Collegium Divi Thomae*), and then in the 20th century into the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, <Definition lang="latin"anchor="angelicum" text="Angelicum" /> (as in "the Angelic Doctor") sited at the convent of Saints Dominic and Sixtus.

Dominic was described as being "as tender as a mother, but as strong as a diamond." Dominic's ideal, and that of his Order, was to organically link a life with God, study, and prayer in all forms, with a ministry of salvation to people by the word of God. One of the mottos of the Dominican Order is, *"Contemplāre et contemplāta aliīs trādere"* (Latin: "to contemplate and to pass on the fruits of contemplation").

The spread of the rosary is attributed to the preaching of the Dominicans. For centuries the rosary has been at the heart of the Dominican Order. Pope Pius XI stated, that the rosary is "the principle and foundation on which the Order of St. Dominic rests for perfecting the lives of its members and obtaining the salvation of others."

Dominic was canonized by Pope Gregory the GreatX in 1234. His memorial is on August 8, the day of his birth.
