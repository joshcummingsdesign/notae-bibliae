<Initial text="Benedict of Nursia"/>

The main account of the life of [St. Benedict of Nursia](/glossary/names#benedict) (480–547 AD) is found in the second volume of [Pope St. Gregory I's](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great) four-book *Dialogues* (c. 593). Benedict was the son of a Roman noble of Nursia (modern southeastern Umbria, Italy). Benedict was sent to Rome to study, but was disappointed by urban academic life. Seeking to escape the great city, he left with his servant and settled in Enfide (modern Affile), about forty miles east of Rome, and five miles south of Subiaco. There, Benedict met a monk named Romanus of Subiaco who inspired him to become a hermit. Benedict became a hermit for three years, and lived in a cave at Subiaco. Romanus served Benedict in every way he could, visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food.

During these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, Benedict matured both in mind and character, in knowledge of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the abbot of a nearby monastery, the community came to him and begged him to become its abbot. Despite their customs being vastly different than his, he consented, however, sometime later the monks tried to poison his drink. Benedict prayed a blessing over the cup and the cup shattered. He then left and went back to his cave at Subiaco.

Sometime later a priest named Florentius became envious of Benedict and tried to poison his bread. Benedict prayed a blessing over the bread and a raven swept in and took the loaf away. From this time his miracles seem to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his sanctity and character, came to Subiaco to be under his guidance. Benedict went on to found 12 monasteries in the vicinity of Subiaco. Having failed to poison Benedict, Florentius tried to seduce Benedict's monks with prostitutes. Eventually, Benedict left Subiaco, and in 530 he founded the great Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino, which lies on a hilltop between Rome and Naples. It was around this time he wrote the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.

Benedict wrote the *Rule of Saint Benedict* for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot. The *Rule* comprises seventy-three short chapters. In chapter 73, Benedict commends the [*Rule of Saint Basil*](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/basil-the-great) and alludes to further authorities. He was probably aware of the Rule written by [St. Pachomius](/people/saints/desert-fathers/pachomius-the-great), and his *Rule* also shows influence by the [*Rule of Saint Augustine*](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) and the writings of [St. John Cassian](/people/saints/early/john-cassian). The *Rule* also shows strong affinity with the anonymous work—written two or three decades prior—known as the *Rule of the Master*, but has a unique spirit of balance, moderation and reasonableness. The *Rule* consists of a twofold wisdom: spiritual (how to live a Christocentric life on earth) and administrative (how to run a monastery efficiently). More than half of the chapters describe how to be obedient and humble, and what to do when a member of the community is not. About one-fourth is on the [Liturgy of the Hours](/liturgy/rites/liturgy-of-the-hours), also known as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="officium" text="Divine Office"/> or *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="opus-dei" text="Opus Dei" />*, and one-tenth outlines how, and by whom, the monastery should be managed. Benedictine asceticism is known for its moderation.

The spirit of the *Rule of Saint Benedict* is summarized by *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="pax" text="Pax"/>* and *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="ora-et-labora" text="Ora et labora"/>*. Compared to other precepts, the *Rule* provides a moderate path between individual zeal and formulaic institutionalism; because of this middle ground, it has been widely popular. Benedict's concerns were his views of the needs of monks in a community environment: namely, to establish due order, to foster an understanding of the relational nature of human beings, and to provide a spiritual father to support and strengthen the individual's ascetic effort and the spiritual growth that is required for the fulfillment of the human vocation, <Definition lang="greek" anchor="theosis" text="theosis"/>.

One of Benedict's main principles of the religious life was the renunciation of one's own will and arming oneself with the strong and noble weapons of obedience under the banner of the true King, Christ the Lord. Among these "weapons" were humility, which he divided into 12 key points:

1. Fear God
2. Subordinate one's will to the will of God
3. Be obedient to one's superior
4. Be patient amid hardships
5. Confess one's sins
6. Hold oneself as a humble servant
7. Consider oneself inferior to all
8. Follow examples set by superiors
9. Do not speak until spoken to
10. Do not readily laugh
11. Speak simply and modestly
12. Express one's inward humility through bodily posture

*The Rule of Saint Benedict*—drawing from the [Apostolic Fathers](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers), [Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers), and St. John Cassian—gives a detailed description of the Divine Office as seven daytime hours and one at night, which are associated with Psalm 119:164, "Seven times a day I praise you", and Psalm 119:62, "At midnight I rise to praise you".

The *Rule of Saint Benedict* has been used by Benedictines for 15 centuries, and thus Benedict is sometimes regarded as the founder of Western monasticism. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Benedict intended to found a religious order in the modern sense, and it was not until the Late Middle Ages that mention was made of an "Order of Saint Benedict". His Rule was written as a guide for individual, autonomous communities, and all Benedictine Houses still remain self-governing.

Benedict died of a fever on March 21, 547 at Monte Cassino not long after his sister, Scholastica, and was buried in the same tomb. A basilica was built upon the birthplace of Benedict and Scholastica in the 15th century. He was named patron protector of Europe by Pope Paul VI in 1964, and in 1980 Pope John Paul II declared him co-patron of Europe, together with Cyril and Methodius (Byzantine Christian theologians and missionaries who were brothers). Because the date of his liturgical memorial fell during Lent, the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar moved it to July 11, the traditional date of his birth.
