## Nativity

A Levitical priest named <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="zecharya" text="Zechariah" /> and his wife Elizabeth have no children and they are advanced in years. As Zechariah is burning incense in the temple in Jerusalem, the angel [Gabriel](/people/saints/angels/gabriel) appears and tells him they will have a son named [John](/glossary/names#john) who will be filled with the Holy Spirit from birth and will prepare the way for the Lord. Zechariah doubts Gabriel because of their age and he is made deaf and mute until John is born.

Elizabeth gives birth, and after eight days, they go to have him circumcised according to the Law (Gen. 17:12). The naming of the child often occurred at this time according to Jewish tradition, as Abraham's name is changed right before he receives the covenant of circumcision (Gen. 17:5) (Gen. 17:10), and the naming and circumcising of Isaac occurs together in Scripture (Gen. 21:3-4). The midwives—who were often involved in the naming of a child (Ruth 4:17)—want to name him after his father Zechariah, which is also the name of the famous prophet, but Elizabeth—prompted by the Holy Spirit—says that he shall be called John. They sign to Zechariah and ask him what the baby should be called, and he writes down, "His name is John." Immediately Zechariah's mouth is opened and he is filled with the Holy Spirit and begins to prophesy. Zechariah blesses God for raising up a Savior for whom his son will prepare the way.

John grows up and is in the wilderness until his public appearance to Israel.

## Biography

The prophet Isaiah tell us that the Lord will come to forgive his people, and that a voice will cry out in the wilderness, "Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God."

The Lord tells us through the prophet Malachi to remember Moses, and that the Lord will send a prophet whose name is "<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="eliyahu" text="Elijah"/>" (Hebrew: "the Lord is my God") who will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers.

The angel Gabriel foretells of the birth of St. John the Baptist, who will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb; and he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of "Elijah" (the one to whom Malachi referred), to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.

John's father Zechariah prophesies that John will be a prophet of the Most High, and he will go before the Lord to prepare his ways.

John lived an ascetic life in the wilderness. He began to lead Israel in repentance in anticipation of the Lord's coming, and began baptizing people in the Jordan as a sign of repentance. God sends John to rebuke the leaders of Israel for their hardness of heart. Jesus comes to John to be baptized in the Jordan to inaugurate his ministry, to identify with the fallen humanity he came to redeem, and to "fulfill all righteousness".

The Jews ask John if he is the Christ, or if he is Elijah the Tishbite (who the Jews incorrectly assumed was the "Elijah" to whom Malachi referred). John tells them he is neither, but that he is the one that Isaiah prophesied about to make straight the way of the Lord. John then testifies that Jesus is the Christ.

John reproves Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, for unlawfully marrying his brother's wife Herodias, and Herod has John thrown in prison. He wants to put him to death, but he fears the people as they know John the Baptist to be a prophet.

Jesus' healing and fame greatly troubled the disciples of John the Baptist, who they believed was the great prophet of their time. The fact that John had been imprisoned was also troubling to them, so they went to John to ask him who Jesus is. Having borne witness already that Jesus is the Christ, John tells two of his disciples to go and ask Jesus who he is, perhaps to prove a point to them, or perhaps because John has doubts and wonders why he has not been set free from prison. Jesus tells them he is indeed the Christ, and that John the Baptist is the prophet whose name is "Elijah"—the one to whom Malachi referred. Jesus then tells them that both "Elijah" and the Christ have come, but that the people have rejected them because it was not in the way that they expected.

Herodias' daughter dances for Herod Antipas and his guests, and he makes an oath to give her whatever she wants. Herodias tells her to ask for the head of John the Baptist. Herod Antipas has John the Baptist executed. John the Baptist's disciples give him a burial and go and tell Jesus the news.

When [St. Peter](/people/saints/apostles/peter), [St. James](/people/saints/apostles/james), and [St. John](/people/saints/apostles/john) see Jesus transfigured on the mountain, they see Moses and Elijah the Tishbite appear and speak with him. Then they hear a voice from the cloud say, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him." When they are coming down the mountain, they ask Jesus why the Scriptures say that Elijah will come before the Christ. Jesus knows they mean Elijah the Tishbite, so he tells them that "Elijah" has already come, but they didn't recognize him, rejected him, and killed him. Jesus tells them he too will be rejected, suffer, and die. Peter, James, and John finally see that John the Baptist was the "Elijah" to whom Malachi referred.
