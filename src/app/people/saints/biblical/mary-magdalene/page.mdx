<Initial text="Mary Magdalene"/>

[St. Mary Magdalene](/glossary/names#mary) was so called because she was from Magdala on the western shore of Galilee. She was one of the the women who traveled with Jesus and the apostles. It is said that seven demons had gone out of her (Luke 8:1-2). She witnessed Jesus' crucifixion (Matt. 27:55-56) (Mark 15:40) (John 19:25), she witnessed Jesus being buried in the tomb (Matt. 27:59-61) (Mark 15:46-47). She was one of the women who went to prepare the burial spices for Jesus (Luke 23:55-56) (Mark 16:1), and on Resurrection Sunday, she was the first to see the empty tomb (John 20:1). Upon seeing the empty tomb, she ran to tell Peter and John (John 20:2), who saw, believed, and returned home (John 20:6-10). Mary stayed and stood weeping at the tomb (John 20:10-11). She then saw two angels sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet (John 20:12). Finally, she was the first person to see the risen Jesus (John 20:15-17), and returned back to tell the disciples what she had seen (John 20:18).
