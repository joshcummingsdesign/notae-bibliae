<Initial text="Silas"/>

[St. Silas](/glossary/names#silas) is first mentioned in Acts 15:22, where he and Judas Barsabbas were selected by the church elders to return with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch following the Jerusalem Council. Silas and Judas are mentioned as being leaders among the brothers, prophets and encouraging speakers (Acts 15:32). Silas was selected by [St. Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) to accompany him on his second mission after St. Paul and [St. Barnabas](/people/saints/apostles/barnabas) split over an argument involving [St. Mark's](/people/saints/evangelists/mark) participation. It was during the second mission that he and Paul were imprisoned briefly in Philippi, where an earthquake broke their chains and opened the prison door (Acts 16:25-37).

According to Acts 17–18, St. Silas and [St. Timothy](/people/saints/biblical/timothy) traveled with Paul from Philippi to Thessalonica, where they were treated with hostility in the synagogues. The harassers followed the trio to Berea, threatening Paul's safety, and causing Paul to separate from Silas and Timothy. Paul traveled to Athens, and Silas and Timothy later joined him in Corinth.

In around 49–51 AD, Paul and Silas establish a church in Thessalonica, but some of the Jews there form a mob and report the Christians to the authorities, claiming that Jesus' authority undermines the authority of Roman emperor Claudius Caesar. Paul and Silas are forced to flee the city, but they receive a report from Timothy that the Thessalonians begin to flourish despite the intense persecution (1 Thess. 3:6).

He is referred to in three of Paul's epistles (1 Thess. 1:1) (2 Thess. 1:1) (2 Cor.1:19). This is as expected, as we read of his involvement in Paul's mission when these cities were visited. He was also involved in sending the [First Epistle of Peter](/bible/new-testament/epistles/1-peter), in which Peter regards him as "a faithful brother" (1 Peter 5:12).
