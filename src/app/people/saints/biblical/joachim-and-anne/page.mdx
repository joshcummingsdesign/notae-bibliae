<Initial text="Joachim and Anne"/>

[Saints Joachim and Anne](/people/saints/biblical/joachim-and-anne) were [St. Mary's](/people/saints/biblical/mary) parents. Joachim was from the line of David, and he and Anne had Mary as their only child. [St. Joseph](/people/saints/biblical/joseph) was also from the line of David. Since the Law required an only daughter to marry within her own family, so as to secure the right of inheritance (Num. 36:8), Joseph and Mary were betrothed.[^1]
