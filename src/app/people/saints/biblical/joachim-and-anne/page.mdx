<Initial text="Joachim and Anne" />

[Saints Joachim and Anne](/people/saints/biblical/joachim-and-anne) were the parents of the [Blessed Virgin Mary](/people/saints/biblical/blessed-virgin-mary). Joachim was from the line of David, and he and Anne had Mary as their only child. [St. Joseph](/people/saints/biblical/joseph-of-nazareth) was also from the line of David. Since the Law required an only daughter to marry within her own family, so as to secure the right of inheritance (Num. 36:8), Joseph and Mary were betrothed.[^1]

## Readings

> "Joachim then took to wife that revered and praiseworthy woman, Anne. But just as [Hannah] (1 Sam. 1:2), who was barren, bore Samuel by prayer and by promise, so also [Anne] by supplication and promise from God bore the Mother of God in order that she might not even in this be behind the matrons of fame. Accordingly it was grace...that bore Our Lady, for she truly became the Lady of all created things in becoming the Mother of the Creator.
>
> Joachim was born [near the Sheep Gate] (John 5:2), and was brought up [according] to the temple. [He and Anne] planted [Mary] in the House of God, and [she] increased [in] the Spirit, like a fruitful olive tree. She became the home of every virtue, turning her mind away from every secular and carnal desire, and thus keeping her soul as well as her body [pure], as was [fitting] for her who was to receive God into her bosom. For as he is holy, he finds rest among the holy. Thus...she strove after holiness, and was declared a holy and wonderful temple fit for the Most High God."
