<Initial text="Joseph of Nazareth" />

[St. Joseph](/glossary/names#joseph) and the [Blessed Virgin Mary](/people/saints/biblical/mary) were both from the line of David. Mary's parents, [Saints Joachim and Anne](/people/saints/biblical/joachim-and-anne), had her as their only child. Since the Law required an only daughter to marry within her own family, so as to secure the right of inheritance (Num. 36:8), Joseph and Mary were betrothed.[^1]

Mary, a virgin, and Joseph, a poor craftsman, lived in Nazareth (west of the Sea of Galilee). Joseph found out Mary was pregnant and assumed that she had been unfaithful. Levitical law required stoning, but he considered quietly divorcing her. An angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him that the child was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and that his name would be Jesus. The angel said that he would fulfill Isaiah's prophecy of Immanuel, which means "God with us" (Isa. 7:14). Joseph then took Mary as his wife, and knew her not until Jesus was born.
