<Initial text="Mary of Bethany" />

[St. Mary of Bethany](/glossary/names#mary) was from Bethany (east of Jerusalem on the road to Jericho at the Mount of Olives), and had two siblings, [St. Martha](/people/saints/biblical/martha) and [St. Lazarus](/people/saints/biblical/lazarus). Her sister Martha became upset when she was sitting at Jesus' feet and while Martha was busy serving, and Jesus told Martha she was anxious about many things, and that Mary had chosen wisely (Luke 10:38-42). When Jesus came to awaken her brother Lazarus, she tells him that if he were there, Lazarus wouldn't have died (John 11:32). Jesus saw her weeping, saw Lazarus' tomb, was deeply moved, and wept (John 11:33-35). Then Jesus raised her brother Lazarus (John 11:43-44). Six days before the Passover, Martha, Mary, and Lazarus gave a dinner for Jesus in Bethany, and Mary anointed him with expensive ointment (John 12:1-3).
