<Initial text="Titus" />

[St. Titus](/glossary/names#titus) was a Greek follower of Jesus and traveling companion of [St. Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) (2 Cor. 8:23).

After St. Paul's conversion, he went with [St. Barnabas](/people/saints/apostles/barnabas) and St. Titus to Jerusalem to share with the apostles what had been revealed to him by Jesus (Gal. 2:1-2). Titus was not required to be circumcised, though he was a Greek (Gal. 2:3).

In around 48 AD, Paul began his second mission with [St. Silas](/people/saints/biblical/silas) (Acts 15:40-41). Paul went to find Titus in Troas (the west coast of Asia Minor), but did not find him, so he left for Macedonia (2 Cor. 2:12-13). When Paul arrived in Macedonia, he found Titus (2. Cor. 7:5-6), who told Paul all about the issues in the church in Corinth (2 Cor. 7:7), and how his faith was refreshed by the faithful there (2 Cor. 7:13-14), and how the faithful were eager to give aid to the church in Jerusalem (2 Cor. 8:4-6). Paul commends Titus for his great love and care of the church in Corinth (2 Cor. 8:16-17).

In around 62–64 AD, Paul was released from prison in Rome (Acts 28:16) and carried on further mission work. Paul sent Titus on a mission to Crete (a large island off the coast of Greece) to restore order to a network of house churches. Cretan culture was notorious for treachery and greed, and most of the men on the island served as mercenary soldiers to the highest bidder. The islands cities were known for being unsafe and plagued by violence and sexual corruption. The island did, however, have many strategic harbors which serviced cities all over the Mediterranean Sea, which made it ideal for establishing a network of churches. These churches came under the influence of corrupt Cretan leaders, so Paul wrote his [Epistle to Titus](/bible/new-testament/epistles/titus) from Nicopolis (in Epirus, modern western Greece) to instruct him on how to restore order.

In around 64–67 AD, Titus departed from Paul and went to the Roman province of Dalmatia—which is either in modern Croatia or Slovenia, though the exact location is unknown (2 Tim. 4:10).
