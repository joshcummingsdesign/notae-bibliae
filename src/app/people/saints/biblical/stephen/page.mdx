[St. Stephen](/glossary/names#stephen) was the first Christian martyr. While the apostles were devoting themselves to the ministry of the word (Acts 6:4), Stephen was one of the seven chosen to serve on behalf of the brothers (Acts 6:5), and the apostles lay their hands on him (Acts 6:6). Stephen did great wonders and signs among the people (Acts 6:8), and was eventually accused of blasphemy and brought before the Sanhedrin (Acts 6:11-12) where they tried him for preaching the gospel (Acts 6:14). He then recounted the Old Testament before the council and boldly rebuked them for resisting the Holy Spirit (Acts 7:51), persecuting the prophets, betraying and murdering Jesus (Acts 7:52), and profaning the Law (Acts 7:53). Before he was killed, he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father (Acts 7:55-56). Stephen was cast out the city and stoned to death (Acts 7:58), and as he was dying he cried out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (Acts 7:59) and "Lord, do not hold this sin against them" (Acts 7:60). His death was greatly lamented (Acts 8:2). The persecution of him and others led Jewish Christians to scatter to places like Antioch (Acts 11:19), where a major church was established, and where the disciples were called Christians for the first time (Acts 11:25-26).
