<Initial text="Philip the Evangelist" />

[St. Philip the Evangelist](/glossary/names#philip) was one of the seven chosen to care for the poor of the Christian community in Jerusalem (Acts 6:3-5), and the apostles lay their hands on him (Acts 6:6). He preached and performed miracles in Samaria (Acts 8:5-6), and met and baptized an Ethiopian man—a eunuch—on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza, traditionally marking the start of the Ethiopian Church (Acts 8:35-38). Later, Philip lived in Caesarea Maritima with his four daughters who prophesied, where he was visited by Paul the Apostle (Acts 21:8-9).
