<Initial text="Martha"/>

[St. Martha](/glossary/names#martha) was from Bethany (east of Jerusalem on the road to Jericho at the Mount of Olives), and had two siblings: [St. Mary of Bethany](/people/saints/biblical/mary-of-bethany) and [St. Lazarus](/people/saints/biblical/lazarus). Martha became upset when her sister Mary was sitting at Jesus' feet and while she was busy serving, and Jesus told her she was anxious about many things, and that her sister had chosen wisely (Luke 10:38-42). When Jesus came to awaken her brother Lazarus, she confessed he is the Christ (John 11:27), then Jesus raised him (John 11:43-44). Six days before the Passover, Martha, Mary, and Lazarus gave a dinner for Jesus in Bethany, and Mary anointed him with expensive ointment (John 12:1-3).
