<Initial text="Lazarus" />

[St. Lazarus](/glossary/names#lazarus) was from Bethany (east of Jerusalem on the road to Jericho at the Mount of Olives), and had two siblings, [St. Martha](/people/saints/biblical/martha) and [St. Mary of Bethany](/people/saints/biblical/mary-of-bethany). He was loved by Jesus, and had become ill (John 11:1-3). He died, and after he had been in the tomb four days, Jesus went to awaken him (John 11:17). After Jesus wept (John 11:34-35), he raised him (John 11:43-44). Six days before the Passover, Martha, Mary, and Lazarus gave a dinner for Jesus in Bethany, and Mary anointed him with expensive ointment (John 12:1-3). The chief priests, learning that Jesus had raised him, plotted to kill Lazarus (John 12:9-10).
