<Initial text="Timothy"/>

[St. Timothy](/glossary/names#timothy) was the son of a Jewish Christian woman and a Greek man. He met [St. Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) during his second mission in Lystra (in Galatia) (Acts 16:1). Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him and [St. Silas](/people/saints/biblical/silas), and wanted him to be circumcised, as to avoid any conflict with the Jews during their mission (Acts. 16:3).

According to Acts 17–18, Silas and Timothy traveled with Paul from Philippi to Thessalonica, where they were treated with hostility in the synagogues. The harassers followed the trio to Berea, threatening Paul's safety, and causing Paul to separate from Silas and Timothy. Paul traveled to Athens, and Silas and Timothy later joined him in Corinth.

In around 49–51 AD, Paul and Silas establish a church in Thessalonica, but some of the Jews there form a mob and report the Christians to the authorities, claiming that Jesus' authority undermines the authority of Roman emperor Claudius Caesar. Paul and Silas are forced to flee the city, but they receive a report from Timothy that the Thessalonians begin to flourish despite the intense persecution (1 Thess. 3:6).

In around 62–64 AD, Paul was released from prison in Rome (Acts 28:16) and carried on further mission work. During this time, he got word that issues arose in the church in Ephesus (western Asia Minor), namely false teaching. Paul sent Timothy to confront the church leaders in Ephesus and restore order to the church. In around 64–67 AD, Paul calls Timothy, who is in Ephesus, to come be with Paul in prison so he can pass on to him the mission he started.
