<Initial text="Mary"/>

[St. Mary](/glossary/names#mary) is the mother of Jesus. Thus, she is also known as the "Mother of God" (Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="theotokos" text="Theotokos"/>*).

St. Mary and [St. Joseph](/people/saints/joseph) were both from the line of David. Mary's parents, [Saints Joachim and Anne](/people/saints/joachim-and-anne), had her as their only child. Since the Law required an only daughter to marry within her own family, so as to secure the right of inheritance (Num. 36:8), Joseph and Mary were betrothed.

Mary, a virgin, and Joseph lived in Nazareth (west of the Sea of Galilee). The angel [Gabriel](/people/saints/gabriel) visited Mary and said, “Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” (Luke 1:28). She was afraid, so Gabriel continued, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end” (Luke 1:30-33) (cf. 2 Sam. 7:16) (cf. Isa. 9:7).

Mary wonders how this will be since she is a virgin, and Gabriel says, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God” (Luke 1:35). Mary responds with, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word” (Luke 1:38).

Joseph finds out Mary is pregnant and assumes she has been unfaithful. Levitical law requires stoning, but he considers quietly divorcing her. An angel appears to him in a dream and tells him the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit and his name will be Jesus, and He will fulfill Isaiah’s prophecy of Immanuel, which means “God with us” (Isa. 7:14). He takes Mary as his wife and knows her not until Jesus is born.

Mary goes to Jerusalem to visit Elizabeth, her relative and the mother of [St. John the Baptist](/people/saints/john-the-baptist). Baby John leaps in Elizabeth’s womb, and Elizabeth is filled with the Holy Spirit, and says to Mary, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord" (Luke 1:42-45).

Mary then prays the [Magnificat](/liturgy/chants/magnificat), which begins with, “My soul magnifies the Lord” (Luke 1:46). She thanks God for His grace and mercy, and for exalting the humble.

When Jesus was on the cross, he told Mary, who was standing near [St. John](/people/saints/john), "Woman, behold, your son!" (John 19:26), and he said to John, "Behold, your mother!" (John 19:27).
