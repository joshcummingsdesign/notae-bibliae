<Initial text="Peter Lombard" />

[Peter Lombard](/glossary/names#peter) (1096–1160) was born in Lumellogno in the Lombardy region of northwestern Italy, to a poor family. His education most likely began in Italy at the cathedral schools of Novara and Lucca and at the University of Bologna. The patronage of Odo, Bishop of Lucca, who recommended him to [St. Bernard of Clairvaux](/people/saints/medieval/bernard-of-clairvaux), allowed him to leave Italy and further his studies at Reims and Paris.

In Paris, where he spent the next decade teaching at the cathedral school of Notre-Dame de Paris (French: Our Lady of Paris), he came into contact with Peter Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor, who were among the leading theologians of the time. In 1142, he became recognized as a teacher and writer, and around 1145, he became a professor at the cathedral school of Notre Dame in Paris.

Lombard's style of teaching gained quick acknowledgment. He was considered a celebrated theologian by 1144. The Parisian school of canons had not included among their number a theologian of high regard for some years. Peter had no relatives, ecclesiastical connections, or political ties in France, and seems to have achieved such status based solely on his academic merit.

He became a subdeacon in 1147, and attended the Council of Rheims in 1148. In the 1150s, Peter became a deacon, archdeacon, and was ultimately ordained as a priest.

Following in the tradition of figures like [St. Isidore of Seville](/people/saints/latin-fathers/isidore-of-seville), Peter began work on a theological compendium: the *Four Books of <Definition lang="latin" anchor="sententia" text="Sentences" />*. He collected glosses from the Church Fathers, arranged them with material from the Bible, and compiled them into one coherent whole. The *Sentences* covered virtually the entire field of Christian theology as it was understood at the time.

By 1154, he had completed an initial version of the text which he read to his students in Paris during the 1156–1157 academic year. The following term, he had significantly revised the *Sentences*, and this became the definitive version. The first major manuscript of the *Sentences* was copied in 1158. There are nearly 900 extant manuscripts of Lombard's work, which indicates how widely it was used. In it, Peter relied heavily on the works of [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo), citing him over 1,000 times.

The *Sentences* formed the framework upon which four centuries of scholastic interpretation of Western Christian dogma was based, and it went on to become the standard textbook of theology in the medieval universities, for which Peter earned the accolade *Magister Sententiarum* (Latin: Master of the Sentences).

From the 1220s until the 16th century, no work of Christian literature, except for the Bible itself, was commented upon more frequently. Even [St. Thomas Aquinas'](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas) *Summa Theologiae*, written in the 13th century, would not eclipse the *Sentences* in importance until around the 16th century. All the major medieval thinkers in western Europe, from Thomas Aquinas to [William of Ockham](/people/scholars/william-of-ockham), were influenced by it. Even the young Martin Luther still wrote glosses on the Sentences, and John Calvin quoted from it over 100 times in his *Institutes*.

On July 28, 1159—on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul—Peter Lombard was consecrated Bishop of Paris. Lombard's time as bishop was brief, as he died in 1160 in Paris.
