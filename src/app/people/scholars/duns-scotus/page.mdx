<Initial text="Duns Scotus" />

[John Duns Scotus](/glossary/names#john) (1265 – 1308) was from the town of Duns in Berwickshire, Scotland (*Soctus* is Latin for "of Scotland"). A [Franciscan](/people/saints/medieval/francis-of-assisi) friar, he was educated at a *<Definition lang="latin"anchor="studium-generale" text="studium generale" />* in Oxford, England. He was ordained as a priest at St Andrew's, Northampton, England, in 1291.

Scotus' great work is his commentary on [Peter Lombard's](/people/scholars/peter-lombard) *Sentences*. Scotus' commentary contains nearly all the philosophical views and arguments for which he is well known, such as the univocity of being (that existence is the most abstract concept we have, applicable to everything that exists), the formal distinction (a way of distinguishing between different formalities of the same thing), the idea of haecceity (the property supposed to be in each individual thing that makes it an individual, i.e. a certain "thisness"), and his renowned argument from contingency for the existence of God.

In around 1302, Scotus began lecturing on the *Sentences* at the prestigious University of Paris. Soon after, however, he was expelled for siding with Pope Boniface VIII in his feud with King Philip IV of France over the taxation of church property. In around 1304, Scotus returned to the University of Paris and continued lecturing there until around 1307, when he was dispatched to the Franciscan *studium* in Cologne, Germany. He died unexpectedly in Cologne on November 8, 1308.

Duns Scotus was long regarded as a Blessed by the Franciscan Order and by the Archdioceses of Edinburgh, Scotland and Cologne, Germany. He was officially beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1993. He is one of the four most important Christian philosopher-theologians of Western Europe in the High Middle Ages, together with [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas), [St. Bonaventure](/people/saints/medieval/bonaventure-of-bagnoregio) and [William of Ockham](/people/scholars/william-of-ockham).
