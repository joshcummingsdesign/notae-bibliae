<Initial text="Clement of Alexandria" />

[Clement of Alexandria](/glossary/names#clement) (150–215 AD) grew up in a pagan family and converted to Christianity. The place of his birth is uncertain, but is perhaps Athens or Alexandria. He was an educated man who was familiar with classical Greek philosophy and literature. After his conversion, he traveled in Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine, and Egypt. In around 180 AD, Clement reached Alexandria, where he met Pantaenus, a Greek theologian who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. Clement studied under Pantaenus, and was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Julian before 189 AD. Clement later began to teach at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. [Origen](/people/scholars/origen) was one of his pupils.

Three of Clement's major works have survived in full and they are collectively referred to as a trilogy: *Protrepticus* (Greek: Προτρεπτικὸς, "Exhortation") (c. 195 AD), *Paedagogus* (Greek: Παιδαγωγός, "Tutor") (c. 198 AD), and *Stromata* (Greek: Στρωματεῖς, *Stromateis*, "Miscellanies") (c. 198–203 AD). These works demonstrate that Clement was influenced by Hellenistic philosophy to a greater extent than any other Christian thinker of his time, and in particular, by Plato and the Stoics.

*Protrepticus* serves as a philosophical and theological invitation to non-Christians, urging them to embrace the Christian faith. It is a form of apologetic dialogue where Clement presents Christianity as the fulfillment of true philosophy. The work emphasizes the superiority of Christian teachings over the philosophies of ancient Greece, particularly those of the Stoics and Platonists. Clement encourages the reader to abandon false idol worship and the distractions of materialism, advocating for the pursuit of true knowledge and virtue found in Christ. The book also highlights the compatibility between faith and reason, aiming to show that Christianity is not a rejection of philosophy but its completion and perfection. Ultimately, *Protrepticus* is both a call to conversion and a defense of Christian philosophy in a pagan world.

*Paedagogus* is a treatise that offers guidance on Christian ethics and behavior, focusing on how believers should live in accordance with the teachings of Christ. The work is structured as a series of instructions on various aspects of Christian life, including morality, discipline, and spiritual formation. Clement presents Christ as the ultimate *"Paedagogus"* or "Tutor", whose example and teachings should guide the believer in all areas of life, from personal conduct to relationships with others. The book covers topics such as the proper use of wealth, the role of marriage, the importance of self-control, and the rejection of pagan practices. Clement also emphasizes the need for Christians to distinguish themselves from the surrounding pagan culture, not through withdrawal, but through living lives of virtue and piety. Paedagogus serves as both a practical guide for Christian living and a theological reflection on the transformative power of the Christian faith.

*Stromata* is a vast and complex work that explores a wide range of topics, blending Christian theology with philosophy, ethics, and various forms of knowledge. It consists of multiple books (often divided into eight), each addressing different themes and providing a comprehensive view of Christian life and thought. Clement's aim is to show that Christianity is the true and complete philosophy, and that it can harmonize with, and even fulfill, the best of ancient Greco-Roman intellectual traditions.

[Eusebius](/people/scholars/eusebius) called Clement "an incomparable master of Christian philosophy." [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) called him "the most learned of men," recording that his writings are "full of eloquence and learning, both in sacred Scripture and in secular literature." [St. Cyril of Alexandria](/people/saints/greek-fathers/cyril-of-alexandria) said that Clement was "a man admirably learned and skillful, and one that searched to the depths all the learning of the Greeks, with an exactness rarely attained before."

Although Clement of Alexandria was one of the earliest and most influential Christian scholars, known for his systematic approach to Christian doctrine, some of his views have been the subject of debate over time. His allegorical interpretation of Scripture, certain Gnostic influences, and perspectives on Christian perfection and the nature of Christ have occasionally raised theological questions. Clement was venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church until the 17th century, however, when the Roman Martyrology was revised by Pope Clement VIII, his feast was removed from the liturgical calendar following the advice of Cardinal Baronius. Pope Benedict XIV later confirmed this decision in the 18th century.
