<Initial text="Tertullian" />

[Tertullian](/glossary/names#tertullian) (155–220 AD) was from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa (modern Tunisia). He was a scholar with an excellent education. From his writings we can ascertain that he converted to Christianity in his thirties. His conversion appears to have been sudden, decisive, and transformative. He writes that he could not imagine a truly Christian life without such a radical act of conversion, saying, "Christians are made, not born." It is also evident that he was married to a Christian wife.

Tertullian was the first Christian author to produce an extensive corpus of Latin Christian literature, and was an early Christian apologist and a polemicist against heresy. Tertullian was the first theologian to write in Latin, and so has been called "the father of Latin Christianity", as well as "the founder of Western theology". His writings cover a broad range of theological topics, including apologetics, polemics, church polity, discipline, and Christian morals. His writings provide valuable insight into the religious life and thought of his time.

Tertullian contributed significantly to the development of Trinitarian theology, being the first writer in Latin to use the term *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="trinitas" text="Trinitas" />*, and describing God as one substance in three persons. While his formulations were not identical to later Nicene orthodoxy, they laid important groundwork. He also emphasized the dual nature of Christ (fully divine and fully human) and argued against heretical views such as Marcionism (the God of the Old Testament is a lesser deity distinct from the God revealed by Christ), Gnosticism (the material world is evil, and "secret" knowledge is the path to salvation), and Monarchianism (a view that rejects the Trinity and sees God as a singular divine monarch).

Tertullian wrote numerous apologetic works defending Christianity against Roman persecution and pagan criticism. His works, such as *Apologeticus*, defended Christians' right to practice their faith, and addressed accusations of immorality and disloyalty to the Roman state.

Tertullian was known for his rigorous ethical standards and asceticism. He strongly emphasized moral discipline, personal piety, and separation from the corrupt influences of the secular world. This rigorism influenced later Christian practices and attitudes, especially in the monastic tradition.

Tertullian's legacy as a foundational figure in the development of Christian theology and Western thought is undeniable. His writings influenced later Christian thinkers, including [St. Cyprian](/people/saints/latin-fathers/cyprian-of-carthage), [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo), and even Reformers such as John Calvin. His influence remains evident in the development of Christian doctrine and thought, shaping the theological discussions that followed.
