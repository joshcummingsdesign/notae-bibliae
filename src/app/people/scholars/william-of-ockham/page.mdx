<Initial text="William of Ockham" />

[William of Ockham](/glossary/names#william) (1287–1347) was born in Ockham, Surrey (southeast England). A [Franciscan](/people/saints/medieval/francis-of-assisi) friar, he received his elementary education in the London House of the Greyfriars. He then studied theology at the University of Oxford from 1309 to 1321.

William was a scholastic philosopher, and produced significant works on theology, logic, and physics. Ockham believed that scholastic philosophy had become too complex and burdened with unnecessary details. His primary goal was to simplify philosophical and theological arguments, cutting out what he saw as superfluous or overly-complex. This way of reasoning came to be known as Ockham's razor. The origins of Ockham's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as [Duns Scotus](/people/scholars/duns-scotus) and even Aristotle, but its fame and its association with him may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it. Ockham's razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, and both hypotheses have equal explanatory power, one should prefer the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions.

William was deeply influenced by the scholastic theologian Duns Scotus, adopting many of his ideas on divine omnipotence, grace and justification, as well as aspects of his epistemology and ethical beliefs. However, William disagreed with Scotus on certain points, particularly regarding predestination and penance.

William was a proponent of nominalism, the view that universals and abstract objects do not actually exist other than being merely names or labels. He also argued that faith is necessary for grasping theological truths, which go beyond what reason can comprehend.

During the Middle Ages, [Peter Lombard's](/people/scholars/peter-lombard) *Sentences* (a compendium written by the 12th century Italian scholastic theologian and Bishop of Paris) had become a standard work of theology, and many ambitious theological scholars wrote commentaries on it. William was among these scholarly commentators. His commentary, however, was condemned as containing doctrinal errors, leading to his summoning to Avignon, France to defend himself before the papal court.

At the same time, William had become deeply involved in the theological debate about apostolic poverty, which was a central issue for the Franciscans. The Franciscans believed that Jesus and the apostles owned no property either individually or in common. The *Rule of Saint Francis*, for example, instructed members of the order to follow this practice. Pope John XXII vehemently opposed the Franciscans, deeming their views on apostolic poverty as heretical. Because of this, William and other leading Franciscans fled Avignon in 1328, and eventually took refuge in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV of Bavaria. It was there that William wrote many treatises against unlimited papal authority. In 1328, William was officially excommunicated for leaving Avignon without permission.

He spent much of the remainder of his life writing about political issues, including the relative authority and rights of the spiritual and temporal powers. In 1342, he became the leader of the small band of Franciscan dissidents living in exile with Louis IV, and died shortly after in 1347.

William of Ockham stands as one of the most influential philosophers of the Late Middle Ages, alongside figures such as [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas) and Duns Scotus. His significant contributions shaped not only metaphysics but also logic, natural philosophy, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and theology, cementing his status as a key thinker of his time.
