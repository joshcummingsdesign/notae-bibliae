<Initial text="Eusebius" />

[Eusebius of Caesarea](/glossary/names#eusebius) (250–339 AD) was born in or around Caesarea Maritima (modern northwestern Israel). He was baptized and instructed there, lived there when when Diocletian's army passed through the region in 296, and was later made presbyter.

Through the efforts of theologian [Origen](/people/scholars/origen) and his follower Pamphilus, Caesarea became a hub of Christian learning. Origen played a key role in gathering information about which churches used specific gospel texts, shaping the formation of the New Testament. This data influenced Eusebius' *Ecclesiastical History*, which informed the late 4th-century Easter Letter (one of a series of letters by which the bishops of Alexandria announced the date on which Easter was to be celebrated) that defined accepted Christian writings. Eusebius relied on Origen's library, writings, and firsthand knowledge from his extensive travels to compile his lists of authoritative texts.

On his deathbed, Origen had made a bequest of his private library to the Christian community in the city. Origen's library formed the core of the collection that Pamphilus established. Pamphilus also managed a school that was similar to that of Origen.

In the 280s, Pamphilus settled in Caesarea, and Eusebius became his student. Because of his close relationship with his schoolmaster, Eusebius was sometimes called "Eusebius, son of Pamphilus". Pamphilus gave Eusebius a strong admiration for the thought of Origen. Soon after joining Pamphilus' school, Eusebius started helping his master expand the library's collections and broaden access to its resources. At about this time Eusebius compiled a *Collection of Ancient Martyrdoms*, presumably for use as a general reference tool.

In the 290s, Eusebius began work on his most important work, the *Ecclesiastical History*, a narrative history of the Church and Christian community from the Apostolic Age to Eusebius' own time. At about the same time, he worked on his *Chronicle*, a universal calendar of events from creation to Eusebius' own time. He completed the first editions of the *Ecclesiastical History* and *Chronicle* before 300.

In around 313, Eusebius became Bishop of Caesarea. During his time as bishop, Arius, who had been excommunicated by Alexander, the Bishop of Alexandria, sought Eusebius' support. An episcopal council held in Caesarea cleared Arius of any wrongdoing. Eusebius was favored by Emperor Constantine, which led to his significant role at the Council of Nicaea in 325. There, he presented the creed of his church to the 318 attendees. However, the anti-Arian creed prevailed, becoming the basis for the Nicene Creed.

In 335, [St. Athanasius](/people/saints/greek-fathers/athanasius-of-alexandria) was summoned before a synod in Tyre for his Nicene faith, at which Eusebius of Caesarea presided. Athanasius, foreseeing the result, went to Constantinople to bring his cause before the Emperor. Constantine called the bishops to his court, among them Eusebius. Athanasius was condemned and exiled. This was one of five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors Athanasius faced for his Nicene faith.

After the Emperor's death in around 337, Eusebius wrote the *Life of Constantine*, an important historical work because of eyewitness accounts and the use of primary sources.

Eusebius is regarded as one of the most learned Christians during late antiquity. He wrote the *Demonstrations of the Gospel*, *Preparations for the Gospel* and *On Discrepancies between the Gospels*, and many other studies of the biblical text. His work *Onomasticon* (Greek: ὀνομαστικόν, "of names") is an early geographical lexicon of places in the Holy Land mentioned in the Bible. Eusebius is sometimes called "the Father of Church History".
