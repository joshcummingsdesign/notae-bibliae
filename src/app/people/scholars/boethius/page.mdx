<Initial text="Boethius" />

[Boethius](/glossary/names#boethius) (480–524 AD) was born in Rome to a wealthy Christian family. Odoacer, a Germanic military leader, led a revolt and deposed the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476. Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, overthrew Odoacer in 493. Boethius' father, a patrician named Manlius Boethius, died while Boethius was still young, and Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, another patrician, adopted and raised him, introducing to him philosophy and literature.

At a young age, Boethius achieved a mastery of the Greek language, an increasingly rare skill in the Western regions of the Roman Empire. Boethius' writings were a precursor to the scholastic movement, and he became one of the leading Christian scholars of the 6th century. In seeking to reconcile the teachings of Plato and Aristotle with Christian theology, Boethius sought to translate the entirety of the Greek classics for Western scholars. He published numerous transcriptions and commentaries of the works of Nicomachus, Porphyry, and Cicero, among others, and wrote extensively on matters concerning music, mathematics, and theology. It is largely due to Boethius' translations that the works of Aristotle survived into the Renaissance.

Taking inspiration from Plato's *Republic*, Boethius left his scholarly pursuits to enter the service of Theodoric the Great. In the next few years, Boethius rapidly ascended through the ranks of government, becoming a senator by age 25 and a consul by the year 510. In 522, both of his sons were selected by Theodoric to be consuls, and Boethius was elevated to the position of *magister officiorum*, becoming the head of all government and palace affairs.

Despite his successes as a senior official, Boethius became deeply unpopular among other members of the Ostrogothic court for denouncing the extensive corruption prevalent among other members of government. After publicly defending fellow consul Caecina Albinus from charges of conspiracy, he was imprisoned by Theodoric around the year 523. While in prison, Boethius wrote his great work *On the Consolation of Philosophy*, a philosophical treatise which reflects on the nature of happiness and God, how evil can exist in a world governed by God, and how happiness is still attainable amidst trials. It became one of the most influential and widely reproduced works of the Early Middle Ages.

Boethius was tortured and executed in 524. He is regarded as a Christian martyr.
