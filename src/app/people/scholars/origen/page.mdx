<Initial text="Origen" />

Almost all information about the life of [Origen of Alexandria](/glossary/names#origen) (185–253 AD) comes from Book VI of the *Ecclesiastical History* written by the Christian historian [Eusebius](/people/scholars/eusebius) (260 – 340 AD). Origen was born in Alexandria (the famous Greek city in Egypt founded by Alexander the Great which fell under Roman control), and was the eldest of nine children. Origen was educated in Greek literature. His father, Leonides of Alexandria, was a respected professor of literature and also a devout Christian who practiced his religion openly. Origen's father made him memorize passages of scripture daily.

In 202, when Origen was not yet seventeen, the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus ordered Roman citizens who openly practiced Christianity to be executed. Origen's father Leonides was arrested, thrown in prison, and executed. The state confiscated the family's entire property, leaving them impoverished, and Origen was left to provide for his whole family.

When he was eighteen years old, Origen was appointed as a catechist at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. While employed at the school, he adopted the ascetic lifestyle of the Greek <Definition lang="greek" anchor="sophos" text="Sophists"/>. He spent the whole day teaching and would stay up late at night writing treatises and commentaries. He went barefoot and only owned one cloak. He did not drink alcohol and ate a simple diet and he often fasted for long periods. It was around this time that Origen succeeded in converting a wealthy man named Ambrose from Gnosticism to orthodox Christianity. Ambrose was so impressed by the young scholar that he gave Origen a house, a secretary, seven stenographers, a crew of copyists and calligraphers, and paid for all of his writings to be published.

Sometime when he was in his early twenties, Origen sold the small library of Greek literary works which he had inherited from his father in order to continue his study of the Bible and of philosophy. He studied at numerous schools throughout Alexandria, including the Platonic Academy of Alexandria. He resigned his position as catechist, and became highly influential in the realm of Christian philosophy. His influence brought him into conflict with Demetrius, the Bishop of Alexandria, who became the most direct promoter of the elevation in status of the Bishop of Alexandria. It was around this time that Origen began composing his massive theological treatise *On the First Principles* (Greek: Περὶ Ἀρχῶν, *Peri Archon*) (Latin: *De Principiis*), a landmark book which systematically laid out the foundations of Christian theology for centuries to come.

In 212 Origen traveled to Rome. There, he attended lectures by [St. Hippolytus](/people/saints/early/hippolytus-of-rome), and was influenced by his <Definition lang="greek" anchor="logos" text="Logos" /> theology. Soon after, the governor of Arabia sent a message to the prefect of Egypt requesting him to send Origen to meet with him so that he could interview him and learn more about Christianity from its leading intellectual. Origen, escorted by official bodyguards, spent a short time in Arabia with the governor before returning to Alexandria.

In the autumn of 215 the Roman Emperor Caracalla visited Alexandria. During the visit, the students at the schools there protested and made fun of him for having murdered his brother Geta. Caracalla, incensed, ordered his troops to ravage the city, execute the governor, and kill all the protesters. He also commanded them to expel all the teachers and intellectuals from the city. Origen fled Alexandria and traveled to the city of Caesarea Maritima in the Roman province of Palestine, where the bishops Theoctistus of Caesarea and Alexander of Jerusalem became his devoted admirers and asked him to deliver discourses on the scriptures in their respective churches. This effectively amounted to letting Origen deliver homilies, even though he was not formally ordained. While this was an unexpected phenomenon, especially given Origen's international fame as a teacher and philosopher, it infuriated Demetrius, who saw it as a direct undermining of his authority. Demetrius sent deacons from Alexandria to demand that the Palestinian hierarchs immediately return Origen to Alexandria. He also issued a decree chastising the Palestinians for allowing a person who was not ordained to preach. The Palestinian bishops, in turn, issued their own condemnation, accusing Demetrius of being jealous of Origen's fame and prestige.

Origen obeyed Demetrius' order and returned to Alexandria, bringing with him an antique scroll he had purchased at Jericho containing the full text of the Hebrew Bible. The manuscript, which had purportedly been found in a jar, became the source text for one of the two Hebrew columns in Origen's *Hexapla* (Greek: Ἑξαπλᾶ, "sixfold", a critical edition of the Hebrew Bible in six versions, four of them translated into Greek, preserved only in fragments).

Origen heavily studied the New Testament, especially the epistles of the apostle Paul and the Gospel of John, the writings which Origen regarded as the most important and authoritative. At Ambrose's request, Origen composed the first five books of his exhaustive *Commentary on the Gospel of John*, He also wrote the first eight books of his *Commentary on Genesis*, his *Commentary on Psalms 1–25*, and his *Commentary on Lamentations*. In addition to these commentaries, Origen also wrote two books on the resurrection of Jesus and ten books of *Stromata* (miscellanies).

Origen repeatedly asked Demetrius to ordain him as a priest, but Demetrius continually refused. In around 231, Demetrius sent Origen on a mission to Athens. Along the way, Origen stopped in Caesarea, where he was warmly greeted by the bishops Theoctistus of Caesarea and Alexander of Jerusalem, who had become his close friends during his previous stay. While he was visiting Caesarea, Origen asked Theoctistus to ordain him as a priest. Theoctistus gladly complied. Upon learning of Origen's ordination, Demetrius was outraged and issued a condemnation declaring that Origen's ordination by a foreign bishop was an act of insubordination. Demetrius raised a storm of protests against the bishops of Palestine and the church synod in Rome. Demetrius died in 232, less than a year after Origen's departure from Alexandria.

During his early years in Caesarea, Origen's primary task was the establishment of a Christian School; Caesarea had long been seen as a center of learning for Jews and Hellenistic philosophers, but until Origen's arrival, it had lacked a Christian center of higher education. According to Eusebius, the school Origen founded was primarily targeted towards young pagans who had expressed interest in Christianity but were not yet ready to ask for baptism. The school therefore sought to explain Christian teachings through Middle Platonism. Origen started his curriculum by teaching his students classical Socratic reasoning. After they had mastered this, he taught them cosmology and natural history. Finally, once they had mastered all of these subjects, he taught them theology, which was the highest of all philosophies, the accumulation of everything they had previously learned.

With the establishment of the Caesarean school, Origen's reputation as a scholar and theologian reached its zenith and he became known throughout the Mediterranean world as a brilliant intellectual. The hierarchs of the Palestinian and Arabian church synods regarded Origen as the ultimate expert on all matters dealing with theology. While teaching in Caesarea, Origen resumed work on his *Commentary on John*, composing at least books six through ten. In the first of these books, Origen compares himself to "an Israelite who has escaped the perverse persecution of the Egyptians." Origen also wrote the treatise *On Prayer* at the request of his friend Ambrose and Tatiana (referred to as the "sister" of Ambrose), in which he analyzes the different types of prayers described in the Bible and offers a detailed exegesis on the Lord's Prayer.

In 235, approximately three years after Origen began teaching in Caesarea, Alexander Severus, who had been tolerant towards Christians, was murdered and Emperor Maximinus Thrax instigated a purge of all those who had supported his predecessor. His pogroms targeted Christian leaders and, in Rome, Pope Pontianus and Hippolytus of Rome were both sent into exile. Origen knew that he was in danger and went into hiding in the home of a faithful Christian woman named Juliana the Virgin, who had been a student of the Ebionite (Hebrew: "poor ones", a Jewish Christian sect during the Common Era which viewed poverty as a blessing) leader Symmachus. Origen's close friend and longtime patron Ambrose was arrested in Nicomedia (northwestern Asia Minor), and Protoctetes, the leading priest in Caesarea, was also arrested. In their honor, Origen composed his treatise *Exhortation to Martyrdom*, which is now regarded as one of the greatest classics of Christian resistance literature. After coming out of hiding following Maximinus' death, Origen founded a school of which Gregory Thaumaturgus, who later became Bishop of Pontus (modern nothern Turkey), was one of the pupils. Origen preached regularly on Wednesdays and Fridays, and later daily.

Sometime between 238 and 244, Origen visited Athens, where he completed his *Commentary on the Book of Ezekiel* and began writing his *Commentary on the Song of Songs*. After visiting Athens, he visited Ambrose in Nicomedia. During his travels, he met Plotinus, the founder of Neoplatonism. The Christians of the eastern Mediterranean continued to revere Origen as the most orthodox of all theologians, and when the Palestinian hierarchs learned that Beryllus, the Bishop of Bostra (southern Syria) and one of the most energetic Christian leaders of the time, had been preaching adoptionism (the belief that Jesus was born human and only became divine after his baptism), they sent Origen to convert him to orthodoxy.

In around 249, the Plague of Cyprian broke out. In 250, Emperor Decius, believing that the plague was caused by Christians' failure to recognize him as divine, issued a decree for Christians to be persecuted. This time Origen did not escape. The governor of Caesarea gave very specific orders that Origen was not to be killed until he had publicly renounced his faith in Christ. Origen endured two years of imprisonment and torture, but obstinately refused to renounce his faith. In June 251, Decius was killed fighting the Goths in the Battle of Abritus (modern northeastern Bulgaria), and Origen was released from prison. Nonetheless, Origen's health was broken by the physical tortures enacted on him, and he died less than a year later at the age of sixty-nine.

Origen was a highly-influential Christian theologian, especially in the East. Argument over the orthodoxy of Origen's teachings spawned the First Origenist Crisis in the late 4th century, in which he was attacked by [St. Epiphanius](/people/saints/early/epiphanius-of-salamis) and [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon). In 543, Emperor Justinian I condemned him as a heretic and ordered all his writings to be burned. The Second Council of Constantinople in 553 condemned his teachings on universalism and the pre-existence of souls.
