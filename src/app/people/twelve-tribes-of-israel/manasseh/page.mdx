<Initial text="Manasseh" />

[Manasseh](/glossary/names#manasseh) is the first son of [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) (Gen. 41:51). [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob) blesses him and his brother [Ephraim](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/ephraim), and says they will be counted as his own in the inheritance (Gen. 48:5). He places his right hand on Ephraim, even though he was the younger, to prophetically proclaim that he would be the greater (Joshua descends from the line of Ephraim) (Gen. 48:14). It is likely that he dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt) and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with Joseph and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
