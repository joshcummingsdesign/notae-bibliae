[Benjamin](/glossary/names#benjamin) is the twelfth son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob), but the second son of Jacob and Rachel.

Rachel had a hard labor, and as she is dying, she names him Ben-oni (בֶּן־אוֹנִי, "son of my sorrow"), but Jacob calls him Benjamin (בִּנְיָמִין, "son of the right hand") (Gen. 35:18). Rachel dies right after his birth (Gen. 35:19).

Jacob compares Benjamin to a ravenous wolf (Gen. 49:27). His line includes Saul and his son Jonathan. His land would go on to include [Jerusalem](/places/old-testament/genesis/jerusalem). Benjamin dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
