[Joseph](/glossary/names#joseph) is the eleventh son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob), but the first son of Jacob and Rachel (Gen 30:24). His line includes [Manasseh](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/manasseh) and [Ephraim](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/ephraim).

All of Joseph's brothers, except for [Reuben](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/reuben) (and [Benjamin](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/benjamin) who is too young), sell him as a slave to the Ishmaelites who take him to [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt) (Gen. 37:27-29). After interpreting Pharaoh's dreams about a famine (Gen. 41:28-32), he is raised to second in command (Gen. 41:40), given the name Zaphenath-paneah (Egyptian: One to whom hidden things are revealed), and given an Egyptian wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On (modern Heliopolis, Egypt) (Gen. 41:45).

Jacob blesses his sons Manasseh and Ephraim, and says they will be counted as his own in the inheritance (Gen. 48:5). He places his right hand on Ephraim, even though he was the younger, to prophetically proclaim that he would be the greater (Joshua descends from his line) (Gen. 48:14). He then gives Joseph a double portion of the inheritance in the land near [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem), and prophesies that it will be taken from the Amorites as God had promised (Gen. 48:21-22). Jacob blesses him and says that he will be fruitful (Ephraim means "fruitful") (Gen. 49:22), and that despite his trials, God's blessing will be over him (Gen. 49:23-26).

As Joseph is about to die, he prophesies that God will visit Israel and bring them up out of Egypt to the promised land (Gen. 50:24). He makes his brothers promise to carry his bones up from out of Egypt (Gen. 50:25). Joseph dies in Egypt, and Moses carries his bones out of Egypt to fulfill the promise (Ex. 13:19). When the Israelites enter the land, his bones are carried to Shechem and he is buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32).
