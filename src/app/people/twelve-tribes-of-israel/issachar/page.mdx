[Issachar](/glossary/names#issachar) is the ninth son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob), but the fifth son of Jacob and Leah (Gen 30:18). Although he was the ninth son, Jacob gives him the sixth blessing. In his blessing, Jacob prophesies that he would dwell in fertile land and be agriculturally strong (Gen. 49:14-15). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
