[Asher](/glossary/names#asher) is the eighth son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob), but the second son of Jacob and Leah's servant Zilpah (Gen. 30:12-13). Although he was the eighth son, Jacob gives him the ninth blessing. In his blessing, Jacob prophesies that his land and yield would be bountiful (Gen. 49:20). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
