[Simeon](/glossary/names#simeon) is the second son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob) and Leah (Gen. 29:33). Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, defiles Jacob's daughter Dinah (Gen. 34:1-2). Hamor speaks with Simeon and Levi and says that their peoples should intermarry (Gen. 34:7-9), and Simeon and [Levi](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/levi) deceitfully tell him they will agree if Hamor's house is circumcised (Gen. 34:13-15). After they are sore, Simeon and Levi come against the city and kill every male and plunder it (Gen. 34:25-29). Jacob is deeply troubled and confronts his sons for bringing trouble on him in the land of the Canaanites and Perizzites (Gen. 34:30). When [Joseph's](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) brothers come to [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), Simeon is bound and taken as collateral while the brothers return to get [Benjamin](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/benjamin) (Gen. 42:24). Jacob prophesies that Simeon would be scattered in Israel (Gen. 49:5-7), which was fulfilled when he received his inheritance out of the land of Judah, and his cities were scattered about (Josh. 19:1-9). He dies in Egypt, and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with Joseph and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
