<Initial text="Zebulun" />

[Zebulun](/glossary/names#zebulun) is the tenth son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob), but the sixth son of Jacob and Leah (Gen. 30:20). Although he was the tenth son, Jacob gives him the fifth blessing. In his blessing, Jacob prophesies that he would live by the sea, which was fulfilled when the tribe's land allotment placed them near both the [Sea of Galilee](/places/new-testament/matthew/sea-of-galilee) and the Mediterranean (Josh. 19:10–11). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
