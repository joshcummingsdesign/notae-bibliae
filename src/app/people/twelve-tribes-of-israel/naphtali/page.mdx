[Naphtali](/glossary/names#naphtali) is the sixth son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob), but the second son of Jacob and Rachel's servant Bilhah (Gen. 30:7-8). Although he was the sixth son, Jacob gives him the tenth blessing. In his blessing, Jacob compares him to a doe being set free to bear "beautiful words" (Gen. 49:21). His land allotment fell near the [Sea of Galilee](/places/new-testament/matthew/sea-of-galilee). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
