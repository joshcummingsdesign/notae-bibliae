<Initial text="Ephraim"/>

[Ephraim](/glossary/names#ephraim) is the second son of [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) (Gen. 41:52). [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob) blesses him and his brother [Manasseh](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/manasseh), and says they will be counted as his own in the inheritance (Gen. 48:5). He places his right hand on Ephraim, even though he was the younger, to prophetically proclaim that he would be the greater (Joshua descends from his line) (Gen. 48:14). He then gives Joseph a double portion of the inheritance in the land near [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem), and prophesies that it will be taken from the Amorites as God had promised (Gen. 48:21-22). Jacob blesses him and says that he will be fruitful (Ephraim means "fruitful") (Gen. 49:22), and that despite his trials, God's blessing will be over him (Gen. 49:23-26). It is likely that he dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt) and is carried to Shechem with Joseph and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
