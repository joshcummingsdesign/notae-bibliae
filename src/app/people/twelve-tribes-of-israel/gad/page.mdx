<Initial text="Gad" />

[Gad](/glossary/names#gad) is the seventh son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob), but the first son of Jacob and Leah's servant Zilpah (Gen. 30:10-11). Although he was the seventh son, Jacob gives him the eighth blessing. In his blessing, Jacob uses the word *g'dúd* (גדוד, "raiders") to say that raiders shall raid Gad, but that he shall overcome them when they retreat (Gen. 49:19). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
