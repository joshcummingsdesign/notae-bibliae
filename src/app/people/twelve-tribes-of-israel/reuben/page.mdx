[Reuben](/glossary/names#reuben) is the first son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob) and Leah (Gen. 29:32). Although he protected his brother [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) (Gen. 37:21), and his brother [Benjamin](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/benjamin) (Gen. 42:37), he lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine (Gen. 35:22), and thus forfeited his birthright (Gen. 49:3-4). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with Joseph and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
