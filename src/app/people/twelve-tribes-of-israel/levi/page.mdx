[Levi](/glossary/names#levi) is the third son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob) and Leah (Gen. 29:34). Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite defiles Jacob's daughter Dinah (Gen. 34:1-2). Hamor speaks with [Simeon](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/simeon) and Levi and says that their peoples should intermarry (Gen. 34:7-9), and Simeon and Levi deceitfully tell him they will agree if Hamor's house is circumcised (Gen. 34:13-15). After they are sore, Simeon and Levi come against the city and kill every male and plunder it (Gen. 34:25-29). Jacob is deeply troubled and confronts his sons for bringing trouble on him in the land of the Canaanites and Perizzites (Gen. 34:30). Jacob prophesies that Levi would be scattered in Israel (Gen. 49:5-7), which was fulfilled when he received no inheritance in the land (Num. 18:20). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16). His line includes Moses and Aaron.
