<Initial text="Dan"/>

[Dan](/glossary/names#dan) is the fifth son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob), but the first son of Jacob and Rachel's servant Bilhah (Gen. 30:1-5). He is initially named Dan because Rachel was thanking God for his righteous judgement in giving her a son when she was unable to have one (Gen. 30:6). Although he was the fifth son, Jacob gives him the seventh blessing. In his blessing, Jacob uses his name to signify that although he was the son of Rachel's servant, he would be a judge along with the other tribes of Israel (Gen. 49:16). Jacob also prophesies that Dan would be "a serpent in the way" (Gen. 49:17). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16). Samson comes from his line.
