<Initial text="Judah" />

[Judah](/glossary/names#judah) is the fourth son of [Jacob](/people/patriarchs/jacob) and Leah (Gen. 29:35). Judah convinces his brothers to sell [Joseph](/people/twelve-tribes-of-israel/joseph) to the Ishmaelites (Gen. 37:26-27). Judah takes a Canaanite wife named Shua (Gen. 38:2-3). After her death (Gen. 38:12), he mistakes his widowed daughter-in-law as a prostitute and conceives Perez (Gen. 38:26-29). Jacob portrays Judah as a lion's cub growing into a mighty lion, and prophesies that kings and ultimately the Messiah will come forth from his line (Gen. 49:8-12). He dies in [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), and is carried to [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) with Joseph and buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16). His line includes David and Jesus.
