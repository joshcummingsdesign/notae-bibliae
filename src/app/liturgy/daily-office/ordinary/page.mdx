<Initial text="Daily Office: Ordinary" />

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="ordinarius" text="Ordinary" /> refers to the parts of the Daily Office that are generally unchanged regardless of the day or liturgical season.

## Before the Office
---

## Candles

According to the [Roman Rite](/liturgy/rites/roman-rite), six altar candles are lit for a solemn Office, and two for a simple Office, arranged symmetrically on either side of the crucifix. For private devotion, however, a single candle is appropriate.

Beeswax candles are the traditional candles used in Christian worship. The pure wax, produced by virgin worker bees, symbolizes the pure flesh of Christ, born of the Virgin Mary. The wick represents his soul, and the flame his divinity.[^1] Further parallels may be drawn between the candles and the Light of Christ (John 1:1-5), as well as the lamp that burned from evening to morning before the Lord in the tabernacle (Exodus 27:20-21).

## Silent Prayer

Before the Office, it is customary to kneel, make the [Sign of the Cross](/liturgy/prayers/sign-of-the-cross), and enter into silent prayer. The 15th-century [*Myroure of Our Ladye*](/meditations/silent-prayer-before-the-daily-office), written for the Bridgettine Sisters of Syon Abbey in West London, beautifully describes in more detail the purpose of kneeling in silent prayer as a way of preparing the heart and mind for the Office, and is well worth reading.

## Introductory Rites
---

## Opening Sentence

Ordinarily, the Officiant proceeds from the [sacristy](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sacristy) into the [chancel](/glossary/liturgical-terms#chancel), and all stand. The Officiant then bows or [genuflects](/glossary/liturgical-terms#genuflection) toward the altar and reads the Opening Sentence proper to the day.[^2] The Opening Sentence is the scriptural call to worship which sets the spiritual tone for the Office. A selection of Opening Sentences can be found in the Psalter (*<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Psalter" />*, abbreviated SDP).[^3] For private devotion, it is appropriate to simply read the Opening Sentence kneeling.

## General Confession

The General Confession then follows.[^4] Reciting the General Confession at Morning and Evening prayer reflects the ancient pattern of twice-daily confession at Prime and Compline.[^5] The General Confession is made up of three parts: the Exhortation, the Confession, and the Absolution. At the Exhortation, the congregation kneels, though one may already be kneeling during private devotion. Then, all recite the Confession. The Confession is an act of repentance in which we "with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need" (Heb. 4:16).

The 1530 *Augsburg Confession* describes repentance as consisting of two parts: contrition and faith. The former is defined as "terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin," and the latter is defined as "[belief] that for Christ's sake [one's] sins are forgiven," and that this belief "comforts the conscience and delivers it from terrors."[^6] Confession, therefore, is not merely remorse for sin, but trust that God, for Christ's sake, forgives us our sins and restores our conscience. Martin Luther's 1529 *Exhortation to Confession* articulates this profound relationship with remarkable clarity and warmth.

> "So notice then, that Confession, as I have often said, consists of two parts. The first is my own work and action, when I lament my sins and desire comfort and refreshment for my soul. The other part is a work that God does when he declares me free of my sin through his word placed in the mouth of a man. It is this splendid, noble, thing that makes Confession so lovely, so comforting."
>
> <cite>[Luther, Exhortation to Confession, 1529, par. 15](https://bookofconcord.org/other-resources/sources-and-context/exhortation-to-confession/)</cite>

After the Confession, the Absolution is given by the priest. If a priest is not present, the Collect for the Twenty-First Sunday After Trinity may be recited instead.[^7] Space here is given to meditate on the Gospel—that is, to desire comfort and refreshment for the soul, and to find it in Christ Jesus.

## Our Father

The [Our Father](/liturgy/prayers/our-father) immediately follows the General Confession and serves as a liturgical response to the Absolution.[^8] As the burning coal purified Isaiah’s lips, so the Absolution prepares the faithful to respond, “Here am I! Send me” (Isa. 6:6-8). Having been forgiven, we are thus able to pray with confidence, “Our Father.”

This order also harmonizes with the [Use of Sarum](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite), which states, "Before the beginning of the Hours, the Lord’s Prayer is always said...Whence Jerome, 'At the beginning of any work whatsoever, preface it with the Lord’s Prayer and the sign of the cross on the forehead, according to what is written: Before prayer, prepare thy soul for the Lord; and be not as a man that tempteth God' (Sir. 18:23)."[^9]

The [*Myroure of Our Ladye*](/meditations/the-lords-prayer-an-exposition-of-the-our-father) beautifully describes in more detail the rich meaning of the Our Father, and is well worth reading.

## Office Proper
---

## Opening Versicles

The Office Proper begins by standing for the Opening Versicles,[^10] which are here chanted according to the Roman Rite.[^11] A [versicle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#versicle) is a two or four-line verse sung in a call and response fashion. The Opening Versicles consist of the [*Domine labia mea*](/liturgy/music/chants/domine-labia-mea), the [*Deus in adjutorium*](/liturgy/music/chants/deus-in-adjutorium), and the [*Gloria Patri*](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri), and their use dates back to at least the 6th century, when they were prescribed in the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*.](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia)[^12] During the Opening Versicles, one is to make the Sign of the Cross on the lips with the right thumb when saying, "O Lord, open thou my lips," and a regular Sign of the Cross when saying, "O God, make speed to save me."[^13] It is also customary to bow toward the altar at the *Gloria Patri*.[^14] According to the ancient tradition, the *Alleluia* is omitted from Septuagesima to Easter Sunday (exclusive), and the Opening Versicles are omitted on the last three days of Holy Week and on All Souls' Day.[^15]

## Invitatory

The [Invitatory](/glossary/liturgical-terms/#invitatory)—Psalm 95, known by its Latin [incipit](/glossary/liturgical-terms#incipit) [*Venite exultemus Domino*](/liturgy/music/chants/venite)—follows the Opening Versicles.[^16] The use of the *Venite* in Christian worship dates back at least to the 4th century, when it was attested to by St. Augustine,[^17] and its use at [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins) was prescribed in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^18]

Chant tones and antiphons for the *Venite*, appointed for the seasons throughout the year, can be found in the Psalter. The Psalter includes two endings for the *Venite*. The first ending, taken from the Prayer Book, is drawn from Psalm 96. The second ending is translated directly from Psalm 95 and is therefore preferred.[^19]

According to the Prayer Book, the [*Pascha nostrum*](/liturgy/music/chants/pascha-nostrum) replaces the Venite during the [Octave of Easter](/glossary/liturgical-terms#octave);[^20] and by ancient precedent, the *Venite* is omitted on the last three days of Holy Week and on All Souls' Day.[^21]

## Psalms

After the Invitatory come the psalms appointed for the day.[^22] The proper posture for chanting the psalms is seated, as it is properly a meditation.[^23]

Antiphonal psalmody traces its origins to the Jewish Temple, and the early Christians continued on in the regular chanting of psalms.[^24] In the 6th century, the *Rule of Saint Benedict* outlined a seven-day psalter, so that by the end of each week all 150 Psalms would have been chanted—a task, Benedict notes, that his predecessors had accomplished within a single day.[^25] To make the Office more accessible to the laity, the 1549 Prayer Book adopted a monthly psalter, a feature still retained in the 1928 Prayer Book.[^26]

## First Lesson

Then comes the First Lesson from the Old Testament. Ordinarily, the [lector](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lector) stands, approaches the [lectern](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lectern), bows or genuflects toward the altar, and faces the seated congregation to read. Before beginning, the lector says, "Here beginneth the *nth* verse of the *nth* chapter of the Book of *N*." After the reading, the lector says, "Here endeth the *Nth* Lesson."[^27] For private devotion, however, it is appropriate to simply read the lesson seated.

When reading, one is encouraged to follow the monastic practice of *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="lectio-divina" text="Lectio Divina" />*: read, meditate, pray, and contemplate. For through contemplation, the Holy Spirit works faith in us to grow in wisdom and charity. And when we grow in wisdom in charity, we become a light to others. [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas) says, "For even as it is better to enlighten than merely to shine, so is it better to give to others the fruits of one's contemplation than merely to contemplate."[^28] This contemplation is nourished by Scripture, which reminds us, "Man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord" (Deut. 8:3).

## Te Deum

The First Lesson is followed by standing for the [*Te Deum*](/liturgy/music/chants/te-deum) at Morning Prayer.[^29] The *Te Deum*, also called the "Ambrosian Hymn," is an ancient hymn dating from the 4th century, or perhaps even earlier.[^30] In the 6th century, it was prescribed for Matins on Lord's Days in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^31] According to ancient precedent, the *Te Deum* is sung on the following occasions:

- **All Feasts and Lord's Days**
- **Daily during:**
  - Christmastide
  - Octave of Epiphany
  - Octave of Easter
  - Whitsuntide
- **Omitted during:**
  - Advent
  - Holy Innocents' Day, unless it falls on a Sunday
  - From Septuagesima to Passion Sunday (inclusive)
  - The Last Three Days of Holy Week
  - All Souls' Day[^32][^33]

### Old Testament Canticles

The Prayer Book gives the option to use the [*Benedicite*](/liturgy/music/chants/benedicite) in place of the *Te Deum*.[^34] This is because, historically, an [Old Testament Canticle](/liturgy/psalter#old-testament-canticles) was recited each day at [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds), and the *Benedicite* was appointed on Lord’s Days.[^35] In keeping with this tradition, this Office uses an Old Testament Canticle proper to the day when the *Te Deum* is not sung.

If one wishes to follow the Roman practice of singing the *Benedicite* together with the [*Facta est cum Angelo*](/liturgy/music/chants/facta-est-cum-angelo) on Christmas Day,[^36] the *Te Deum* may also be replaced on this occasion. Although they are technically sequences, the [*Victimae paschali laudes*](/liturgy/music/chants/victimae-paschali-laudes) and the [*Veni Sancte Spiritus*](/liturgy/music/chants/veni-sancte-spiritus) are also fitting choices to replace the *Te Deum* on Easter and Pentecost, respectively.

## Second Lesson

The Second Lesson from the New Testament follows the same rubrics as before.[^37]

## Gospel Canticles

[***Benedictus***](/liturgy/music/chants/benedictus)

*The Rule of Saint Benedict* prescribes a Gospel Canticle after the lessons at Lauds,[^38] and in 820 AD, Frankish Bishop Amalarius attested to the use of the *Benedictus* as this canticle.[^39] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places it after the Second Lesson at Morning Prayer.[^40] The proper posture for the *Benedictus*, and for all Gospel Canticles, is standing. It is also customary to make the Sign of the Cross before reciting the Gospel Canticles.[^41]

[***Magnificat***](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat)

*The Rule of Saint Benedict* prescribes a Gospel Canticle after the lesson at Vespers,[^42] and in 820 AD, Amalarius attested to the use of the *Magnificat* as this canticle.[^43] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places it after the First Lesson at Evening Prayer.[^44]

[***Nunc dimittis***](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis)

The Nunc dimittis has been used as an evening prayer since at least the 4th century, when it was included in the *Apostolic Constitutions*.[^45] In 820 AD, Amalarius attested to the use if the *Nunc dimittis* at [Compline](/glossary/liturgical-terms#compline).[^46] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places it after the Second Lesson at Evening Prayer.[^47]

## Concluding Rites
---

## Apostles' Creed

The Concluding Rites of the Office begin with the [Apostles' Creed](/liturgy/creeds/apostles-creed).[^48] The Apostles' Creed is one of the most enduring and widely used Christian confessions of faith, tracing its roots back to as early as the 2nd century. It developed from the Old Roman Creed, reaching its present form by the 8th century.[^49] It is customary to make the sign of the Cross at the end of the Apostles' Creed. [^50]

## Salutation

Following the Apostles' Creed, a priest or deacon recites the [Salutation](/glossary/liturgical-terms#salutation).[^51] If the Officiant is not a priest or a deacon, the following may be recited instead:

<Poetry>
|  \V O Lord, hear our prayer.
|  \R And let our cry come unto thee.
|  \V Let us pray.
</Poetry>

All kneel when the "Let us pray" is said.[^52]

## Suffrages

The Intercessions, or [Suffrages](/glossary/liturgical-terms#suffrages), then follow.[^53] According to the Roman Rite, the ancient practice of making intercessions at the end of the Office is meant to serve as an active response to St. Paul’s exhortation: “I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (1 Tim. 2:1–4).[^54]

## Collects

After the Suffrages come the [Collects](/glossary/liturgical-terms#collect),[^55] which according to the Psalter are chanted either using the [festal tone](/liturgy/daily-office/chant-rubrics#chanting-the-collect) or, on ferial days, *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="recto-tono" text="recto tono" />*.[^56]

The first Collect is always the proper one appointed for the Sunday or feast day. The last two Collects—for grace and for peace at Morning Prayer, and for grace and aid against perils at Evening Prayer—belong to the Ordinary. Other feasts and observances are sometimes commemorated after the first Collect.[^57]

All but five of the Collects are drawn from either the 1662 Prayer Book[^58] or the *<Definition lang="english" anchor="breviary-offices" text="Breviary Offices" />* (1874).[^59] The Collect for Saints Joachim and Anne comes from the [*Monastic Diurnal*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#monastic-diurnal) (1952);[^60] the Collects for Christ the King and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the commemoration of Thomas Cranmer, come from *<Definition lang="english" anchor="common-worship" text="Common Worship" />* (2000);[^61] and the commemoration of Martin Luther comes from *<Definition lang="english" anchor="lesser-feasts-and-fasts" text="Lesser Feasts and Fasts" />* (2024).[^62]

## Benedicamus

Then, according to the Roman Rite, the [*Benedicamus*](/liturgy/music/chants/benedicamus) is chanted.[^63] The *Benedicamus* has been used as a Closing Versicle in the Roman Rite since at least the 11th century.[^64]

## The Grace

Finally, the Grace is recited to conclude the Office.[^65] It is customary to make the Sign of the Cross at the Grace.[^66] The words of the Grace are taken from St. Paul's benediction at the end of his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (2 Cor. 13:14).

<Poetry>
|  The grace # of our Lord Jesus Christ,
|      and the love of God,
|      and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,
|          be with us all evermore. Amen.
</Poetry>

## After the Office
---

According to the Rule of Saint Benedict, whatever time remains after Morning Prayer is to be devoted to thoughtful study of the Psalms and Lessons.[^67] It is also appropriate to include here the study of the Church Fathers and the lives of the saints.
