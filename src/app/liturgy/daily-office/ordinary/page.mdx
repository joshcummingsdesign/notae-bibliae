<Initial text="Daily Office: Ordinary" />

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="ordinarius" text="Ordinary" /> refers to the parts of the Daily Office that are generally unchanged regardless of the day or liturgical season.

## Before the Office
---

## Candles

Two altar candles of pure wax are lit in preparation for the Office. Their light symbolizes Christ as the Light of the World (John 8:12); their number signifies his two natures, human and divine; and the pure wax reflects his holiness and purity.[^1]

## Silent Prayer

Before the Office, it is customary to make the [Sign of the Cross](/liturgy/prayers/sign-of-the-cross) and kneel in silent prayer. The 15th-century [*Myroure of Our Ladye*](/meditations/silent-prayer-before-the-daily-office), written for the Bridgettine Sisters of Syon Abbey in West London, beautifully describes in detail the purpose of kneeling in silent prayer as a way of preparing one's heart and mind for the Office.[^2]

## Introductory Rites
---

## Opening Sentence

The Introductory Rites of the Office begin with the reading of the Opening Sentence.[^3] The Opening Sentence is the scriptural call to worship which sets the spiritual tone for the Office. Ordinarily, the Officiant and other ministers proceed from the [sacristy](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sacristy) into the [chancel](/glossary/liturgical-terms#chancel), at which point all stand. The Officiant then bows or [genuflects](/glossary/liturgical-terms#genuflection) toward the altar and reads the Opening Sentence proper to the day.[^4] The selection of Opening Sentences used in this Office come from the Psalter (*<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Psalter" />*, abbreviated SDP).[^5]

## General Confession

The General Confession then follows.[^6] The General Confession is an act of repentance in which we "with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need" (Heb. 4:16). The 1530 [*Augsburg Confession*](/meditations/luther-on-repentance) beautifully describes in detail the meaning and purpose of repentance.[^7] Reciting the General Confession at Morning and Evening Prayer reflects the ancient practice of confessing twice daily, at [Prime](/glossary/liturgical-terms#prime) and [Compline](/glossary/liturgical-terms#compline).[^8]

First, the Exhortation is given, at which point the congregation kneels. Then, all recite the General Confession. After the General Confession, the Absolution is given by the priest. According to the Psalter, if a priest is not present, the [collect](/glossary/liturgical-terms#collect) for the Twenty-First Sunday After Trinity is recited instead.[^9] Space here is given to meditate on the Gospel—that is, to desire comfort and refreshment for the soul, and to find it in Christ Jesus.

## Our Father

The [Our Father](/liturgy/prayers/our-father) immediately follows the General Confession and serves as a liturgical response to the Absolution.[^10] As the burning coal purified Isaiah's lips, so the Absolution prepares the faithful to respond, "Here I am! Send me" (Isa. 6:6-8). Having been forgiven, we are thus able to pray with confidence, "Our Father."

This order also harmonizes with the [Use of Sarum](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite), which states, "Before the beginning of the [Hours](/glossary/liturgical-terms#liturgy-of-the-hours), the Lord's Prayer is always said...Whence [Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon), 'At the beginning of any work whatsoever, preface it with the Lord's Prayer and the Sign of the Cross on the forehead, according to what is written: Before prayer, prepare thy soul for the Lord; and be not as a man that tempteth God' (Sir. 18:23)."[^11]

The [*Myroure of Our Ladye*](/meditations/the-lords-prayer-an-exposition-of-the-our-father) beautifully describes in more detail the rich meaning of the Our Father.[^12] According to ancient precedent, the Sign of the Cross is made at the end of the Our Father.[^13]

## Office Proper
---

## Opening Versicles

The Office Proper begins by reciting the Opening Versicles.[^14] In the 6th century, the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) prescribed the [*Domine labia mea*](/liturgy/music/chants/domine-labia-mea) and the [*Deus in adjutorium*](/liturgy/music/chants/deus-in-adjutorium) as the [versicles](/glossary/liturgical-terms#versicle) used to open [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins). This was to be followed by the [*Gloria Patri*](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) and the [*Alleluia*](/liturgy/music/chants/alleluia). The *Domine labia mea* was to be omitted the other hours of the day, and the *Alleluia* was to be omitted during certain times of the year.[^15] The Prayer Book simplified these rubrics by using the *Domine labia mea* and the *Gloria Patri* for both Offices, and by replacing the *Alleluia* with the phrases "Praise ye the Lord" and "The Lord's name be praised."

According to ancient precedent, the Sign of the Cross is made on the lips with the right thumb when saying, "O Lord, open thou my lips." Unless the proper posture is seated, it is customary to bow toward the altar whenever reciting the *Groria Patri*.[^16] According to the Use of Sarum, the Opening Versicles are omitted the last three days of Holy Week and on All Souls' Day.[^17]

## Invitatory

At Morning Prayer, the [Invitatory](/glossary/liturgical-terms/#invitatory)—Psalm 95, known by its Latin [incipit](/glossary/liturgical-terms#incipit) [*Venite exultemus Domino*](/liturgy/music/chants/venite)—follows the Opening Versicles.[^18] The use of the *Venite* in Christian worship dates back to at least the 4th century, when it was attested to by [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo),[^19] and its use at Matins was prescribed in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^20]

Chant tones and [antiphons](/glossary/liturgical-terms#antiphon) for the *Venite*, appointed for the seasons throughout the year, can be found in the Psalter. The Psalter includes two endings for the *Venite*. The first ending, taken from the Prayer Book, is drawn from Psalm 96. The second ending comes directly from Psalm 95 and is therefore preferred.[^21]

According to the Prayer Book, the [*Pascha nostrum*](/liturgy/music/chants/pascha-nostrum) replaces the *Venite* during the [Octave of Easter](/glossary/liturgical-terms#octave);[^22] and according to the Use of Sarum, the *Venite* is omitted on the last three days of Holy Week and on All Souls' Day.[^23]

## Psalms

After the Invitatory come the psalms appointed for the day.[^24] The proper posture for chanting the psalms is seated, as it is properly a meditation.[^25]

Antiphonal psalmody traces its origins to the Jewish temple, and the early Christians continued on in the regular chanting of psalms.[^26] In the 6th century, the *Rule of Saint Benedict* outlined a seven-day psalter, so that by the end of each week all 150 Psalms would have been chanted—a task, Benedict notes, that his predecessors had accomplished within a single day.[^27] To make the Office more accessible to the laity, the 1549 Prayer Book adopted a monthly psalter, a feature still retained in the 1928 Prayer Book.[^28]

## First Lesson

Then comes the First Lesson from the Old Testament. Ordinarily, the [lector](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lector) stands, approaches the [lectern](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lectern), bows or genuflects toward the altar, and faces the seated congregation to read.[^29] Before reading, the lector says, "Here beginneth the *nth* verse of the *nth* chapter of the Book of *N*." After reading, the lector says, "Here endeth the *Nth* Lesson."[^30]

## Te Deum

At Morning Prayer, the First Lesson is followed by the singing of the [*Te Deum*](/liturgy/music/chants/te-deum).[^31] The *Te Deum*, also called the "Ambrosian Hymn," is an ancient hymn dating from the 4th century, or perhaps even earlier.[^32] In the 6th century, it was prescribed for Matins on Lord's Days in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^33] The proper posture for the *Te Deum*, as well as for all canticles, is standing. According to the Use of Sarum, the *Te Deum* is sung on the following occasions:

- **All Feasts and Lord's Days**
- **Daily during:**
  - Christmastide
  - Octave of Epiphany
  - Eastertide, except on [Rogation Days](/glossary/liturgical-terms#rogation-days)
  - Whitsuntide
- **Omitted during:**
  - Advent
  - Holy Innocents' Day, unless it falls on a Sunday
  - From Septuagesima to Passion Sunday (inclusive)
  - The Last Three Days of Holy Week
  - All Souls' Day[^34][^35]

## Old Testament Canticles

The Prayer Book gives the option of singing an [Old Testament Canticle](/liturgy/psalter#old-testament-canticles), the [*Benedicite*](/liturgy/music/chants/benedicite), in place of the *Te Deum* at Morning Prayer.[^36] This reflects the ancient practice by which the Old Testament Canticles were distributed and sung daily at [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds).[^37] Accordingly, on days when the *Te Deum* is not sung, this Office uses an Old Testament Canticle appointed to the day, in accordance with the ancient precedent.

As an optional devotional practice for those comfortable singing in Latin, one may choose to follow the Benedictine practice of singing the *Benedicite* together with the [*Facta est cum Angelo*](/liturgy/music/chants/facta-est-cum-angelo) on Christmas Day.[^38] Although they are technically [sequences](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sequence), the [*Victimae paschali laudes*](/liturgy/music/chants/victimae-paschali-laudes) and the [*Veni Sancte Spiritus*](/liturgy/music/chants/veni-sancte-spiritus) are also fitting choices for Easter and Pentecost, respectively.

## Second Lesson

The Second Lesson from the New Testament then follows, using the same rubrics as the First Lesson.[^39]

## Gospel Canticles

[***Benedictus***](/liturgy/music/chants/benedictus)

*The Rule of Saint Benedict* prescribes a Gospel Canticle after the lessons at Lauds,[^40] and in 820 AD, Frankish Bishop Amalarius attested to the use of the *Benedictus* as this canticle.[^41] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places it after the Second Lesson at Morning Prayer.[^42] Before singing a Gospel Canticle, it is customary to make the Sign of the Cross.[^43]

[***Magnificat***](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat)

*The Rule of Saint Benedict* prescribes a Gospel Canticle after the lesson at [Vespers](/glossary/liturgical-terms#vespers),[^44] and in 820 AD, Amalarius attested to the use of the *Magnificat* as this canticle.[^45] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places it after the First Lesson at Evening Prayer.[^46]

The [O Antiphons](/glossary/liturgical-terms#o-antiphons) have been added to the *Magnificat* during the last seven nights of Advent since as early as the 6th century, when [Boethius](/people/scholars/boethius) attested to their use in his *Consolation of Philosophy*.[^47] Accordingly, this Office includes the English paraphrase of the O Antiphons before the *Magnificat* at Evening Prayer on these days.

[***Nunc dimittis***](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis)

The Nunc dimittis has been used as an evening prayer since at least the 4th century, when it was included in the *Apostolic Constitutions*.[^48] In 820 AD, Amalarius attested to the use of the *Nunc dimittis* after the lesson at at [Compline](/glossary/liturgical-terms#compline).[^49] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places it after the Second Lesson at Evening Prayer.[^50]

## Concluding Rites
---

## Apostles' Creed

The Concluding Rites of the Office begin with the [Apostles' Creed](/liturgy/creeds/apostles-creed).[^51] The Apostles' Creed is one of the most enduring and widely used Christian confessions of faith, tracing its roots back to as early as the 2nd century. It developed from the Old Roman Creed, reaching its present form by the 8th century.[^52] It is customary to make the sign of the Cross at the end of the Apostles' Creed.[^53]

## Salutation

Following the Apostles' Creed, a priest or deacon recites the [Salutation](/glossary/liturgical-terms#salutation).[^54] According to the Psalter, if the Officiant is not a priest or a deacon, the following may be recited instead:

<Poetry>
|  \V O Lord, hear our prayer.
|  \R And let our cry come unto thee.
|  \V Let us pray.[^55]
</Poetry>

## Suffrages

Immediately following the Salutation, the [Suffrages](/glossary/liturgical-terms#suffrages) are recited kneeling.[^56] If the Officiant is a priest or a deacon, he may continue to stand.[^57] The Suffrages are intercessions meant to serve as an active response to [St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) exhortation in his First Epistle to Timothy: "I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:1–4).

## Collects

After the Suffrages come the Collects,[^58] which according to the Psalter are chanted either using the [festal tone](/liturgy/daily-office/chant-rubrics#chanting-the-collects) or, on ferial days, *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="recto-tono" text="recto tono" />*.[^59]

The first collect is always the proper one appointed for the Sunday or feast day. The last two collects—for grace and for peace at Morning Prayer, and for grace and for aid against perils at Evening Prayer—belong to the Ordinary. Other feasts and observances are sometimes commemorated after the first collect.[^60]

The Collects for this Office have been drawn from the Prayer Book wherever possible.[^61] For days on which the Prayer Book provides no collect—particularly minor feasts and commemorations—collects have been carefully chosen from the following sources:
- American *Book of Common Prayer* (1979)[^62]
- *<Definition lang="english" anchor="breviary-offices" text="Breviary Offices" />* (1874),[^63]
- *<Definition lang="english" anchor="common-worship" text="Common Worship" />* (2000),[^64]
- *<Definition lang="english" anchor="lesser-feasts-and-fasts" text="Lesser Feasts and Fasts" />* (2024).[^65]

## The Grace

Finally, the Grace is recited to conclude the Office.[^66] It is customary to make the Sign of the Cross at the Grace.[^67] The words of the Grace are taken from St. Paul's benediction at the end of his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (2 Cor. 13:14).

<Poetry>
|  The grace # of our Lord Jesus Christ,
|      and the love of God,
|      and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,
|          be with us all evermore. Amen.
</Poetry>

## After the Office
---

According to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, whatever time remains after Morning Prayer is to be devoted to thoughtful study of the Psalms and Lessons.[^68] It is also appropriate to include here the study of the Church Fathers and the lives of the saints.
