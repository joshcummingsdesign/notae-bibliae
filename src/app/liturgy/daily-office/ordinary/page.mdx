<Initial text="Daily Office: Ordinary" />

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="ordinarius" text="Ordinary" /> refers to the parts of the Daily Office that are generally unchanged regardless of the day or liturgical season.

## Before the Office
---

## Candles

Two altar candles of pure wax are lit in preparation for the Office. Their light symbolizes Christ as the Light of the World (John 8:12); their number signifies his two natures, human and divine; and the pure wax reflects his holiness and purity.[^1]

## Silent Prayer

Before the Office, it is customary to make the [Sign of the Cross](/liturgy/prayers/sign-of-the-cross) and kneel in silent prayer. The 15th-century [*Myroure of Our Ladye*](/meditations/silent-prayer-before-the-daily-office), written for the Bridgettine Sisters of Syon Abbey in West London, beautifully describes in detail the purpose of kneeling in silent prayer as a way of preparing one's heart and mind for the Office.[^2]

## Introductory Rites
---

## Opening Sentence

The Introductory Rites of the Office begin with the reading of the Opening Sentence.[^3] The Opening Sentence is the scriptural call to worship which sets the spiritual tone for the Office. Ordinarily, the Officiant proceeds from the [sacristy](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sacristy) into the [chancel](/glossary/liturgical-terms#chancel), at which point all stand. The Officiant then bows or [genuflects](/glossary/liturgical-terms#genuflection) toward the altar and turns to the congregation to read the Opening Sentence proper to the day.[^4] The selection of Opening Sentences for this Office come from the Psalter (*<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Psalter" />*, abbreviated SDP).[^5]

## General Confession

The General Confession then follows.[^6] The General Confession is an act of repentance in which we "with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need" (Heb. 4:16). The 1530 [*Augsburg Confession*](/meditations/luther-on-repentance) beautifully describes in detail the meaning and purpose of repentance.[^7] Reciting the General Confession at Morning and Evening Prayer reflects the ancient practice of twice-daily confession at [Prime](/glossary/liturgical-terms#prime) and [Compline](/glossary/liturgical-terms#compline).[^8]

First, the Exhortation is given, at which point all kneel. If the Officiant is a priest or a deacon, he may continue to stand. Then, all recite the General Confession. After the General Confession, the Absolution is given by the priest. According to the Psalter, if a priest is not present, the [collect](/glossary/liturgical-terms#collect) for the Twenty-First Sunday After Trinity is recited instead.[^9] Space here is given to meditate on the Gospel—that is, to desire comfort and refreshment for the soul, and to find it in Christ Jesus.

## Our Father

Then the Officiant kneels along with the congregation for the [Our Father](/liturgy/prayers/our-father), which serves as a liturgical response to the Absolution.[^10] As the burning coal purified Isaiah's lips, so the Absolution prepares the faithful to respond, "Here I am! Send me" (Isa. 6:6-8). Having been forgiven, we are thus able to pray with confidence, "Our Father."

This order also harmonizes with the [Use of Sarum](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite), which states, "Before the beginning of the [Hours](/glossary/liturgical-terms#liturgy-of-the-hours), the Lord's Prayer is always said...Whence [Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon), 'At the beginning of any work whatsoever, preface it with the Lord's Prayer and the Sign of the Cross on the forehead, according to what is written: Before prayer, prepare thy soul for the Lord; and be not as a man that tempteth God' (Sir. 18:23)."[^11]

The [*Myroure of Our Ladye*](/meditations/the-lords-prayer-an-exposition-of-the-our-father) beautifully describes in more detail the rich meaning of the Our Father.[^12] According to ancient precedent, the Sign of the Cross is made at the end of the Our Father.[^13]

## Office Proper
---

## Opening Versicles

The Office Proper begins with the reciting of the Opening Versicles.[^14] In the 6th century, the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*](/liturgy/rites/benedictine-rite/liturgy-of-the-hours) prescribed two [versicles](/glossary/liturgical-terms#versicle) for the opening of [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins): the [*Domine labia mea*](/liturgy/music/chants/domine-labia-mea) and the [*Deus in adjutorium*](/liturgy/music/chants/deus-in-adjutorium). This was to be followed by the [*Gloria Patri*](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) and the [*Alleluia*](/liturgy/music/chants/alleluia). The *Domine labia mea* was to be omitted the other hours of the day, and the *Alleluia* was to be omitted during certain times of the year.[^15] The Prayer Book simplified these rubrics by using the *Domine labia mea* and the *Gloria Patri* for both Morning and Evening Prayer, and by replacing the *Alleluia* with "Praise ye the Lord. The Lord's name be praised."

According to the Prayer Book, the *Domine labia mea* is recited still kneeling, and all stand for the *Gloria Patri*. According to ancient precedent, the Sign of the Cross is made on the lips with the right thumb when saying, "O Lord, open thou my lips," and unless the proper posture is seated, it is customary to bow toward the altar whenever reciting the *Groria Patri*.[^16] According to the Use of Sarum, the Opening Versicles and the [Invitatory](/glossary/liturgical-terms/#invitatory) are omitted on the last three days of Holy Week and on All Souls' Day, reflecting the solemn character of these observances.[^17]

## Invitatory

At Morning Prayer, the Invitatory (Psalm 95, the [*Venite*](/liturgy/music/chants/venite)) follows the Opening Versicles.[^18] The use of the *Venite* in Christian worship dates back to at least the 4th century, when it was attested to by [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo),[^19] and its use at Matins was prescribed in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^20]

Chant tones and [antiphons](/glossary/liturgical-terms#antiphon) for the *Venite*, appointed for the seasons throughout the year, can be found in the Psalter. The Psalter includes two endings for the *Venite*. The first ending, taken from the Prayer Book, is drawn from Psalm 96. The second ending comes directly from Psalm 95 and is therefore preferred.[^21]

According to the Prayer Book, on days when the *Venite* is sung, Psalm 95 should be omitted from the Psalms of the Day to avoid duplication.[^22] During the [Octave of Easter](/glossary/liturgical-terms#octave), the [*Pascha nostrum*](/liturgy/music/chants/pascha-nostrum) replaces the *Venite*.[^23] Although the Prayer Book allows for the omission of the *Venite* on Ash Wednesday,[^24] this Office retains it, following ancient precedent.[^25]

## Psalms of the Day

After the Invitatory come the Psalms of the Day.[^26] The proper posture for chanting the psalms is seated, as it is properly a meditation.[^27]

Antiphonal psalmody traces its origins to the Jewish temple, and the early Christians continued on in the regular chanting of psalms.[^28] In the 6th century, the *Rule of Saint Benedict* outlined a seven-day psalter, so that by the end of each week all 150 Psalms would have been chanted—a task, Benedict notes, that his predecessors had accomplished within a single day.[^29] To make the Office more accessible to the laity, the 1549 Prayer Book adopted a monthly psalter, a feature still retained in the 1928 Prayer Book.[^30]

This Office concludes every psalm and [canticle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#canticle) with the *Gloria Patri*, even when the Prayer Book permits an alternative.

## First Lesson

Then comes the First Lesson from the Old Testament. Ordinarily, the [lector](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lector) stands, approaches the [lectern](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lectern), bows or genuflects toward the altar, and faces the seated congregation to read.[^31] Before reading, the lector says, "Here beginneth the *nth* verse of the *nth* chapter of the Book of *N*." After reading, the lector says, "Here endeth the *Nth* Lesson."[^32]

## Te Deum

At Morning Prayer, the First Lesson is followed by the singing of the [*Te Deum*](/liturgy/music/chants/te-deum).[^33] The *Te Deum*, also called the "Ambrosian Hymn," is an ancient hymn dating back to the 4th century, or perhaps even earlier.[^34] In the 6th century, it was prescribed for Matins on Lord's Days in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^35] The proper posture for the *Te Deum* and the Canticles is standing.[^36] According to the Use of Sarum, the *Te Deum* is sung on the following occasions:

- **All Feasts and Lord's Days**
- **Daily during:**
  - Christmastide
  - Octave of Epiphany
  - Eastertide, except on [Rogation Days](/glossary/liturgical-terms#rogation-days)
  - Whitsuntide
- **Omitted during:**
  - Advent
  - Holy Innocents' Day, unless it falls on a Sunday
  - From Septuagesima to Passion Sunday (inclusive)
  - The Last Three Days of Holy Week
  - All Souls' Day[^37][^38]

## Old Testament Canticles

On days when the *Te Deum* is not sung, this Office replaces it with an [Old Testament Canticle](/liturgy/psalter#old-testament-canticles). This reflects the ancient practice whereby the Old Testament Canticles were distributed and sung daily at [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds),[^39] which in turn explains why the Prayer Book gives the [*Benedicite*](/liturgy/music/chants/benedicite) as an alternative to the *Te Deum*.[^40]

As an optional devotional practice for those comfortable singing in Latin, one may choose to follow the Benedictine practice of singing the *Benedicite* together with the [*Facta est cum Angelo*](/liturgy/music/chants/facta-est-cum-angelo) on Christmas Day.[^41] Although technically [sequences](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sequence), the [*Victimae paschali laudes*](/liturgy/music/chants/victimae-paschali-laudes) and the [*Veni Sancte Spiritus*](/liturgy/music/chants/veni-sancte-spiritus) are also fitting choices for Easter and Pentecost, respectively.

## Second Lesson

Then comes the Second Lesson from the New Testament, read according to the same rubrics as the First Lesson.[^42]

## Gospel Canticles

[***Benedictus***](/liturgy/music/chants/benedictus)

*The Rule of Saint Benedict* prescribed a Gospel Canticle after the Lessons at Lauds,[^43] and in 820 AD, Amalarius, Frankish bishop and contemporary of Charlemagne, attested to the use of the *Benedictus* as this canticle.[^44] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places the *Benedictus* after the Second Lesson at Morning Prayer.[^45] This placement is fitting because, like [St. John the Baptist](/people/saints/biblical/john-the-baptist)—about whom this canticle is written—it links together the Old and New Testaments.

Although the Prayer Book permits certain omissions or substitutions, this Office preserves all the Gospel Canticles in full at their appointed places. It is customary to make the Sign of the Cross at the beginning of each Gospel Canticle.[^46]

[***Magnificat***](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat)

*The Rule of Saint Benedict* also prescribed a Gospel Canticle after the Lesson at [Vespers](/glossary/liturgical-terms#vespers),[^47] and Amalarius attested to the use of the *Magnificat* as this canticle.[^48] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places the *Magnificat* after the First Lesson at Evening Prayer.[^49] As with the *Benedictus*, this placement is fitting because, like [Our Lady](/people/saints/biblical/blessed-virgin-mary)—who first uttered the words of this canticle—it links together the Old and New Testaments.

According to ancient precedent, the [O Antiphons](/glossary/liturgical-terms#o-antiphons) are sung before and after the *Magnificat* at Vespers the last seven nights of Advent.[^50] Accordingly, this Office uses the verses of the English paraphrase—[*O Come, O Come, Emmanuel*](/liturgy/music/hymns/o-come-o-come-emmanuel)—as antiphons before and after the *Magnificat* at Evening Prayer on these nights. Five of the verses are drawn from *<Definition lang="english" anchor="hymns-ancient-and-modern" text="Hymns Ancient & Modern" />* (1861),[^51] while the other two—[*O Sapientia*](/liturgy/music/chants/o-sapientia) and [*O Rex gentium*](/liturgy/music/chants/o-rex-gentium)—which were added later, are taken from *The Hymnal of the Episcopal Church* (1940).[^52] The verses are sung to the traditional melody, the earliest surviving manuscripts of which date back to the 15th century.[^53]

[***Nunc dimittis***](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis)

The *Nunc dimittis* has been used as an evening prayer since at least the 4th century, when it was included in the *Apostolic Constitutions*.[^54] Amalarius attested to its use in the Office, where it was placed after the Lesson at Compline.[^55] Accordingly, the Prayer Book places the *Nunc dimittis* after the Second Lesson at Evening Prayer.[^56] This placement is fitting because, like Simeon—who in this canticle beheld the face of the child King—we end the day beholding the Lord in his incarnate glory.

## Concluding Rites
---

## Apostles' Creed

The Concluding Rites of the Office begin with the [Apostles' Creed](/liturgy/creeds/apostles-creed).[^57] The Apostles' Creed is one of the most enduring and widely used Christian confessions of faith, tracing its roots back to as early as the 2nd century. It developed from the Old Roman Creed, reaching its present form by the 8th century.[^58] The recitation of the Apostles' Creed at Morning and Evening Prayer reflects its ancient use at Prime and Compline.[^59] It is customary to make the sign of the Cross at the end of the Apostles' Creed.[^60]

## Salutation

Following the Apostles' Creed, a priest or deacon recites the [Salutation](/glossary/liturgical-terms#salutation).[^61] According to the Psalter, if the Officiant is not a priest or a deacon, the following may be recited instead:

<Poetry>
|  \V O Lord, hear our prayer.
|  \R And let our cry come unto thee.
|  \V Let us pray.[^62]
</Poetry>

## Suffrages

Immediately following the Salutation, the [Suffrages](/glossary/liturgical-terms#suffrages) are recited kneeling.[^63] If the Officiant is a priest or a deacon, he may continue to stand.[^64] The Suffrages are intercessions meant to serve as an active response to [St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) exhortation in his First Epistle to Timothy: "I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:1-4). The Suffrages and Collects at the end of the Office trace their roots back to the Use of Sarum.[^65]

## Collects

After the Suffrages come the Collects,[^66] which according to the Psalter are chanted either using the [festal tone](/liturgy/daily-office/chant-rubrics#chanting-the-collects) or, on ferial days, *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="recto-tono" text="recto tono" />*.[^67]

The first collect is always the proper one appointed for the Sunday or feast day. The last two collects—*For Peace* and *For Grace* at Morning Prayer, and *For Peace* and *For Aid Against Perils* at Evening Prayer—belong to the Ordinary. Other feasts and observances are sometimes commemorated after the first collect.[^68]

The collects for this Office have been drawn principally from the Prayer Book.[^69] On days for which the Prayer Book does not provide one—such as lesser feasts and commemorations—a collect has been carefully selected from one of the following sources:

- American *Book of Common Prayer* (1979)[^70]
- *<Definition lang="english" anchor="breviary-offices" text="Breviary Offices" />* (1874),[^71]
- *<Definition lang="english" anchor="common-worship" text="Common Worship" />* (2000),[^72]
- *<Definition lang="english" anchor="lesser-feasts-and-fasts" text="Lesser Feasts and Fasts" />* (2024).[^73]

## Supplementary Prayers

After the Collects, the Prayer Book includes a rubric stating, "In places where it may be convenient, here followeth the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="antiphona" text="Anthem" />."[^74] Many scholars believe this refers to the seasonal Marian Antiphons, which were sung at the end of Compline in the medieval Roman Office. These antiphons can be found in the Psalter.[^75] The Prayer Book also contains additional supplementary prayers which can be recited before the Grace, including *A Prayer for Civil Authorities* and *A Prayer for Clergy and People*.[^76]

## The Grace

Finally, the Grace (2 Cor. 13:14) is recited to conclude the Office.[^77] The Grace serves as both a closing [doxology](/glossary/liturgical-terms#doxology) and a prayer for the gifts of the Three Persons of the Trinity.[^78]

The Office thus begins with repentance, moves through the singing and hearing of God's Word, and ends with a petition for divine favor in the words of the Apostle. The Sign of the Cross is made at the Grace, marking the conclusion of the Office and serving as a visible prayer for God's continuing presence.[^79]

## After the Office
---

According to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, whatever time remains after Morning Prayer is to be devoted to thoughtful study of the Psalms and Lessons.[^80] It is also appropriate to include here the study of hymns, the Church Fathers, and the lives of the saints.
