<Initial text="Daily Office: Ordinary" />

A version of the [Daily Office](/glossary/liturgical-terms#daily-office) based on the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer* (BCP 1928), harmonized with the Roman Rite—especially as shaped by the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia). It is intended for private devotion. The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="ordinarius" text="Ordinary" /> refers to the parts of the Daily Office that are generally unchanged regardless of the day or liturgical season.

## Introductory Rites
---

## Altar Candles

Beeswax candles are the traditional candles used in Christian worship. The pure wax, produced by virgin worker bees, symbolizes the pure flesh of Christ, born of the Virgin Mary. The wick represents his soul, and the flame his divinity. Further parallels may be drawn between the candles and the Light of Christ (John 1:1-5), as well as the lamp that burned from evening to morning before the Lord in the tabernacle (Exodus 27:20-21).

According to the Roman Rite, six altar candles are lit for a solemn Office, and two for a simple Office, arranged symmetrically on either side of the crucifix.[^1] For private devotion, a single candle is appropriate.

## Silent Prayer

Before the Office, it is customary to kneel, make the [Sign of the Cross](/liturgy/prayers/sign-of-the-cross), and enter into silent prayer. The 15th-century [*Myroure of Our Ladye*](/meditations/silent-prayer-before-the-daily-office), written for the Bridgettine Sisters of Syon Abbey in West London, beautifully describes the purpose of kneeling in silent prayer as a way of preparing the heart and mind for the Office.

## Opening Sentence

Ordinarily, the Officiant proceeds from the [sacristy](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sacristy) into the [chancel](/glossary/liturgical-terms#chancel), and all stand. The Officiant then bows or [genuflects](/glossary/liturgical-terms#genuflection) toward the altar and, according to the BCP 1928, reads the Opening Sentence proper to the day.[^2] The Opening Sentence is a scriptural call to worship that sets the spiritual tone for the Office. A selection of Opening Sentences can be found in the *<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Psalter" />* (SDP).[^3] For private devotion, it is appropriate to remain kneeling during the reading of the Opening Sentence.

## General Confession

According to the BCP 1928, the Exhortation, General Confession, and Absolution follow the Opening Sentence.[^4] The General Confession is an act of repentance in which we "with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need" (Heb. 4:16).

The 1530 Augsburg Confession describes repentance as consisting of two parts: contrition and faith. The former is defined as "terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin," and the latter is defined as "[belief] that for Christ's sake [one's] sins are forgiven," and that this belief "comforts the conscience and delivers it from terrors."[^5] Confession, therefore, is not merely remorse for sin, but trust that God, for Christ's sake, forgives us our sins and restores our conscience. Martin Luther's 1529 Exhortation to Confession articulates this profound relationship with remarkable clarity and warmth.

> "So notice then, that Confession, as I have often said, consists of two parts. The first is my own work and action, when I lament my sins and desire comfort and refreshment for my soul. The other part is a work that God does when he declares me free of my sin through his word placed in the mouth of a man. It is this splendid, noble, thing that makes Confession so lovely, so comforting."
>
> <cite>[Luther, Exhortation to Confession, 1529, par. 15](https://bookofconcord.org/other-resources/sources-and-context/exhortation-to-confession/)</cite>

According to the SDP, the Collect for the Twenty-First Sunday After Trinity may be used in place of the Absolution when a priest is not present.[^6] Space here is given to meditate on the Gospel—that is, to desire comfort and refreshment for the soul, and to find it in Christ Jesus.

The BCP 1928 gives the option to recite the Our Father either here or in the Closing Rites. This Office has chosen the latter in order to harmonize with the Roman Rite.[^7]

## Office Proper
---

## Opening Versicles

The Office Proper begins by standing for the Opening [Versicles](/glossary/liturgical-terms#versicle),[^8] which are here chanted according to the Roman Rite.[^9] The chanting of the [Domine labia mea](/liturgy/music/chants/domine-labia-mea), the [Deus in adjutorium](/liturgy/music/chants/deus-in-adjutorium), and the [Gloria Patri](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) at the beginning of the Office dates back to at least the 6th century, when it was prescribed in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^10] During the Opening Versicles, one is to make the Sign of the Cross on the lips with the right thumb when saying, "O Lord, open thou my lips,"[^11] and bow toward the altar at the Gloria Patri.[^12]

According to ancient precedent, the Alleluia is omitted from Septuagesima to Easter Sunday (exclusive), and the Opening Versicles are omitted on the last three days of Holy Week and on All Souls' Day.[^13]

## Invitatory

The [Invitatory Psalm](/glossary/liturgical-terms/#invitatory)—the [Venite](/liturgy/music/chants/venite)—follows the Opening Versicles.[^14] The use of the Venite in Christian worship dates back at least to the 4th century, when it was attested to by St. Augustine.[^15] It was later prescribed as the Invitatory for Matins in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^16]

Chant tones and antiphons for the Venite, appointed for the seasons throughout the year, can be found in the SDP. The SDP includes two endings for the Venite. The first ending is taken from the BCP 1928 and is drawn from Psalm 96. The second ending is translated directly from Psalm 95 and is therefore preferred.[^17]

According to the BCP 1928, the [Pascha nostrum](/liturgy/music/chants/pascha-nostrum) replaces the Venite during the [Octave](/glossary/liturgical-terms#octave) of Easter;[^18] and by ancient precedent, the Venite is omitted on the last three days of Holy Week and on All Souls' Day.[^19]

## Psalms

The psalms appointed for the day then follow.[^20] The proper posture for chanting the psalms is seated, as the chanting of psalms is properly a meditation.[^21]

Antiphonal psalmody traces its origins to the Jewish Temple, and the early Christians continued the regular singing of psalms.[^22] In the 6th century, the *Rule of Saint Benedict* outlined a seven-day psalter, so that by the end of each week all 150 Psalms would have been chanted—a task, Benedict notes, that his predecessors had accomplished within a single day.[^23] To make the Office more accessible to the laity, the BCP 1549 adopted a monthly psalter, a feature still retained in the BCP 1928.[^24]

## First Lesson

According to the BCP 1928, the First Lesson from the Old Testament follows the psalms of the day. Ordinarily, the [lector](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lector) stands, approaches the [lectern](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lectern), bows or genuflects toward the altar, and faces the seated congregation to read. Before beginning, it is customary for the lector to say, "Here beginneth the *nth* verse of the *nth* chapter of the Book of *N*." After the reading, the lector says, "Here endeth the *Nth* Lesson."[^25] For private devotion, however, it is appropriate to read the lesson seated.

When reading, one is encouraged to follow the monastic practice of *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="lectio-divina" text="Lectio Divina" />*: read, meditate, pray, and contemplate. For through contemplation, the Holy Spirit works faith in us to grow in wisdom and charity. And when we grow in wisdom in charity, we become a light to others. [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas) says, "For even as it is better to enlighten than merely to shine, so is it better to give to others the fruits of one's contemplation than merely to contemplate."[^26] This contemplation is nourished by Scripture, which reminds us, "Man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord" (Deut. 8:3).

## Te Deum

The First Lesson is followed by standing for the [Te Deum](/liturgy/music/chants/te-deum) at Morning Prayer.[^27] The Te Deum, also called the "Ambrosian Hymn," is an ancient hymn dating from the 4th century, or perhaps even earlier.[^28] In the 6th century, it was prescribed for Matins on Lord's Days in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^29] According to ancient precedent, the Te Deum is sung on the following occasions:

- **All Feasts and Lord's Days**
- **Daily during:**
  - Christmastide
  - Octave of Epiphany
  - Octave of Easter
  - Whitsuntide
- **Omitted during:**
  - Advent
  - Holy Innocents' Day, unless it falls on a Sunday
  - From Septuagesima to Passion Sunday (inclusive)
  - The Last Three Days of Holy Week
  - All Souls' Day[^30][^31]

### Old Testament Canticles

When the Te Deum is not sung, an [Old Testament Canticle](/liturgy/psalter#old-testament-canticles) may be used in its place. This accords with the Roman practice of singing an Old Testament Canticle at Lauds[^32] and with the option given in the BCP 1928 to sing the [Benedicite](/liturgy/music/chants/benedicite) in place of the Te Deum.[^33]

If one wishes to follow the Roman practice of singing the Benedicite together with the [Facta est cum Angelo](/liturgy/music/chants/facta-est-cum-angelo) on Christmas Day,[^34] the Te Deum may also be replaced on this occasion. Although they are technically sequences, the [Victimae paschali laudes](/liturgy/music/chants/victimae-paschali-laudes) and the [Veni Sancte Spiritus](/liturgy/music/chants/veni-sancte-spiritus) are fitting choices to replace the Te Deum on Easter and Pentecost, respectively.

## Second Lesson

According to the BCP 1928, the Second Lesson from the New Testament follows the Te Deum and observes the same rubrics as the First Lesson.[^35]

## Gospel Canticles

[**Benedictus**](/liturgy/music/chants/benedictus)

*The Rule of Saint Benedict* prescribes a Gospel Canticle after the lessons at Lauds,[^36] and in 820 AD, Frankish Bishop Amalarius attested to the use of the Benedictus as this canticle.[^37] Accordingly, the BCP 1928 places it after the Second Lesson at Morning Prayer.[^38] The proper posture for the Benedictus, and for all Gospel Canticles, is standing.[^39]

[**Magnificat**](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat)

*The Rule of Saint Benedict* prescribes a Gospel Canticle after the lesson at Vespers,[^40] and in 820 AD, Frankish Bishop Amalarius attested to the use of the Magnificat as this canticle.[^41] Accordingly, the BCP 1928 places it after the First Lesson at Evening Prayer.[^42]

[**Nunc dimittis**](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis)

The Nunc dimittis has been used as an evening prayer since at least the 4th century, when it was included in the *Apostolic Constitutions*.[^43] The Roman Rite assigns it after the lesson at Compline.[^44] Accordingly, the BCP 1928 places it after the Second Lesson at Evening Prayer.[^45]

## Concluding Rites
---

## Apostles' Creed

According to the BCP 1928, the Concluding Rites of the Office begin with the [Apostles' Creed](/liturgy/creeds/apostles-creed).[^46] The Apostles' Creed is one of the most enduring and widely used Christian confessions of faith, tracing its roots back to as early as the 2nd century. It developed from the Old Roman Creed, reaching its present form by the 8th century.[^47] It is customary to make the sign of the Cross at the end of the Apostles' Creed. [^48]

## Salutation

Following the Apostles' Creed, a priest or deacon ordinarily recites the [Salutation](/glossary/liturgical-terms#salutation) to begin the closing prayers.[^49] However, according to the SDP, the following may be used when the Officiant is not a priest or deacon:

<Poetry>
|  \V O Lord, hear our prayer.
|  \R And let our cry come unto thee.
|  \V Let us pray.
</Poetry>

All kneel when the "Let us pray" is said.[^50]

## Our Father

Then the [Our Father](/liturgy/prayers/our-father) is recited according to the BCP 1928.[^51] The 15th-century [*Myroure of Our Ladye*](/meditations/the-lords-prayer-an-exposition-of-the-our-father) offers extensive insight into the rich meaning of the Our Father.

## Suffrages

According to the Roman Rite, the Intercessions are recited in the Concluding Rites of the Office and serve as a response to [St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) exhortation in his First Epistle to Timothy (1 Tim. 2:1-4).[^52] The Intercessions correspond to the [Suffrages](/glossary/liturgical-terms#suffrages) in the BCP 1928, which are recited immediately after the Our Father.[^53]

## Collects

According to the BCP 1928, the [Collects](/glossary/liturgical-terms#collect) follow the Suffrages.[^54] By ancient precedent, they are chanted either using the [festal tone](/liturgy/daily-office/chant-rubric#chanting-the-collect) or, on ferial days, *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="recto-tono" text="recto tono" />*.

The first Collect is always the proper one appointed for the Sunday or feast day. The last two Collects—for grace and for peace at Morning Prayer, and for grace and aid against perils at Evening Prayer—belong to the Ordinary. Other feasts and observances are sometimes commemorated after the first Collect.[^55]

All but five of the Collects are drawn from either the BCP 1662[^56] or the *<Definition lang="english" anchor="breviary-offices" text="Breviary Offices" />* (1874).[^57] The Collect for Saints Joachim and Anne comes from the [*Monastic Diurnal*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#monastic-diurnal) (1952);[^58] the Collects for Christ the King and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the commemoration of Thomas Cranmer, come from *<Definition lang="english" anchor="common-worship" text="Common Worship" />* (2000);[^59] and the commemoration of Martin Luther comes from *<Definition lang="english" anchor="lesser-feasts-and-fasts" text="Lesser Feasts and Fasts" />* (2024).[^60]

## Benedicamus

According to the Roman Rite, the [Benedicamus](/liturgy/music/chants/benedicamus) is recited at the end of the Office.[^61] The Benedicamus is a versicle which has been used in the Western liturgy since at least the 11th century.[^62]

## The Grace

Finally, according to the BCP 1928, the Grace is recited to conclude the Office.[^63] It is customary to make the Sign of the Cross at the Grace.[^64] The words of the Grace are taken from St. Paul's benediction at the end of his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (2 Cor. 13:14).

<Poetry>
|  The grace # of our Lord Jesus Christ,
|      and the love of God,
|      and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,
|          be with us all evermore. Amen.
</Poetry>

## Dismissal

According to the Rule of Saint Benedict, whatever time remains after Morning Prayer is to be devoted to thoughtful study of the Psalms and Lessons.[^65] It is also appropriate to include here the study of the Church Fathers and the lives of the saints.
