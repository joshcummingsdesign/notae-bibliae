**Collect for Peace**

<Poetry>
|  O God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works _ do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot _ give; that our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments, and also that by thee, we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and qui_etness; through the merits of Jesus _ Christ our Saviour. *Amen*.
