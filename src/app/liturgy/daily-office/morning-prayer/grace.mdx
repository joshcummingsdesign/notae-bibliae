**Collect for Peace**

<Poetry>
|  O God, who art the author of peace and lover of concord, in knowledge of whom standeth our eternal life, whose service is _ perfect freedom: Defend us thy humble servants in all assaults of our e_nemies; that we, surely trusting in thy defence, may not fear the power of any adversa_ries; through the might of _ Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
</Poetry>

**Collect for Grace**

<Poetry>
|  O Lord, our heavenly Father, Almighty and everlasting God, who hast safely brought us to the beginning _ of this day: Defend us in the same with thy mighty pow_er; and grant that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of dan_ger; but that all our doings may be order-ed by thy governance, to do always that is righteous in thy _ sight; through _ Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
</Poetry>
