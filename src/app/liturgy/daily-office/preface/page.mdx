<Initial text="Daily Office: Preface" />

This version of the [Daily Office](/glossary/liturgical-terms#daily-office) is based on the American *Book of Common Prayer* of 1928 (BCP 1928), received here as a faithful representation of the ancient English Office, rendered accessible to the laity and adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States. Its language, structure, and theology form the foundation of the Office presented here.

To make the Office more fully intelligible and practicable, particularly for those praying it outside a communal or clerical setting, the Prayer Book’s often restrained rubrical guidance has been supplemented where it is silent or abbreviated. These additions are drawn principally from the [Roman Rite](/liturgy/rites/roman-rite), the [Sarum Use](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite), and other early English sources—not to alter the character of the Office, but to illuminate its historical continuity and to guide its performance in accordance with long-standing Western usage.

Particular attention has been given to the practical and ceremonial elements of the Office, including seasonal observances, the use and omission of traditional versicles and canticles, the adaptation of clerical rubrics for lay use, and the fuller provision of [collects](/glossary/liturgical-terms#collect) throughout the liturgical year. This form of the Office is intended for private devotion and makes no claim to official liturgical authorization.
