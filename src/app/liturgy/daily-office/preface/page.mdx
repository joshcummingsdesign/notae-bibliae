<Initial text="Daily Office: Preface" />

This version of the [Daily Office](/glossary/liturgical-terms#daily-office) is based on the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer*, received here as a faithful representation of the ancient English Office, rendered accessible to the laity and adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States. Its language, structure, and theology form the foundation of the Office presented here.

To make the Office more fully intelligible, specific guidance has been provided where the Prayer Book's rubrics are intentionally brief. This guidance—drawn principally from the [Use of Sarum](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite)—is not intended to alter the character of the Office, but to illuminate its historical continuity and to guide its performance in accordance with long-standing Western usage.

Particular attention has been given to the practical and ceremonial elements of the Office, including preparations, proper posture, seasonal observances, and the adaptation of clerical rubrics for lay use. To supplement the provision of [collects](/glossary/liturgical-terms#collect) throughout the liturgical year, select modern sources have been consulted where appropriate.

It is my prayer that this Office build you up in the faith and draw you more deeply into the Church's continual offering of praise and prayer.

*— J. C. Cummings*
