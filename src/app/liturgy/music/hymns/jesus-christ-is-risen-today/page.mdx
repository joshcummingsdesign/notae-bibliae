## History

"Jesus Christ Is Risen Today" (Latin: *Surrexit Christus hodie*) is a 14th-century Bohemian hymn by an unknown author. It originally had eleven verses, and was first translated into English in 1708 by English composer John Baptist Walsh to be included in his *Lyra Davidica* (Latin: "The Harp of David"). Initially the hymn only had three verses translated with just the first verse being a direct translation. The tune was published as "The Resurrection" in the *Lyra Davidica*, and came to be called simply "Easter Hymn".

"Alleluia", the Latinized form of "hallelujah", was added to the end of each line to ensure that the hymn fit the "Easter Hymn" tune. Because the word "alleluia" is traditionally not used in the liturgy during the period of Lent, this song is fitting for Easter Sunday when the word is restored to regular liturgical use.

In 1740, Charles Wesley added a fourth verse to the hymn in his *Hymns & Sacred Poems* hymnal. In 1749, the verses of the hymn were revised and published in*The Compleat Psalmodist* hymnal by English hymnist John Arnold.

Jesus Christ is ris'n today, Alleluia!<br/>
Our triumphant holy day, Alleluia!<br/>
Who did once, upon the cross, Alleluia!<br/>
Suffer to redeem our loss, Alleluia!

Hymns of praise then let us sing, Alleluia!<br/>
Unto Christ, our heav'nly King, Alleluia!<br/>
Who endured the cross and grave, Alleluia!<br/>
Sinners to redeem and save, Alleluia!

But the pains which he endured, Alleluia!<br/>
Our salvation hath procured, Alleluia!<br/>
Now above the sky he's king, Alleluia!<br/>
Where the angels ever sing, Alleluia!

Sing we to our God above, Alleluia!<br/>
Praise eternal as his love, Alleluia!<br/>
Praise him, all ye heav'nly host, Alleluia!<br/>
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Alleluia!
