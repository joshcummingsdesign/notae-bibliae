## Text

<Poetry>
|  Just as I am, without one plea,
|  but that thy blood was shed for me,
|  and that thou bidst me come to thee,
|  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
|
|  Just as I am, and waiting not
|  to rid my soul of one dark blot,
|  to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
|  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
|
|  Just as I am, though tossed about
|  with many a conflict, many a doubt,
|  fightings and fears within, without,
|  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
|
|  Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
|  sight, riches, healing of the mind,
|  yea, all I need in thee to find,
|  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
|
|  Just as I am, thou wilt receive,
|  wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
|  because thy promise I believe,
|  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
|
|  Just as I am, thy love unknown
|  hath broken every barrier down;
|  now, to be thine, yea thine alone,
|  O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
</Poetry>
