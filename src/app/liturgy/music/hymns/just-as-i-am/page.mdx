## Text

Just as I am, without one plea,<br/>
but that thy blood was shed for me,<br/>
and that thou bidst me come to thee,<br/>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, and waiting not<br/>
to rid my soul of one dark blot,<br/>
to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,<br/>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, though tossed about<br/>
with many a conflict, many a doubt,<br/>
fightings and fears within, without,<br/>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;<br/>
sight, riches, healing of the mind,<br/>
yea, all I need in thee to find,<br/>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, thou wilt receive,<br/>
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;<br/>
because thy promise I believe,<br/>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, thy love unknown<br/>
hath broken every barrier down;<br/>
now, to be thine, yea thine alone,<br/>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
