## History

"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" (German: "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott") is one of the best known hymns by [Martin Luther](/meditations/a-brief-history-of-the-reformation-part-3#martin-luther). Luther wrote the words and composed the hymn tune between 1527 and 1529. The words are mostly original, although the first line paraphrases that of Psalm 46. It has been called the "Battle Hymn of the Reformation" for the effect it had in increasing the support for the Reformers' cause.

German theologian and musicologist Johannes Zahn published *"Die Melodien der deutschen evangelischen Kirchenlieder"* (German: "The Tunes of the German Evangelical Hymns")—a critical anthology of almost 9,000 hymn melodies developed and used in German Lutheran churches—in six volumes from 1889 to 1893. Number 7377d from this anthology is the tune used for this hymn, and was most likely written by Luther himself.

The hymn was first translated into English in 1539 by Myles Coverdale, a priest in the Church of England who was consecrated by Thomas Cranmer.

<Poetry>
|  A mighty fortress is our God,
|  a bulwark never failing;
|  our helper he amid the flood
|  of mortal ills prevailing.
|  For still our Ancient Foe
|  doth seek to work us woe;
|  his craft and power are great,
|  and armed with cruel hate,
|  on earth is not his equal.
|
|  Did we in our own strength confide,
|  our striving would be losing,
|  were not the right man on our side,
|  the man of God's own choosing.
|  Dost ask who that may be?
|  Christ Jesus, it is he;
|  Lord Sabaoth, his name,
|  from age to age the same,
|  and he must win the battle.
|
|  And though this world, with devils filled,
|  should threaten to undo us,
|  we will not fear, for God hath willed
|  his truth to triumph through us.
|  The Prince of Darkness grim,
|  we tremble not for him;
|  his rage we can endure,
|  for lo, his doom is sure;
|  one little word shall fell him.
|
|  That word above all earthly powers,
|  no thanks to them, abideth;
|  the Spirit and the gifts are ours,
|  thru him who with us sideth.
|  Let goods and kindred go,
|  this mortal life also;
|  the body they may kill;
|  God's truth abideth still;
|  his kingdom is forever.
</Poetry>
