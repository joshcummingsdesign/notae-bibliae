## History

"Lord Jesus, Think on Me" (Greek: *Mnóeo Christé*, Μνώεο Χριστέ) was written by [Synesius of Cyrene](/liturgy/music/composers/synesius-of-cyrene) in the early 5th century. It was translated into English in around 1875 by English Anglican minister Allen William Chatfield for his *Songs and Hymns of Earliest Greek Christian Poets, Bishops, and others, translated into English Verse*, which was published a year later. John Stainer—organist at St Paul's Cathedral, a famous Anglican cathedral in London—wrote the tune for the 1875 edition of *Hymns Ancient and Modern*, a hymnal in common use within the Church of England. The hymn is also commonly sung to the tune of "Southwell" by William Daman—musician in the royal household of Elizabeth I—which was written in 1579.

## Text

Lord Jesus, think on me,<br/>
And purge away my sin;<br/>
From earthborn passions set me free<br/>
And make me pure within.

Lord Jesus, think on me,<br/>
With many a care oppressed;[^1]<br/>
Let me Thy loving servant be<br/>
And taste Thy promised rest.

Lord Jesus, think on me<br/>
Amid the battle's strife;<br/>
In all my pain and misery<br/>
Be Thou my Health and Life.

Lord Jesus, think on me<br/>
Nor let me go astray;<br/>
Through darkness and perplexity<br/>
Point Thou the heav'nly way.

Lord Jesus, think on me<br/>
When floods the tempest high;<br/>
When on doth rush the enemy,<br/>
O Savior, be Thou nigh!

Lord Jesus, think on me<br/>
That, when the flood is past,<br/>
I may Th'eternal brightness see<br/>
And share Thy joy at last.

Lord Jesus, think on me<br/>
That I may sing above<br/>
To Father, Spirit, and to Thee<br/>
The strains of praise and love.

[^1]: Or "With care and woe oppressed"
