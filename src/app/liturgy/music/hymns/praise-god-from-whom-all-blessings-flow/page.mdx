## History

"Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow" is a doxology written by Anglican priest [Thomas Ken](/liturgy/music/composers/thomas-ken) in 1674. It was used as the final verse of two hymns: "Awake, My Soul, and With the Sun" and "Glory to Thee, My God, This Night", which were intended for morning and evening worship at Winchester College in southern England. It is commonly sung to the tune "Old 100th", written in 1551 by French composer Louis Bourgeois, and found in the second edition of the *Genevan Psalter*. Over time, "Praise God, From Whom All Blessings Flow" gained popularity beyond Winchester College, and simply came to be known as "The Doxology". It is used during the offertory in many protestant traditions.
