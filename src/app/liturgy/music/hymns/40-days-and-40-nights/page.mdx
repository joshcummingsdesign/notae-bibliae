## History

"40 Days and 40 Nights" is a Lenten hymn written in 1856 by English Anglican priest [George Hunt Smyttan](/liturgy/music/authors/george-hunt-smyttan). It is set to the tune of "*Heinlein*", which is named after German Lutheran organist Paul Heinlein, though now the tune is believed to have been written by German Lutheran clergyman Martin Herbst. The tune was originally called *"Aus der Tiefe*" (German: "From the Deep"), and was originally published in the *Nürnbergisches Gesang-Buch* (German: "Nuremberg Hymn Book") in 1676 as a setting for Christoph Schwamlein's text based on Psalm 130:1.

## Text

Forty days and for­ty nights<br/>
Thou wast fast­ing in the wild;<br/>
Forty days and for­ty nights<br/>
Tempted, and yet un­de­filed.

Sunbeams scorch­ing all the day;<br/>
Chilly dew-drops night­ly shed;<br/>
Prowling beasts about Thy way;<br/>
Stones Thy pil­low; earth Thy bed.

Should not we Thy sor­row share[^1]<br/>
And from world­ly joys ab­stain,<br/>
Fasting with un­ceas­ing pray­er,<br/>
Strong with Thee to suf­fer pain?

Then if Sa­tan on us press,<br/>
Jesus, Sav­ior, hear our call![^2]<br/>
Victor in the wild­er­ness,<br/>
Grant we may not faint nor fall!

So shall we have peace di­vine:<br/>
Holier glad­ness ours shall be;<br/>
Round us, too, shall an­gels shine,<br/>
Such as min­is­tered to Thee.

Keep, O keep us, Sav­ior dear,<br/>
Ever con­stant by Thy side;<br/>
That with Thee we may ap­pear<br/>
At the eter­nal East­er­tide.

[^1]: Or "Shall not we Thy sorrow share"
[^2]: Or "Flesh or spirit to assail"
