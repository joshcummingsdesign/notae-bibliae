## History

"40 Days and 40 Nights" is a Lenten hymn written in 1856 by English Anglican priest [George Hunt Smyttan](/liturgy/music/composers/george-hunt-smyttan). It is set to the tune of *"Heinlein"*, which is named after German Lutheran organist Paul Heinlein, though now the tune is believed to have been written by German Lutheran clergyman Martin Herbst. The tune was originally called *"Aus der Tiefe*" (German: "From the Deep"), and was originally published in the *Nürnbergisches Gesang-Buch* (German: "Nuremberg Hymn Book") in 1676 as a setting for Christoph Schwamlein's text based on Psalm 130:1.

<Poetry>
|  Forty days and for­ty nights
|  Thou wast fast­ing in the wild;
|  Forty days and for­ty nights
|  Tempted, and yet un­de­filed.
|
|  Sunbeams scorch­ing all the day;
|  Chilly dew-drops night­ly shed;
|  Prowling beasts about thy way;
|  Stones thy pil­low; earth thy bed.
|
|  Should not we thy sor­row share[^1]
|  And from world­ly joys ab­stain,
|  Fasting with un­ceas­ing pray­er,
|  Strong with Thee to suf­fer pain?
|
|  Then if Sa­tan on us press,
|  Jesus, Sav­ior, hear our call![^2]
|  Victor in the wild­er­ness,
|  Grant we may not faint nor fall!
|
|  So shall we have peace di­vine:
|  Holier glad­ness ours shall be;
|  Round us, too, shall an­gels shine,
|  Such as min­is­tered to Thee.
|
|  Keep, O keep us, Sav­ior dear,
|  Ever con­stant by thy side;
|  That with Thee we may ap­pear
|  At the eter­nal East­er­tide.
