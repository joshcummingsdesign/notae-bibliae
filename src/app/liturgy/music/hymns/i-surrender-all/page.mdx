<Poetry>
|  All to Jesus I surrender;
|  all to him I freely give;
|  I will ever love and trust him,
|  in his presence daily live.
|
|  **Refrain**
|  I surrender all, I surrender all,
|  all to thee, my blessed Savior,
|  I surrender all.
|
|  All to Jesus I surrender;
|  humbly at his feet I bow,
|  worldly pleasures all forsaken;
|  take me, Jesus, take me now.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  All to Jesus I surrender;
|  make me, Savior, wholly thine;
|  let me feel the Holy Spirit,
|  truly know that thou art mine.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  All to Jesus I surrender;
|  Lord, I give myself to thee;
|  fill me with thy love and power;
|  let thy blessing fall on me.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  All to Jesus I surrender;
|  now I feel the sacred flame.
|  O the joy of full salvation!
|  Glory, glory, to his name!
|  *Refrain*
