## History

"Amazing Grace" was written by [John Newton](/liturgy/music/composers/john-newton) in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting in Olney (a town in Buckinghamshire, England where Newton was a clergyman) for the first time on January 1, 1773. It was first published in a collection of hymns written by John Newton and William Cowper, which was published anonymously in 1779 and titled *Olney Hymns*. Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in *Olney Hymns* including "1 Chronicles 17:16-17, Faith's Review and Expectation", which was the title of the poem with the first line "Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)". The title refers to David's reaction to the prophet Nathan telling him that God intends to maintain his family line forever. Newton's sermon that day focused on the necessity to express one's gratitude for God's guidance, that God is involved in the daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await. Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly, and was humbled by it. Newton wrote that we were "blinded by the god of this world" until "mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired…our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace." In 1835, American composer William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named "New Britain".

<Poetry>
|  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound!
|  That saved a wretch like me.
|  I once was lost, but now am found,
|  Was blind, but now I see.
|
|  'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
|  And grace my fears relieved;
|  How precious did that grace appear
|  The hour I first believed.
|
|  Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
|  I have already come;
|  'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
|  And grace will lead me home.
|
|  The Lord has promised good to me,
|  His word my hope secures;
|  He will my shield and portion be
|  As long as life endures.
|
|  Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
|  And mortal life shall cease;
|  I shall possess, within the veil,
|  A life of joy and peace.
|
|  The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
|  The sun forbear to shine;
|  But God, who called me here below,
|  Will be forever mine.
</Poetry>
