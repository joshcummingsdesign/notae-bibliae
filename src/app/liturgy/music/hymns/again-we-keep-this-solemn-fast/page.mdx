## History

"Again We Keep This Solemn Fast" is a Lenten hymn based on the Latin hymn *"Ex more docti mystico"* (Latin: "In the manner of a learned mystic") ascribed to [Pope St. Gregory I](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great) from the 6th century. It was first translated into English by [John Mason Neale](/liturgy/music/composers/john-mason-neale) (English Anglican priest, scholar, and hymnist) in the 19th century. Another translation, which is now more widely used, was made by American Roman Catholic priest Peter J. Scagnelli in the 20th century. The tune commonly used to sing this song is "Erhalt uns, Herr" (German: "Sustain Us, Lord") by Lutheran composer Joseph Klug in 1543.

## Text

Again we keep this solemn fast<br/>
A gift of faith from ages past,<br/>
This Lent which binds us lovingly<br/>
To faith and hope and charity.

The law and prophets from of old<br/>
In figured ways this Lent foretold,<br/>
Which Christ, all ages' Lord and Guide,<br/>
In these last days has sanctified.

More sparing, therefore, let us make<br/>
The words we speak, the food we take,<br/>
Our sleep, our laughter, every sense;<br/>
Learn peace through holy penitence.

Let us avoid each harmful way<br/>
That lures the careless mind astray;<br/>
By watchful prayer our spirits free<br/>
From scheming of the Enemy.

We pray, O blessed Three in One,<br/>
Our God while endless ages run,<br/>
That this, our Lent of forty days,<br/>
May bring us growth and give you praise.

Again we keep this solemn fast<br/>
A gift of faith from ages past,<br/>
This Lent which binds us lovingly<br/>
To faith and hope and charity.
