## History

"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel" (Latin: *Veni, veni, Emmanuel*) is a hymn for Advent. It is a metrical paraphrase of the [O Antiphons](/glossary/liturgical-terms#o-antiphons). The earliest source of the melody was found in the National Library of France in a 15th-century manuscript consisting of processional chants for burials. The Latin metrical form of the hymn first appeared in the seventh edition of *Psalteriolum cantionum catholicarum* (Latin: "Psalter of Catholic Hymns") published in Cologne, Germany in 1710.

Five of the seven verses (verses 1 and 3-6) were first translated into English by [John Mason Neale](/liturgy/music/composers/john-mason-neale) (English Anglican priest, scholar, and hymnist) in 1861. American Presbyterian pastor Henry Sloane Coffin translated the two missing verses (verses 2 and 7) in 1916. All seven verses first officially appeared in 1940 in the *Hymnal of the Episcopal Church*.

The words are based on Isaiah's prophecies and reveal the different titles given to the Messiah.

1. O Emmanuel (O God with us) Isaiah 7:14
2. O Sapientia (O Wisdom) Isaiah 11:2
3. O Radix Jesse (O Root of Jesse) Isaiah 11:10
4. O Oriens (O Dayspring) Isaiah 60:1-3
5. O Clavis David (O Key of David) Isaiah 22:22
6. O Adonai (O Lord) Isaiah 33:22
7. O Rex gentium (O King of the nations) Isaiah 2:4

<Poetry>
|  O come, O come, Emmanuel
|  And ransom captive Israel
|  That mourns in lonely exile here
|  Until the Son of God appear
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel
|
|  O come, thou Wis­dom from on high,
|  Who or­der­est all things migh­ti­ly;
|  To us the path of know­ledge show,
|  And teach us in her ways to go.
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel
|
|  O come, thou Rod of Jesse, free[^1]
|  Thine own from Satan's tyranny;[^2]
|  From depths of hell thy people save,[^3]
|  And give them victory o'er the grave.[^4]
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel.
|
|  O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer
|  Our spirits by thine advent here
|  Disperse the gloomy clouds of night[^5]
|  And death's dark shadows put to flight[^6]
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel
|
|  O come, thou Key of David, come
|  And open wide our heavenly home
|  Make safe the way that leads on high[^7]
|  And close the path to misery[^8]
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel
|
|  O come, O come, thou Lord of Might
|  Who to thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
|  In ancient times didst give the law,
|  In cloud, and majesty, and awe.
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel.
|
|  O come, Desire of na­tions, bind
|  In one the hearts of all man­kind;
|  Bid thou our sad di­vi­sions cease,
|  And be thy­self our King of Peace.
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel.
