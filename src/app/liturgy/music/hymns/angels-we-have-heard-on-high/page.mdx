## History

"Angels We Have Heard on High" is a Christmas carol whose lyrics were inspired by the traditional French carol known as *"Les Anges dans nos campagnes"* ("The Angels in our Countryside"), which originated in the late 18th or early 19th century. Inspired by the song, [James Chadwick](/liturgy/music/composers/james-chadwick), Roman Catholic Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle (northeast England), wrote a paraphrase and included original lyrics in 1862, which became the popular version we know today, which is generally sung to the hymn tune "Gloria", a traditional French carol as arranged by Edward Shippen Barnes (19th century organist). The phrase *"Gloria in excelsis Deo"* is Latin for "Glory to God in the highest" (Luke 2:14).

<Poetry>
|  Angels we have heard on high
|  Sweetly singing through the night[^1]
|  And the mountains in reply
|  Echoing their brave delight[^2]
|  Gloria in excelsis Deo!
|
|  Shepherds, why this jubilee?
|  Why these songs of happy cheer?[^3]
|  What great brightness did you see?[^4]
|  What glad tidings did you hear?[^5]
|  Gloria in excelsis Deo!
|
|  Come to Bethlehem and see
|  Him whose birth the angels sing;
|  Come, adore on bended knee,
|  Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
|  Gloria in excelsis Deo!
|
|  See him in a manger laid
|  Whom the choirs of angels praise;
|  Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
|  While our heart in love we raise.
|  Gloria in excelsis Deo!
