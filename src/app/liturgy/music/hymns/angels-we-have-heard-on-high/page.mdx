## History

"Angels We Have Heard on High" is a Christmas carol whose lyrics were inspired by the traditional French carol known as "*Les Anges dans nos campagnes*" ("The Angels in our Countryside"), which originated in the late 18th or early 19th century. Inspired by the song, [James Chadwick](/liturgy/music/composers/james-chadwick), Roman Catholic Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle (northeast England), wrote a paraphrase and included original lyrics in 1862, which became the popular version we know today, which is generally sung to the hymn tune "Gloria", a traditional French carol as arranged by Edward Shippen Barnes (19th century organist). The phrase "*Gloria in excelsis Deo*" is Latin for "Glory to God in the highest" (Luke 2:14).

## Text

Angels we have heard on high<br/>
Sweetly singing o'er the plains[^1]<br/>
And the mountains in reply<br/>
Echoing their joyous strains[^2]<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo!

Shepherds, why this jubilee?<br/>
Why your joyous strains prolong?[^3]<br/>
What the gladsome tidings be?[^4]<br/>
Which inspire your heavenly songs?[^5]<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo!

Come to Bethlehem and see<br/>
Him whose birth the angels sing;<br/>
Come, adore on bended knee,<br/>
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo!

See him in a manger laid<br/>
Whom the choirs of angels praise;<br/>
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,<br/>
While our heart in love we raise.<br/>
Gloria in excelsis Deo!
