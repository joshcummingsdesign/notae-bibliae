## Text

Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.<br/>
Bear pa­tient­ly the cross of grief or pain.<br/>
Leave to thy God to or­der and pro­vide;<br/>
In ev­ery change, he faith­ful will re­main.<br/>
Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heav'nly friend<br/>
Through thor­ny ways leads to a joy­ful end.

Be still, my soul: thy God doth un­der­take<br/>
To guide the fu­ture, as he has the past.<br/>
Thy hope, thy con­fi­dence let no­thing shake;<br/>
All now mys­te­ri­ous shall be bright at last.<br/>
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know<br/>
His voice who ruled them while he dwelt be­low.

Be still, my soul: when dear­est friends de­part,<br/>
And all is dark­ened in the vale of tears,<br/>
Then shalt thou bet­ter know his love, his heart,<br/>
Who comes to soothe thy sor­row and thy fears.<br/>
Be still, my soul: thy Je­sus can re­pay<br/>
From his own full­ness all he takes away.

Be still, my soul: the hour is hast­en­ing on<br/>
When we shall be for­ev­er with the Lord.<br/>
When dis­ap­point­ment, grief and fear are gone,<br/>
Sorrow for­got, love's pur­est joys re­stored.<br/>
Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past<br/>
All safe and bless­ed we shall meet at last.

Be still, my soul: be­gin the song of praise<br/>
On earth, be­liev­ing, to Thy Lord on high;<br/>
Acknowledge him in all thy words and ways,<br/>
So shall he view thee with a well-pleased eye.<br/>
Be still, my soul: the Sun of life di­vine<br/>
Through pass­ing clouds shall but more bright­ly shine.
