<Poetry>
|  Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.
|  Bear pa­tient­ly the cross of grief or pain.
|  Leave to thy God to or­der and pro­vide;
|  In ev­ery change, he faith­ful will re­main.
|  Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heav'nly friend
|  Through thor­ny ways leads to a joy­ful end.
|
|  Be still, my soul: thy God doth un­der­take
|  To guide the fu­ture, as he has the past.
|  Thy hope, thy con­fi­dence let no­thing shake;
|  All now mys­te­ri­ous shall be bright at last.
|  Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know
|  His voice who ruled them while he dwelt be­low.
|
|  Be still, my soul: when dear­est friends de­part,
|  And all is dark­ened in the vale of tears,
|  Then shalt thou bet­ter know his love, his heart,
|  Who comes to soothe thy sor­row and thy fears.
|  Be still, my soul: thy Je­sus can re­pay
|  From his own full­ness all he takes away.
|
|  Be still, my soul: the hour is hast­en­ing on
|  When we shall be for­ev­er with the Lord.
|  When dis­ap­point­ment, grief and fear are gone,
|  Sorrow for­got, love's pur­est joys re­stored.
|  Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past
|  All safe and bless­ed we shall meet at last.
|
|  Be still, my soul: be­gin the song of praise
|  On earth, be­liev­ing, to thy Lord on high;
|  Acknowledge him in all thy words and ways,
|  So shall he view thee with a well-pleased eye.
|  Be still, my soul: the Sun of life di­vine
|  Through pass­ing clouds shall but more bright­ly shine.
