## History

In Roquemaure in France at the end of 1843, the church organ had recently been renovated. To celebrate the event, the parish priest persuaded poet [Placide Cappeau](/liturgy/music/composers/placide-cappeau), a native of the town, to write a Christmas poem. The song was called *"Cantique de Noël"* (French: "Christmas Song"). Soon afterwards, in that same year, french composer Adolphe Adam composed the music. The song was premiered in Roquemaure in 1847 by the French opera singer Emily Laurey. In 1855 the song was translated from French to English by American transcendentalist music critic John Sullivan Dwight.

## Text

<Poetry>
|  O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
|  It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
|
|  Long lay the world in sin and error pining
|  Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
|
|  A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
|  For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
|
|  Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
|  O night divine, O night when Christ was born
|  O night divine, O night when Christ was born
|
|  Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
|  With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
|
|  So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
|  Here came the wise men from the orient land
|
|  The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
|  In all our trials born to be our friend
|
|  He knows our need, to our weakness no stranger
|  Behold your King, before him lowly bend
|  Behold your King, your King, before him lowly bend
|
|  Truly he taught us to love one another
|  His law is love and his gospel is peace
|
|  Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
|  And in his name all oppression shall cease
|
|  Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
|  Let all within us praise his holy name
|
|  Christ is the Lord, then ever, ever praise we
|  His power and glory evermore proclaim
|  His power and glory evermore proclaim
</Poetry>
