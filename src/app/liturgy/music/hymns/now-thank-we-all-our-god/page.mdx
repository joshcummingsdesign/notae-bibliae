## History

"Now Thank We All Our God" (German: *Nun danket alle Gott*) is a hymn written by the German Lutheran pastor [Martin Rinkart](/liturgy/music/composers/martin-rinkart) in 1636.

German theologian and musicologist Johannes Zahn published *"Die Melodien der deutschen evangelischen Kirchenlieder"* (German: "The Tunes of the German Evangelical Hymns")—a critical anthology of almost 9,000 hymn melodies developed and used in German Lutheran churches—in six volumes from 1889 to 1893. Number 5142 from this anthology is the tune used for this hymn, and was written by German composer Johann Crüger, who first published the hymn in 1647.

The hymn was translated into English in 1858 by English hymnist Catherine Winkworth.

<Poetry>
|  Now thank we all our God,
|  with heart and hands and voices,
|  who wondrous things hath done,
|  in whom this world rejoices;
|  who from our mothers' arms
|  hath blessed us on our way
|  with countless gifts of love,
|  and still is ours today.
|
|  O may this bounteous God
|  through all our life be near us,
|  with ever joyful hearts
|  and blessed peace to cheer us;
|  and keep us in his grace,
|  and guide us when perplexed;
|  and free us from all ills,
|  in this world and the next.
|
|  All praise and thanks to God
|  the Father now be given;
|  the Son, and him who reigns
|  with them in highest heaven;
|  the one eternal God,
|  whom earth and heaven adore;
|  for thus it was, is now,
|  and shall be evermore.
</Poetry>
