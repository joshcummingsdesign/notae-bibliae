## History

"Here I Am, Lord" is a hymn written by American Catholic composer [Dan Schutte](/liturgy/music/composers/dan-schutte) in 1979 and published in 1981. Schutte wrote the song at age 31 when he was studying theology at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley. He was requested to compose, on short notice, a piece for the ordination Mass of a deacon, incorporating in the lyrics God's word, of Jesus as the light, and the bread and wine of the Eucharist. The refrain is based on Isaiah 6:8.

## Text

I, the Lord of sea and sky,<br/>
I have heard my people cry.<br/>
All who dwell in dark and sin<br/>
My hand will save.

I who made the stars of night,<br/>
I will make their darkness bright.<br/>
Who will bear my light to them?<br/>
Whom shall I send?

**Refrain**<br/>
Here I am, Lord.<br/>
Is it I, Lord?<br/>
I have heard you calling in the night.<br/>
I will go Lord,<br/>
If you lead me.<br/>
I will hold your people in my heart.

I, the Lord of snow and rain,<br/>
I have borne my people's pain.<br/>
I have wept for love of them.<br/>
They turn away.

I will break their hearts of stone,<br/>
Give them harts for love alone.<br/>
I will speak my word to them.<br/>
Whom shall I send?<br/>
*Refrain*

I, the Lord of wind and flame,<br/>
I will tend the poor and lame,<br/>
I will set a feast for them.<br/>
My hand will save.

Finest bread I will provide<br/>
Till their hearts be satisfied.<br/>
I will give my life to them.<br/>
Whom shall I send?<br/>
*Refrain*
