## History

With origins as far back as the 16th century, an early version of this carol was found in an anonymous manuscript, dating from the 1650s with the text "Sit you merry gentlemen." The earliest known printed edition with the words "God rest ye merry gentlemen" was found in a broadsheet (a newspaper-sized publication) dating back to around 1760. A precisely-datable reference to the carol is found in the November 1764 edition of the *Monthly Review* (an English periodical). The lyrics most similar to the ones we use today were found in a collection of literary works from 1775 entitled *The Beauties of the Magazines, and Other Periodical Works, Selected for a Series of Years*. The earliest printed edition of the melody was found in an arrangement by Samuel Wesley (son of Charles Wesley) in 1815.

<Poetry>
|  God rest ye merry, gentlemen,
|  Let nothing you dismay,
|  Remember, Christ our Saviour[^1]
|  Was born on Christmas day,[^2]
|  To save us all from Satan's power
|  When we were gone astray.
|  O tidings of comfort and joy,
|  comfort and joy,
|  O tidings of comfort and joy.
|
|  From God our heavenly Father
|  A blessed angel came,
|  And unto certain shepherds
|  Brought tidings of the same,
|  How that in Bethlehem was born
|  The Son of God by name.
|  O tidings of comfort and joy,
|  comfort and joy,
|  O tidings of comfort and joy.
|
|  The shepherds at those tidings
|  Rejoiced much in mind,
|  And left their flocks a-feeding
|  In tempest, storm and wind,
|  And went to Bethlehem straightway,
|  This blessed Babe to find
|  O tidings of comfort and joy,
|  comfort and joy,
|  O tidings of comfort and joy.
|
|  But when to Bethlehem they came,
|  Where our dear Saviour lay,
|  They found him in a manger,
|  Where oxen feed on hay;
|  His mother Mary kneeling,[^3]
|  Unto the Lord did pray
|  O tidings of comfort and joy,
|  comfort and joy,
|  O tidings of comfort and joy.
|
|  Now to the Lord sing praises,
|  All you within this place,
|  And with true love and brotherhood
|  Each other now embrace;
|  This holy tide of Christmas
|  All other doth deface.
|  O tidings of comfort and joy,
|  comfort and joy,
|  O tidings of comfort and joy.
