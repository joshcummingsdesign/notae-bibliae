## History

*"Veni redemptor gentium"* (Latin: "Come, Redeemer of the Nations") is a Latin Advent hymn by [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan) written in the 4th century. The hymn is sung at [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins) in the Liturgy of the Hours during the last week of Advent. In 1862, [John Mason Neale](/liturgy/music/composers/john-mason-neale) (English Anglican priest, scholar, and hymnist) translated the Latin *"Veni redemptor gentium"* into English as "Come, thou Redeemer of the earth". Neale and [Thomas Helmore](/liturgy/music/composers/thomas-helmore) (English Anglican choirmaster) saw it as an Evening hymn for the period from Christmas to the eve of Epiphany. Today the hymn is most often sung to the tune of ["Unto Us Is Born a Son"](/liturgy/music/hymns/unto-us-is-born-a-son).

<Poetry>
|  Come, thou Redeemer of the earth,
|  and manifest thy virgin-birth:
|  let every age adoring fall;
|  such birth befits the God of all.
|
|  Begotten of no human will,
|  But of the Spirit, thou art still
|  The Word of God in flesh arrayed,
|  The promised fruit to men displayed.[^1]
|
|  The virgin womb that burden gained
|  With virgin honor all unstained;
|  The banners there of virtue glow;
|  God in his temple dwells below.
|
|  Forth from his chamber goeth he,
|  That royal home of purity,
|  A giant in two-fold substance one,
|  Rejoicing now his course to run.
|
|  From God the Father he proceeds,
|  To God the Father back he speeds;
|  His course he runs to death and hell,
|  Returning on God's throne to dwell.
|
|  O equal to the Father, thou!
|  Gird on thy fleshly mantle now;
|  The weakness of our mortal state
|  With deathless might invigorate.
|
|  Thy cradle here shall glitter bright
|  And darkness breathe a newer light,
|  Where endless faith shall shine serene,
|  And twilight never intervene.
|
|  All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,[^2]
|  whose advent sets thy people free,
|  whom, with the Father, we adore,
|  and Holy Ghost, forevermore.
</Poetry>

[^1]: Or "The Savior now to men displayed"
