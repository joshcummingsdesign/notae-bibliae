## History

*"Veni redemptor gentium"* (Latin: "Come, Redeemer of the Nations") is a Latin Advent hymn by [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan) written in the 4th century. The hymn is sung at Matins in the Liturgy of the Hours during the last week of Advent. In 1862, [John Mason Neale](/liturgy/music/composers/john-mason-neale) (English Anglican priest, scholar, and hymnist) translated the Latin *"Veni redemptor gentium"* into English as "Come, thou Redeemer of the earth". Neale and [Thomas Helmore](/liturgy/music/composers/thomas-helmore) (English Anglican choirmaster) saw it as an Evening hymn for the period from Christmas to the eve of Epiphany. Today the hymn is most often sung to the tune of ["Unto Us Is Born a Son"](/liturgy/music/hymns/unto-us-is-born-a-son).

## Text

Come, thou Redeemer of the earth,<br/>
and manifest thy virgin-birth:<br/>
let every age adoring fall;<br/>
such birth befits the God of all.

Begotten of no human will,<br/>
But of the Spirit, Thou art still<br/>
The Word of God in flesh arrayed,<br/>
The promised fruit to men displayed.[^1]

The virgin womb that burden gained<br/>
With virgin honor all unstained;<br/>
The banners there of virtue glow;<br/>
God in his temple dwells below.

Forth from his chamber goeth he,<br/>
That royal home of purity,<br/>
A giant in two-fold substance one,<br/>
Rejoicing now his course to run.

From God the Father he proceeds,<br/>
To God the Father back he speeds;<br/>
His course he runs to death and hell,<br/>
Returning on God's throne to dwell.

O equal to the Father, Thou!<br/>
Gird on Thy fleshly mantle now;<br/>
The weakness of our mortal state<br/>
With deathless might invigorate.

Thy cradle here shall glitter bright<br/>
And darkness breathe a newer light,<br/>
Where endless faith shall shine serene,<br/>
And twilight never intervene.

All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,[^2]<br/>
whose advent sets Thy people free,<br/>
whom, with the Father, we adore,<br/>
and Holy Ghost, forevermore.

[^1]: Or "The Savior now to men displayed"
[^2]: Or "All laud, eternal Son, to Thee"
