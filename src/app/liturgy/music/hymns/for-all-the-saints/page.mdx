## History

"For All the Saints" is a hymn for All Saints' Day written by Anglican Bishop of Wakefield [William W. How](/liturgy/music/composers/william-w-how) (northern England). It was set to the tune "Sarum" by English composer Joseph Barnby and published in *Hymns for Saints' Days, and Other Hymns* by Anglican hymn compiler and scholar Earl Nelson in 1864. In 1906, it was published in the *English Hymnal* for the Church of England, and set to a tune by English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, which he called *Sine Nomine* (Latin: "Without Name") in reference to its use on All Saints' Day.

<Poetry>
|  For all the saints, who from their labors rest,
|  who thee by faith before the world confessed,
|  thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.
|  Alleluia, Alleluia!
|
|  Thou wast their rock, their fortress, and their might;
|  thou Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;
|  thou in the darkness drear, their one true light.
|  Alleluia, Alleluia!
|
|  O may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,
|  fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
|  and win with them the victor's crown of gold.
|  Alleluia, Alleluia!
|
|  O blest communion, fellowship divine!
|  We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
|  yet all are one in thee, for all are thine.
|  Alleluia, Alleluia!
|
|  And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
|  steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
|  and hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.
|  Alleluia, Alleluia!
|
|  From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,
|  through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
|  singing to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:
|  Alleluia, Alleluia!
</Poetry>
