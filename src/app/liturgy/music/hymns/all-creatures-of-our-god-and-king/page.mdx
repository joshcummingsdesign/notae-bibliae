## History

"All Creatures of Our God and King" is a hymn based on a poem written by [Francis of Assisi](/people/saints/medieval/francis-of-assisi) in 1225 called "Canticle of the Sun". In 1919, English hymnist and Anglican clergyman William Draper paraphrased the words and set them to the tune of "*Lasst uns erfreuen*" (German: "Let Us Rejoice"), an Easter hymn published by German Jesuit priest Friedrich Spee in 1623.

All creatures of our God and King,<br/>

Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Thou burning sun with golden beam,<br/>
thou silver moon with softer gleam,<br/>
O praise him! O praise him!<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Thou rushing winds that art so strong,<br/>
ye clouds that sail in heav'n along,<br/>
O praise him! Alleluia!<br/>
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,<br/>
ye lights of evening, find a voice,<br/>
O praise him! O praise him!<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Thou flowing water pure and clear,<br/>
make music for thy Lord to hear,<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Thou fire so masterful and bright,<br/>
that givest man both warmth and light,<br/>
O praise him! O praise him!<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Dear mother earth, who day by day<br/>
unfoldest blessings on our way,<br/>
O praise him! Alleluia!<br/>
The flowers and fruits that in thee grow,<br/>
let them his glory also show,<br/>
O praise him! O praise him!<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

All ye who are of tender heart,<br/>
forgiving others, take your part,<br/>

Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,<br/>

O praise him! O praise him!<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

And thou, our sister, gentle death,<br/>
waiting to hush our latest breath,<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>
Thou leadest home the child of God,<br/>
and Christ our Lord the way has trod,<br/>
O praise him! O praise him!<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Let all things their Creator bless,<br/>
and worship him in humbleness,<br/>
O praise him! Alleluia!<br/>
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,<br/>
and praise the Spirit, Three in One,<br/>
O praise him! O praise him!<br/>
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
