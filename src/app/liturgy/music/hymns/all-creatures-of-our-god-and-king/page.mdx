## History

"All Creatures of Our God and King" is a hymn based on a poem written by [St. Francis of Assisi](/people/saints/medieval/francis-of-assisi) in 1225 called "Canticle of the Sun". In 1919, English hymnist and Anglican clergyman William Draper paraphrased the words and set them to the tune of *"Lasst uns erfreuen"* (German: "Let Us Rejoice"), an Easter hymn published by German Jesuit priest Friedrich Spee in 1623.
