## History

"Take up Thy Cross, the Savior Said" is an American Christian hymn written by [Charles W. Everest](/liturgy/music/composers/charles-w-everest). It was originally a poem published in 1833 but was later altered to become a hymn. It was then edited by English Anglican priest and hymnist Sir Henry Baker for inclusion in the Church of England's *Hymns Ancient and Modern* hymnal in 1861. A widely used tune is "Breslau", a 15th-century German folk melody.

## Text

"Take up thy cross," the Sav­ior said,<br/>
"If thou wouldst My dis­ci­ple be;<br/>
Deny thy­self, the world for­sake,<br/>
And hum­bly fol­low af­ter Me."

Take up thy cross, let not its weight<br/>
Fill thy weak spi­rit with alarm;<br/>
His strength shall bear thy spi­rit up,<br/>
And brace thy heart and nerve thine arm.

Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame,<br/>
Nor let thy fool­ish pride re­bel;<br/>
The Lord for thee the cross en­dured,<br/>
To save thy soul from death and hell.

Take up thy cross then in his strength,<br/>
And calmly every danger brave;<br/>
'Twill guide thee to a bet­ter home,<br/>
And lead to vict'ry o'er the grave.

Take up thy cross and fol­low Christ,<br/>
Nor think til death to lay it down;<br/>
For on­ly he who bears the cross<br/>
May hope to wear the glo­ri­ous crown.

To Thee, great Lord, the One in Three,<br/>
All praise for­ev­er­more as­cend;<br/>
O grant us in our home to see<br/>
The heav'nly life that knows no end.
