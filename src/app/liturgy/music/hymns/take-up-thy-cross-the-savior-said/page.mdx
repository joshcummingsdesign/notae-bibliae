## History

"Take up Thy Cross, the Savior Said" is an American Christian hymn written by [Charles W. Everest](/liturgy/music/composers/charles-w-everest). It was originally a poem published in 1833 but was later altered to become a hymn. It was then edited by English Anglican priest and hymnist Sir Henry Baker for inclusion in the Church of England's [*Hymns Ancient & Modern*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#hymns-ancient--modern) in 1861. A widely used tune is "Breslau", a 15th-century German folk melody.

<Poetry>
|  "Take up thy cross," the Sav­ior said,
|  "If thou wouldst My dis­ci­ple be;
|  Deny thy­self, the world for­sake,
|  And hum­bly fol­low af­ter Me."
|
|  Take up thy cross, let not its weight
|  Fill thy weak spi­rit with alarm;
|  His strength shall bear thy spi­rit up,
|  And brace thy heart and nerve thine arm.
|
|  Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame,
|  Nor let thy fool­ish pride re­bel;
|  The Lord for thee the cross en­dured,
|  To save thy soul from death and hell.
|
|  Take up thy cross then in his strength,
|  And calmly every danger brave;
|  'Twill guide thee to a bet­ter home,
|  And lead to vict'ry o'er the grave.
|
|  Take up thy cross and fol­low Christ,
|  Nor think til death to lay it down;
|  For on­ly he who bears the cross
|  May hope to wear the glo­ri­ous crown.
|
|  To Thee, great Lord, the One in Three,
|  All praise for­ev­er­more as­cend;
|  O grant us in our home to see
|  The heav'nly life that knows no end.
</Poetry>
