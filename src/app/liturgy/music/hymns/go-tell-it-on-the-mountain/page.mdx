## History

"Go, Tell It on the Mountain" is a Negro spiritual and Christmas carol which was most likely derived from the oral tradition. Early publications of the song are attributed to John Wesley Work Jr., who along with his brother Frederick Jerome Work led the Fisk Jubilee Singers from 1898-1904. The Fisk Jubilee Singers are an African-American a cappella ensemble, consisting of students at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. The first group was organized in 1871 to tour and raise funds for college. The original group toured along the Underground Railroad path in the United States, as well as performing in England and Europe. They have been credited with keeping the Negro spiritual alive. The earliest printed version of the refrain appeared in American music educator Thomas P. Fenner's new edition of *Religious Songs of the Negro as Sung on the Plantations* in 1909. The version we know today was published by John Wesley Work Jr.'s son—John Wesley Work, III—in his *American Negro Songs and Spirituals: a Comprehensive Collection of 230 Folk Songs, Religious and Secular* in 1940.

<Poetry>
|  **Refrain**
|  Go tell it on the mountain,
|  over the hills, and ev'rywhere;
|  go, tell it on the mountain
|  that Jesus Christ is born.
|
|  While shepherds kept their watching
|  o'er silent flocks by night,
|  behold, throughout the heavens
|  there shone a holy light.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  The shepherds feared and trembled
|  when lo, above the earth
|  rang out the angel chorus
|  that hailed our Savior's birth.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  Down in a lowly manger
|  the humble Christ was born,
|  and God sent us salvation
|  that blessed Christmas morn.
|  *Refrain*
