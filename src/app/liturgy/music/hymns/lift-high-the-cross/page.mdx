## History

"Lift High the Cross" is a hymn written in 1887 by English Anglican priest [George Kitchin](/liturgy/music/composers/george-kitchin). Kitchin wrote the hymn while he was the Dean of Winchester (southern England), for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. It has been suggested that the hymn was inspired by the story of Constantine the Great's conversion to Christianity after seeing a cross with "*In hoc signo vinces*" (Latin: "In this sign, you will conquer") on it. It was first performed in Winchester Cathedral. In 1916, Anglican priest Michael R. Newbolt revised the hymn so that it was in twelve couplets and it was printed in the 1916 Supplement to *Hymns Ancient and Modern* where it was was set to the tune of "Crucifer" by English organist Sydney Nicholson.

**Refrain**<br/>
Lift high the cross, the love of Christ pro­claim,<br/>
Till all the world adore his sac­red name.

Come, brethren, follow where our Captain trod,<br/>
Our King victorious, Christ the Son of God.<br/>
*Refrain*

Led on their way by this triumphant sign,<br/>
The hosts of God in conquering ranks combine.<br/>
*Refrain*

Each newborn soldier of the Crucified<br/>
Bears on the brow the seal of him who died.<br/>
*Refrain*

This is the sign which Satan's legions fear<br/>
And angels veil their faces to rever.<br/>
*Refrain*

Saved by this Cross whereon their Lord was slain,<br/>
The sons of Adam their lost home regain.<br/>
*Refrain*

From north and south, from east and west they raise<br/>
In growing unison their songs of praise.<br/>
*Refrain*

O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,<br/>
As thou hast promised, draw the world to thee.<br/>
*Refrain*

Let every race and every language tell<br/>
Of him who saves our souls from death and hell.<br/>

From farthest regions let their homage bring,<br/>
And on his Cross adore their Savior King.<br/>

Set up thy throne, that earth's despair may cease<br/>
Beneath the shadow of its healing peace.<br/>
*Refrain*

For thy blest Cross which doth for all atone<br/>
Creation's praises rise before thy throne.<br/>
*Refrain*
