## History

*"Puer nobis nascitur"* (Latin: "Unto Us Is Born a Son"), is a medieval Advent hymn dating back to the 14th century, or perhaps even earlier. The title is a reference to Isaiah 9:6. The song was first published in the 1582 Finnish song book *Piae Cantiones* (Latin: "Pious Songs"), a volume of 74 medieval songs with Latin texts collected by Jaakko Suomalainen, a Finnish Lutheran cleric, and published by T. P. Rutha, a Catholic printer. It was translated into English by [Rev. Dr. John Mason Neale](/liturgy/music/composers/john-mason-neale) (English Anglican priest, scholar, and hymnist) and [Thomas Helmore](/liturgy/music/composers/thomas-helmore) (English Anglican choirmaster) in 1853.

## Text

<Poetry>
|  Unto us is born a son,
|  King of choirs supernal:
|  See on earth his life begun,
|  Of lords the Lord eternal.
|
|  Christ, from heav'n descending low,
|  Comes on earth a stranger;
|  Ox and ass their Owner know
|  Now cradled in a manger.[^1]
|
|  This did Herod sore affray,
|  And did him bewilder,[^2]
|  So he gave the word to slay,
|  And slew the little childer.
|
|  Of his love and mercy mild
|  Hear the Christmas story:[^3]
|  O that Mary's gentle Child[^4]
|  Might lead us up to glory!
|
|  O and A and A and O,[^5]
|  *Cantemus in choro*,[^6]
|  Voice and organ, sing we so,[^7]
|  *Benedicamus Domino*.[^8]
