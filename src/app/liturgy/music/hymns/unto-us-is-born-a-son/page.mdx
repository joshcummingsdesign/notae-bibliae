## History

*"Puer nobis nascitur"* (Latin: "Unto Us Is Born a Son"), is a medieval Advent hymn dating back to the 14th century, or perhaps even earlier. The title is a reference to Isaiah 9:6. The song was first published in the 1582 Finnish song book *Piae Cantiones* (Latin: "Pious Songs"), a volume of 74 medieval songs with Latin texts collected by Jaakko Suomalainen, a Finnish Lutheran cleric, and published by T. P. Rutha, a Catholic printer. It was translated into English by [John Mason Neale](/liturgy/music/composers/john-mason-neale) (English Anglican priest, scholar, and hymnist) and [Thomas Helmore](/liturgy/music/composers/thomas-helmore) (English Anglican choirmaster) in 1853.

## Text

Unto us is born a son,<br/>
King of choirs supernal:<br/>
See on earth his life begun,<br/>
Of lords the Lord eternal.

Christ, from heav'n descending low,<br/>
Comes on earth a stranger;<br/>
Ox and ass their Owner know<br/>
Now cradled in a manger.[^1]

This did Herod sore affray,<br/>
And did him bewilder,[^2]<br/>
So he gave the word to slay,<br/>
And slew the little childer.

Of his love and mercy mild<br/>
Hear the Christmas story:[^3]<br/>
O that Mary's gentle Child[^4]<br/>
Might lead us up to glory!

O and A and A and O,[^5]<br/>
*Cantemus in choro*,[^6]<br/>
Voice and organ, sing we so,[^7]<br/>
*Benedicamus Domino*.[^8]
