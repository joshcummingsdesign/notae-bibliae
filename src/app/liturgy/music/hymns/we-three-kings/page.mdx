<Poetry>
|  We Three Kings of Orient are,
|  Bearing gifts we traverse afar,
|  Field and fountain,
|  Moor and mountain,
|  Following yonder Star.
|
|  O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,
|  Star with Royal Beauty bright,
|  Westward leading,
|  Still proceeding,
|  Guide us to thy perfect Light.
|
|  Born a King on Bethlehem plain,
|  Gold I bring to crown him again,
|  King for ever,
|  Ceasing never
|  Over us all to reign.
|
|  O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,
|  Star with Royal Beauty bright,
|  Westward leading,
|  Still proceeding,
|  Guide us to thy perfect Light.
|
|  Frankincense to offer have I,
|  Incense owns a Deity nigh:
|  Prayer and praising
|  All men raising,
|  Worship him God on High.[^1]
|
|  O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,
|  Star with Royal Beauty bright,
|  Westward leading,
|  Still proceeding,
|  Guide us to thy perfect Light.
|
|  Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume
|  Breathes a life of gathering gloom;—
|  Sorrowing, sighing,
|  Bleeding, dying,
|  Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.
|
|  O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,
|  Star with Royal Beauty bright,
|  Westward leading,
|  Still proceeding,
|  Guide us to thy perfect Light.
|
|  Glorious now behold him arise,
|  King, and God, and Sacrifice;
|  Heav'n sings Hallelujah:
|  Hallelujah the earth replies.
|
|  O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,
|  Star with Royal Beauty bright,
|  Westward leading,
|  Still proceeding,
|  Guide us to thy perfect Light.
