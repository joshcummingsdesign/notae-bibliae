## Text

We Three Kings of Orient are,<br/>
Bearing gifts we traverse afar,<br/>
Field and fountain,<br/>
Moor and mountain,<br/>
Following yonder Star.

O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,<br/>
Star with Royal Beauty bright,<br/>
Westward leading,<br/>
Still proceeding,<br/>
Guide us to thy perfect Light.

Born a King on Bethlehem plain,<br/>
Gold I bring to crown him again,<br/>
King for ever,<br/>
Ceasing never<br/>
Over us all to reign.

O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,<br/>
Star with Royal Beauty bright,<br/>
Westward leading,<br/>
Still proceeding,<br/>
Guide us to thy perfect Light.

Frankincense to offer have I,<br/>
Incense owns a Deity nigh:<br/>
Prayer and praising<br/>
All men raising,<br/>
Worship him God on High.[^1]

O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,<br/>
Star with Royal Beauty bright,<br/>
Westward leading,<br/>
Still proceeding,<br/>
Guide us to thy perfect Light.

Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume<br/>
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;—<br/>
Sorrowing, sighing,<br/>
Bleeding, dying,<br/>
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.

O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,<br/>
Star with Royal Beauty bright,<br/>
Westward leading,<br/>
Still proceeding,<br/>
Guide us to thy perfect Light.

Glorious now behold him arise,<br/>
King, and God, and Sacrifice;<br/>
Heav'n sings Hallelujah:<br/>
Hallelujah the earth replies.

O Star of Wonder, Star of Night,<br/>
Star with Royal Beauty bright,<br/>
Westward leading,<br/>
Still proceeding,<br/>
Guide us to thy perfect Light.

[^1]: Or "Worship him God Most High"
