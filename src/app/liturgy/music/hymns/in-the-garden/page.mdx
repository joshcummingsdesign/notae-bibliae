## Text

<Poetry>
|  I come to the garden alone,
|  While the dew is still on the roses;
|  And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,
|  The Son of God discloses.
|
|  **Refrain**
|  And he walks with me, and he talks with me,
|  And he tells me I am his own,
|  And the joy we share as we tarry there,
|  None other has ever known.
|
|  He speaks, and the sound of his voice
|  Is so sweet the birds hush their singing;
|  And the melody that he gave to me
|  Within my heart is ringing.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  I'd stay in the garden with him
|  Tho' the night around me be falling;
|  But he bids me go; thro' the voice of woe,
|  His voice to me is calling.
|  *Refrain*
</Poetry>
