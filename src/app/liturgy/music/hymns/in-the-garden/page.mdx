## Text

I come to the garden alone,<br/>
While the dew is still on the roses;<br/>
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,<br/>
The Son of God discloses.

**Refrain**<br/>
And he walks with me, and he talks with me,<br/>
And he tells me I am his own,<br/>
And the joy we share as we tarry there,<br/>
None other has ever known.

He speaks, and the sound of his voice<br/>
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing;<br/>
And the melody that he gave to me<br/>
Within my heart is ringing.<br/>
*Refrain*

I'd stay in the garden with him<br/>
Tho' the night around me be falling;<br/>
But he bids me go; thro' the voice of woe,<br/>
His voice to me is calling.<br/>
*Refrain*
