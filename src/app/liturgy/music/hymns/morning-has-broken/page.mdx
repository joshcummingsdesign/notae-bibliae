## History

"Morning Has Broken" is a hymn by English Anglican author [Eleanor Farjeon](/liturgy/music/composers/eleanor-farjeon) written in 1931. It is set to the traditional Scottish Gaelic tune, "Bunessan" (Scottish Gaelic: *Bun Easain*, "bottom of the waterfall", is a small village on the Isle of Mull off the west coast of Scotland). Eleanor wrote the hymn when she had been asked to make a poem to fit the lovely Scottish tune for the second edition of the hymnal *Songs of Praise*. There was a need for a hymn to give thanks for each day.

## Text

Morning has broken<br/>
Like the first morning,<br/>
Blackbird has spoken<br/>
Like the first bird.<br/>
Praise for the singing!<br/>
Praise for the morning!<br/>
Praise for them, springing<br/>
Fresh from the Word!

Sweet the rain's new fall<br/>
Sunlit from heaven,<br/>
Like the first dewfall<br/>
On the first grass.<br/>
Praise for the sweetness<br/>
Of the wet garden,<br/>
Sprung in completeness<br/>
Where his feet pass.

Mine is the sunlight!<br/>
Mine is the morning<br/>
Born of the one light<br/>
Eden saw play!<br/>
Praise with elation,<br/>
Praise every morning,<br/>
God's re-creation<br/>
Of the new day!
