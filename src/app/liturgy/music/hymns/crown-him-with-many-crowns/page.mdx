## History

The hymn "Crown Him with Many Crowns" was written in 1851 by [Matthew Bridges](/liturgy/music/composers/matthew-bridges), an Anglican minister who later converted to the Roman Catholic Church. Bridges wrote the original six stanzas of the hymn after being inspired by the exaltation and many crowns of Jesus described in passages like Revelation 19:12. In 1868, it was published in the Appendix to the first edition of in the Church of England's *Hymns Ancient and Modern* hymnal along with the tune *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="diademata" text='"Diademata"' />* composed by Anglican organist George J. Elvey.

Objections began to arise in the Anglican Church in regards to Bridge's words, perhaps because of the complex references to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and in 1874, Anglican priest Godfrey Thring wrote an alternate version while serving at St George's Chapel in Windsor castle, and published it in his *Hymns and Sacred Lyrics*.

The song in its entirety touches on the different aspects of Christ's Lordship: the Lamb upon his throne, the incarnate Son of God, the Lord of love, the Lord of peace, the Lord of years, the Lord of heaven, the Son of God and Son of Man, the Lord of life, and the Lord of lords.

<Poetry>
|  Crown him with ma­ny crowns,
|  The Lamb up­on his throne.
|  Hark! How the heav'n­ly an­them drowns
|  All mu­sic but its own!
|  Awake, my soul, and sing
|  Of him who died for thee;
|  And hail him as thy match­less king
|  Through all eter­ni­ty!
|
|  Crown him the vir­gin's son!
|  The God in­car­nate born,
|  Whose arm those crim­son tro­phies won
|  Which now his brow adorn!
|  Fruit of the mys­tic rose,
|  As of that rose the stem;
|  The root whence mer­cy ev­er flows,
|  The Babe of Beth­le­hem!
|
|  Crown him the Lord of love!
|  Behold his hands and side,
|  Those wounds, yet vi­si­ble above,
|  In beau­ty glo­ri­fied;
|  No an­gel in the sky
|  Can ful­ly bear that sight,
|  But down­ward bends his burn­ing eye
|  At mys­ter­ies so bright!
|
|  Crown him the Lord of peace!
|  Whose pow­er a scep­ter sways
|  From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
|  And all be prayer and praise;[^1]
|  His reign shall know no end,
|  And round his pierc­ed feet
|  Fair flow­ers of pa­ra­dise ex­tend
|  Their frag­rance ev­er sweet.
|
|  Crown him the Lord of years,
|  The Po­ten­tate of time,
|  Creator of the roll­ing spheres,
|  Ineffably sub­lime.
|  All hail, Re­deem­er, hail!
|  For thou hast died for me;
|  Thy praise shall never, never fail[^2]
|  Throughout eter­ni­ty.
|
|  Crown him the Lord of heav'n,
|  Enthroned in worlds above,
|  Crown him the king to whom is giv'n
|  The won­drous name of Love.
|  Crown him with ma­ny crowns,
|  As thrones be­fore him fall;
|  Crown him, ye kings, with ma­ny crowns,
|  For he is king of all.
|
|  Crown him the Son of God,
|  Before the worlds be­gan,
|  And ye who tread where he hath trod,
|  Crown him the Son of Man;
|  Who ev­ery grief hath known
|  That wrings the hu­man breast,
|  And takes and bears them for his own,
|  That all in him may rest.
|
|  Crown him the Lord of life,
|  Who tri­umphed o'er the grave,
|  And rose vic­to­ri­ous in the strife
|  For those he came to save.
|  His glo­ries now we sing,
|  Who died, and rose on high,
|  Who died eter­nal life to bring,
|  And lives that death may die.
|
|  Crown him the Lord of lords,
|  Who ov­er all doth reign,
|  Who once on earth, the in­car­nate Word,
|  For ran­somed sin­ners slain,
|  Now lives in realms of light,
|  Where saints with an­gels sing
|  Their songs be­fore him day and night,
|  Their God, Re­deem­er, king.
