## Text

<Poetry>
|  Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
|  O what a foretaste of glory divine!
|  Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
|  born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.
|
|  **Refrain**
|  This is my story, this is my song,
|  praising my Savior all the day long;
|  this is my story, this is my song,
|  praising my Savior all the day long.
|
|  Perfect submission, perfect delight,
|  visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
|  angels descending bring from above
|  echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  Perfect submission, all is at rest;
|  I in my Savior am happy and blest,
|  watching and waiting, looking above,
|  filled with his goodness, lost in his love.
|  *Refrain*
</Poetry>
