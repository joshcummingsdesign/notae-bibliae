## Text

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!<br/>
O what a foretaste of glory divine!<br/>
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,<br/>
born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.

**Refrain**<br/>
This is my story, this is my song,<br/>
praising my Savior all the day long;<br/>
this is my story, this is my song,<br/>
praising my Savior all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,<br/>
visions of rapture now burst on my sight;<br/>
angels descending bring from above<br/>
echoes of mercy, whispers of love.<br/>
*Refrain*

Perfect submission, all is at rest;<br/>
I in my Savior am happy and blest,<br/>
watching and waiting, looking above,<br/>
filled with his goodness, lost in his love.<br/>
*Refrain*
