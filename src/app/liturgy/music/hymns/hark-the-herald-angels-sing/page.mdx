## History

The original hymn text was written as "Hymn for Christmas Day" by [Charles Wesley](/liturgy/music/composers/charles-wesley), included in the 1739 John Wesley collection *Hymns and Sacred Poems*. Wesley's original hymn began with the opening line "Hark how all the Welkin rings". The word "welkin" means "firmament" (Gen. 1:8). This was changed to the familiar "Hark! the Herald Angels sing" by George Whitefield (Anglican minister, evangelist, and contemporary of Wesley in the Methodist movement) in his 1754 *Collection of Hymns for Social Worship.* In the 1782 publication of the Tate and Brady *New Version of the Psalms of David*, Whitefield's adaptation of Wesley's hymn appears with the repetition of the opening line "Hark! the Herald Angels sing / Glory to the newborn king" at the end of each stanza, which is the version commonly sung today. Wesley had originally envisioned the song being sung to the tune of "Easter Hymn" (see [Jesus Christ Is Risen Today](/liturgy/music/hymns/jesus-christ-is-risen-today)), however, in 1840, Felix Mendelssohn composed a cantata called "*Festgesang*" (German: "Festive Song") to commemorate Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type, and in 1855, British musician William Hayman Cummings adapted the music of "*Festgesang*" to fit the lyrics of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". This is the version that is commonly sung today.

Hark! The herald-angels sing<br/>
"Glory to the newborn king;<br/>
Peace on earth and mercy mild,<br/>
God and sinners reconciled"<br/>
Joyful all ye nations rise,<br/>
Join the triumph of the skies<br/>
With the angelic host proclaim<br/>
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"<br/>
Hark! The herald-angels sing<br/>
"Glory to the new-born king"

Christ, by highest heaven adored<br/>
Christ, the everlasting Lord,<br/>
Late in time behold him come<br/>
Offspring of a Virgin's womb:<br/>
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,<br/>
Hail the incarnate Deity<br/>
Pleased as man with man to dwell<br/>
Jesus, our Emmanuel<br/>
Hark! The herald-angels sing<br/>
"Glory to the newborn King"

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!<br/>
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!<br/>
Light and life to all he brings,<br/>
Risen with healing in his wings;<br/>
Mild he lays his glory by<br/>
Born that man no more may die<br/>
Born to raise the sons of earth<br/>
Born to give them second birth<br/>
Hark! The herald angels sing<br/>
"Glory to the new-born king"
