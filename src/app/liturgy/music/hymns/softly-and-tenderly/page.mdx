## Text

<Poetry>
|  Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
|  calling for you and for me;
|  see, on the portals he's waiting and watching,
|  watching for you and for me.
|
|  **Refrain**
|  Come home, come home;
|  ye who are weary come home;
|  earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
|  calling, O sinner, come home![^1]
|
|  Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
|  pleading for you and for me?
|  Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,
|  mercies for you and for me?
|  *Refrain*
|
|  Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
|  passing from you and from me;
|  shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming,
|  coming for you and for me.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  O for the wonderful love he has promised,
|  promised for you and for me!
|  Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,
|  pardon for you and for me.
|  *Refrain*
</Poetry>

[^1]: Or "Calling for you to come home"
