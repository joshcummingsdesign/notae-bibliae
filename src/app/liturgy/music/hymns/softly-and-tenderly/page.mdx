## Text

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,<br/>
calling for you and for me;<br/>
see, on the portals he's waiting and watching,<br/>
watching for you and for me.

**Refrain**<br/>
Come home, come home;<br/>
ye who are weary come home;<br/>
earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,<br/>
calling, O sinner, come home![^1]

Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,<br/>
pleading for you and for me?<br/>
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,<br/>
mercies for you and for me?<br/>
*Refrain*

Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,<br/>
passing from you and from me;<br/>
shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming,<br/>
coming for you and for me.<br/>
*Refrain*

O for the wonderful love he has promised,<br/>
promised for you and for me!<br/>
Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,<br/>
pardon for you and for me.<br/>
*Refrain*

[^1]: Or "Calling for you to come home"
