## History

"O Come, All Ye Faithful" (Latin: *"Adeste Fideles"*, "All Ye Faithful") is a Christmas carol written by English Catholic hymnist [John Francis Wade](/liturgy/music/composers/john-francis-wade) in 1743 (verses 1-3, 5, and 7). In 1794, Etienne Jean François Borderies, a French Catholic bishop, added two additional verses (verses 4 and 6) to fill out the Christmas story. The English translation of verses 1-3 and 7 is the work of Frederick Oakeley in 1841. Oakley was a translator of Latin hymns during the Oxford movement, and worked closely with John Henry Newman, a leader in the movement. This translation appeared in *Murray's Hymnal*, a hymnal for use in the English Church published in 1852 and edited by Francis H. Murray. Verses 4-6 were trans­lat­ed into Eng­lish by English hymnist Will­iam T. Brooke. This translation appeared in the *Al­tar Hym­nal* in 1884, an Anglo-Catholic hymnal.

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant!<br/>
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;<br/>
Come and behold him<br/>
Born the King of Angels:<br/>
O come, let us adore him, (3x)<br/>
Christ the Lord.

God of God, light of light,<br/>
Lo, he abhors not the Virgin's womb;<br/>
Very God, begotten, not created:<br/>
O come, let us adore him, (3x)<br/>
Christ the Lord.

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation,<br/>
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!<br/>
Glory to God, glory in the highest:<br/>
O come, let us adore him, (3x)<br/>
Christ the Lord.

See how the shep­herds, summoned to his cra­dle,<br/>
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;<br/>
We too will thi­ther, bend our joy­ful foot­steps:<br/>
O come, let us adore him, (3x)<br/>
Christ the Lord.

Lo! star led chief­tains, Magi, Christ ador­ing,<br/>
Offer him in­cense, gold, and myrrh;<br/>
We to the Christ Child, bring our hearts' ob­la­tions.<br/>
O come, let us adore him, (3x)<br/>
Christ the Lord.

Child, for us sin­ners, poor and in the man­ger,<br/>
We would em­brace thee, with love and awe;<br/>
Who would not love thee, loving us so dear­ly?<br/>
O come, let us adore him, (3x)<br/>
Christ the Lord.

Yea, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning;<br/>
Jesus, to thee be glory given!<br/>
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!<br/>
O come, let us adore him, (3x)<br/>
Christ the Lord.
