## History

"O Come, All Ye Faithful" (Latin: *"Adeste Fideles"*, "All Ye Faithful") is a Christmas carol written by English Catholic hymnist [John Francis Wade](/liturgy/music/composers/john-francis-wade) in 1743 (verses 1-3, 5, and 7). In 1794, Etienne Jean François Borderies, a French Catholic bishop, added two additional verses (verses 4 and 6) to fill out the Christmas story. The English translation of verses 1-3 and 7 is the work of Frederick Oakeley in 1841. Oakley was a translator of Latin hymns during the Oxford movement, and worked closely with John Henry Newman, a leader in the movement. This translation appeared in *Murray's Hymnal*, a hymnal for use in the English Church published in 1852 and edited by Francis H. Murray. Verses 4-6 were trans­lat­ed into Eng­lish by English hymnist Will­iam T. Brooke. This translation appeared in the *Al­tar Hym­nal* in 1884, an Anglo-Catholic hymnal.

<Poetry>
|  O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant!
|  O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
|  Come and behold him
|  Born the King of Angels:
|  O come, let us adore him, (3x)
|  Christ the Lord.
|
|  God of God, light of light,
|  Lo, he abhors not the Virgin's womb;
|  Very God, begotten, not created:
|  O come, let us adore him, (3x)
|  Christ the Lord.
|
|  Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation,
|  Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!
|  Glory to God, glory in the highest:
|  O come, let us adore him, (3x)
|  Christ the Lord.
|
|  See how the shep­herds, summoned to his cra­dle,
|  Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;
|  We too will thi­ther, bend our joy­ful foot­steps:
|  O come, let us adore him, (3x)
|  Christ the Lord.
|
|  Lo! star led chief­tains, Magi, Christ ador­ing,
|  Offer him in­cense, gold, and myrrh;
|  We to the Christ Child, bring our hearts' ob­la­tions.
|  O come, let us adore him, (3x)
|  Christ the Lord.
|
|  Child, for us sin­ners, poor and in the man­ger,
|  We would em­brace thee, with love and awe;
|  Who would not love thee, loving us so dear­ly?
|  O come, let us adore him, (3x)
|  Christ the Lord.
|
|  Yea, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning;
|  Jesus, to thee be glory given!
|  Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!
|  O come, let us adore him, (3x)
|  Christ the Lord.
