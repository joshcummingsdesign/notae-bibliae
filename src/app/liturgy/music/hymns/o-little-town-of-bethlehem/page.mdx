## History

Written in 1868 by American Episcopal priest [Phillips Brooks](/liturgy/music/composers/phillips-brooks) after visiting Bethlehem three years prior. He wrote the poem for his church, and his organist Lewis Redner added the music. It was first published in *The Sunday School Service and Hymn Book*. Redner's tune is called "St. Louis", but in the United Kingdom, the song typically sung to the tune of "Forest Green", written in 1906 by English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.

<Poetry>
|  O little town of Bethlehem
|  How still we see thee lie:
|  Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
|  The silent stars go by;
|  Yet in thy dark streets shineth
|  The Everlasting Light;
|  The hopes and fears of all the years
|  Are met in thee tonight.
|
|  For Christ is born of Mary,
|  And gathered all above,
|  While mortals sleep, the angels keep
|  Their watch of wondering love.
|  O morning stars, together
|  Proclaim the holy birth!
|  And praises sing to God the King,
|  And peace to men on earth.
|
|  How silently, how silently
|  The wondrous gift is giv'n;
|  So God imparts to human hearts
|  The blessings of his heaven;
|  No ear may hear his coming,
|  But in this world of sin,
|  Where meek souls will receive him still
|  The dear Christ enters in.
|
|  Where children pure and happy
|  Pray to the blessed Child:
|  Where Misery cries out to Thee,
|  Son of the undefiled;
|  Where Charity stands watching,
|  And Faith holds wide the door,
|  The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
|  And Christmas comes once more.
|
|  O Holy Child of Bethlehem!
|  Descend to us, we pray,
|  Cast out our sin, and enter in,
|  Be born in us today;
|  We hear the Christmas angels
|  The great glad tidings tell;
|  O come to us, abide with us,
|  Our Lord Emmanuel!
</Poetry>
