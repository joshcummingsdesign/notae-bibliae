<Initial text="O Little Town of Bethlehem" />

## History

Written in 1868 by American Episcopal priest [Phillips Brooks](/liturgy/music/composers/phillips-brooks) after visiting Bethlehem three years prior. He wrote the poem for his church, and his organist Lewis Redner added the music. It was first published in *The Sunday School Service and Hymn Book*. Redner's tune is called "St. Louis", but in the United Kingdom, the song typically sung to the tune of "Forest Green", written in 1906 by English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.

## Text

O little town of Bethlehem<br/>
How still we see thee lie:<br/>
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep<br/>
The silent stars go by;<br/>
Yet in thy dark streets shineth<br/>
The Everlasting Light;<br/>
The hopes and fears of all the years<br/>
Are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary,<br/>
And gathered all above,<br/>
While mortals sleep, the angels keep<br/>
Their watch of wondering love.<br/>
O morning stars, together<br/>
Proclaim the holy birth!<br/>
And praises sing to God the King,<br/>
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently<br/>
The wondrous gift is giv'n;<br/>
So God imparts to human hearts<br/>
The blessings of his heaven;<br/>
No ear may hear his coming,<br/>
But in this world of sin,<br/>
Where meek souls will receive him still<br/>
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy<br/>
Pray to the blessed Child:<br/>
Where Misery cries out to Thee,<br/>
Son of the undefiled;<br/>
Where Charity stands watching,<br/>
And Faith holds wide the door,<br/>
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,<br/>
And Christmas comes once more.

O Holy Child of Bethlehem!<br/>
Descend to us, we pray,<br/>
Cast out our sin, and enter in,<br/>
Be born in us today;<br/>
We hear the Christmas angels<br/>
The great glad tidings tell;<br/>
O come to us, abide with us,<br/>
Our Lord Emmanuel!
