## History

In 1739, [Charles Wesley](/liturgy/music/composers/charles-wesley) wrote a variation of ["Jesus Christ Is Risen Today"](/liturgy/music/hymns/jesus-christ-is-risen-today) entitled "Hymn for Easter Day". It later came to be called "Christ the Lord Is Risen Today". It was first performed at The Foundery Meeting House—the first Wesleyan Methodist house of worship. Wesley published the hymn in the *Hymns and Sacred Poems* hymnal of 1740, initially with eleven verses of four lines each.

Though today the hymn is commonly sung to the original "Easter Hymn" tune, in 1754 it was published in English nobleman Thomas Butts' *Harmonia Sacra* (Latin: "Sacred Harmony") along with the tune of [Handel's](/liturgy/music/composers/george-frideric-handel) "See, the Conquering Hero Comes!", which was originally composed for Handel's oratorio *Joshua* (1747) and was later added to Handel's oratorio *Judas Maccabaeus* (1746) in around 1751.

In 1769, the hymn was included in English clergyman Martin Madan's *Psalms and Hymns* hymnal, where he omitted the seventh, eighth and ninth verses. In around 1780, the hymn began to grow in popularity in the Church of England. Eventually verse six was omitted and the second and third verses were combined, thus the version commonly sung today has six verses.

"Alleluia", the Latinized form of "hallelujah", is sung at the end of each line, which results in the word being used 24 times in the hymn. Because the word "alleluia" is traditionally not used in the liturgy during the period of Lent, this song is fitting for Easter Sunday when the word is restored to regular liturgical use.

|  Everlasting life is this, Al­le­lu­ia!
|  Thee to know, thy pow­er to prove, Al­le­lu­ia!
