## History

The hymn "Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven" was written in 1834 by Anglican divine [Henry Francis Lyte](/liturgy/music/composers/henry-francis-lyte). The text of the hymn was first published in Lyte's *The Spirit of the Psalms* (1834), a publication intended for the use of his own congregation in southern England. It appeared in multiple influential publications, such as *Hymns Ancient and Modern* (1861) and *The English Hymnal* (1906). It remains one of the most popular hymns in English-speaking denominations. The text is a paraphrase of Psalm 103. The hymn is most commonly sung to the tune *"Lauda Anima"* (Latin "Praise, my soul"), written as a setting for Lyte's words by John Goss (English organist, composer and teacher) in 1868.

<Poetry>
|  Praise, my soul, the King of heaven,
|  to his feet thy tribute bring;
|  ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
|  who like me his praise should sing?
|  Praise him, praise him,
|  praise the everlasting King.
|
|  Praise him for his grace and favour
|  to our fathers in distress;
|  praise him still the same for ever,
|  slow to chide and swift to bless:
|  Praise him, praise him,
|  glorious in his faithfulness.
|
|  Father-like, he tends and spares us,
|  well our feeble frame he knows;
|  in his hands he gently bears us,
|  rescues us from all our foes:
|  Praise him, praise him,
|  widely as his mercy flows.
|
|  Frail as summer's flower we flourish;
|  blows the wind and it is gone;
|  but, while mortals rise and perish,
|  God endures unchanging on:
|  Praise him, praise him,
|  praise the high eternal One.
|
|  Angels, help us to adore him;
|  ye behold him face to face;
|  sun and moon bow down before him,
|  dwellers all in time and space:
|  Praise him, praise him,
|  praise with us the God of grace.
</Poetry>
