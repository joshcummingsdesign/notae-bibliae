## History

The hymn "Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven" was written in 1834 by Anglican divine [Henry Francis Lyte](/liturgy/music/composers/henry-francis-lyte). The text of the hymn was first published in Lyte's *The Spirit of the Psalms* (1834), a publication intended for the use of his own congregation in southern England. It appeared in multiple influential publications, such as *Hymns Ancient and Modern* (1861) and *The English Hymnal* (1906). It remains one of the most popular hymns in English-speaking denominations. The text is a paraphrase of Psalm 103. The hymn is most commonly sung to the tune *"Lauda Anima"* (Latin "Praise, my soul"), written as a setting for Lyte's words by John Goss (English organist, composer and teacher) in 1868.

## Text

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven,<br/>
to his feet thy tribute bring;<br/>
ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,<br/>
who like me his praise should sing?<br/>
Praise him, praise him,<br/>
praise the everlasting King.

Praise him for his grace and favour<br/>
to our fathers in distress;<br/>
praise him still the same for ever,<br/>
slow to chide and swift to bless:<br/>
Praise him, praise him,<br/>
glorious in his faithfulness.

Father-like, he tends and spares us,<br/>
well our feeble frame he knows;<br/>
in his hands he gently bears us,<br/>
rescues us from all our foes:<br/>
Praise him, praise him,<br/>
widely as his mercy flows.

Frail as summer's flower we flourish;<br/>
blows the wind and it is gone;<br/>
but, while mortals rise and perish,<br/>
God endures unchanging on:<br/>
Praise him, praise him,<br/>
praise the high eternal One.

Angels, help us to adore him;<br/>
ye behold him face to face;<br/>
sun and moon bow down before him,<br/>
dwellers all in time and space:<br/>
Praise him, praise him,<br/>
praise with us the God of grace.
