<Poetry>
|  Hosanna, loud hosanna,
|  the little children sang,
|  through pillared court and temple
|  the lovely anthem rang.
|  To Jesus, who had blessed them
|  close folded to his breast,
|  the children sang their praises,
|  the simplest and the best.
|
|  From Olivet they followed
|  mid an exultant crowd,
|  the victor palm branch waving,
|  and chanting clear and loud.
|  The Lord of earth and heaven
|  rode on in lowly state,
|  nor scorned that little children
|  should on his bidding wait.
|
|  "Hosanna in the highest!"
|  that ancient song we sing,
|  for Christ is our Redeemer,
|  the Lord of heaven our King.
|  O may we ever praise him
|  with heart and life and voice,
|  and in his blissful presence
|  eternally rejoice!
</Poetry>
