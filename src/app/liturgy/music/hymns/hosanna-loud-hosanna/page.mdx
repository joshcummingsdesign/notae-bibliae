## Text

Hosanna, loud hosanna,<br/>
the little children sang,<br/>
through pillared court and temple<br/>
the lovely anthem rang.<br/>
To Jesus, who had blessed them<br/>
close folded to his breast,<br/>
the children sang their praises,<br/>
the simplest and the best.

From Olivet they followed<br/>
mid an exultant crowd,<br/>
the victor palm branch waving,<br/>
and chanting clear and loud.<br/>
The Lord of earth and heaven<br/>
rode on in lowly state,<br/>
nor scorned that little children<br/>
should on his bidding wait.

"Hosanna in the highest!"<br/>
that ancient song we sing,<br/>
for Christ is our Redeemer,<br/>
the Lord of heaven our King.<br/>
O may we ever praise him<br/>
with heart and life and voice,<br/>
and in his blissful presence<br/>
eternally rejoice!
