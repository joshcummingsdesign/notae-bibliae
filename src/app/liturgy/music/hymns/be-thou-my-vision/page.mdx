## History

"Be Thou My Vision" is a traditional Christian hymn of Irish origin. The words are based on an Irish poem that has traditionally been attributed to the 6th-century martyr St. Dallán Forgaill. It was translated into English in 1905 by Irish linguist Mary Elizabeth Byrne. In 1912 it was made into verse by English scholar Eleanor Hull. It is commonly sung to an Irish folk tune known as "Slane", named after a village in eastern Ireland.

Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;<br/>
Naught be all else to me, save that thou art;<br/>
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,<br/>
Waking or sleeping, thy presence my light.

Be thou my Wisdom, and thou my true Word;<br/>
I ever with thee and thou with me, Lord;<br/>
Thou my great Father, and I thy true son,<br/>
Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise;<br/>
Thou mine inheritance, now and always;<br/>
Thou and thou only, first in my heart,<br/>
High King of heaven, my treasure thou art.

High King of heaven, my victory won,<br/>
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!<br/>
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,<br/>
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
