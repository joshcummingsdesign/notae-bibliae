## History

Starting in 1523, [Martin Luther](/meditations/a-brief-history-of-the-reformation-part-3#martin-luther) began translating worship texts into German from the Latin. He adapted Gregorian chant melodies used in Catholic worship to fit new German texts. He also wrote many hymns and melodies himself. One such example was "From Heaven Above to Earth I Come" (German: *"Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her"*), a hymn text relating to the Nativity of Jesus, written by Luther in 1534. It may have been written for a family Christmas pageant. The text was first published in 1535 in *Spiritual Songs Newly Improved* (German: *"Geistliche Lieder auffs new gebessert"*)—also known as *Klug's Hymnal* (German: *Klugsches Gesangbuch*)—by Lutheran composer Josph Klug under the header "A children's song on the Nativity of Christ" (German: *"Ein kinderlied auff die Weinacht Christi"*).

German theologian and musicologist Johannes Zahn published *"Die Melodien der deutschen evangelischen Kirchenlieder"* (German: "The Tunes of the German Evangelical Hymns")—a critical anthology of almost 9,000 hymn melodies developed and used in German Lutheran churches—in six volumes from 1889 to 1893. Number 346 from this anthology is the tune used for this hymn, and was written in 1539, most likely by Luther himself.

The hymn was translated into English in 1855 by English hymnist Catherine Winkworth.

## Text

From heaven above to earth I come<br/>
To bear good news to every home;[^1]<br/>
Glad tidings of great joy I bring,<br/>
Whereof I now will say and sing:[^2]

To you this night is born a child<br/>
Of Mary, chosen virgin mild;<br/>
This little child, of lowly birth,<br/>
Shall be the joy of all the earth.

This is the Christ, our God and Lord,<br/>
Who in all need shall aid afford;[^3]<br/>
He will himself your Savior be<br/>
From all your sins to set you free.

He will on you the gifts bestow<br/>
Prepared by God for all below,<br/>
That in his kingdom, bright and fair,<br/>
You may with us his glory share.

These are the tokens ye shall mark:<br/>
The swaddling-clothes and manger dark;<br/>
There ye shall find the Infant laid<br/>
By whom the heavens and earth were made.

Now let us all with gladsome cheer<br/>
Go with the shepherds and draw near<br/>
To see the precious gift of God,<br/>
Who hath his own dear Son bestowed.

Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!<br/>
What is it in yon manger lies?<br/>
Who is this child, so young and fair?<br/>
The blessed Christ-child lieth there.

Welcome to earth, thou noble Guest,<br/>
Through whom the sinful world is blest!<br/>
Thou com'st to share my misery;<br/>
What thanks shall I return to Thee?

Ah, Lord, who hast created all,<br/>
How weak art thou, how poor and small,<br/>
That thou dost choose thine infant bed<br/>
Where humble cattle lately fed!

Were earth a thousand times as fair,<br/>
Beset with gold and jewels rare,<br/>
It yet were far too poor to be<br/>
A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.

For velvets soft and silken stuff<br/>
Thou hast but hay and straw so rough,<br/>
Whereon thou, King, so rich and great,<br/>
As 'twere thy heaven, art throned in state.

And thus, dear Lord, it pleaseth Thee<br/>
To make this truth quite plain to me,<br/>
That all the world's wealth, honor, might,<br/>
Are naught and worthless in thy sight.

Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,<br/>
Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,<br/>
Within my heart, that it may be<br/>
A quiet chamber kept for Thee.

My heart for very joy doth leap,<br/>
My lips no more can silence keep;<br/>
I, too, must sing with joyful tongue<br/>
That sweetest ancient cradle-song:

Glory to God in highest heaven,<br/>
Who unto us his Son hath given!<br/>
While angels sing with pious mirth<br/>
A glad new year to all the earth.

[^1]: Or "To bring good news to everyone"
[^2]: Or "To all the world and gladly sing"
[^3]: Or "Within all need shall aid afford"
