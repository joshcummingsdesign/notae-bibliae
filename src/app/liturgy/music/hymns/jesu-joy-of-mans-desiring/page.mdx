## History

"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" is the popular English title of [Johann Sebastian Bach's](/liturgy/music/composers/johann-sebastian-bach) cantata (a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment) *Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben* (German: "Heart and Mouth and Deed and Life"). The melody was originally written by German composer Johann Schop in 1642 and was published with Johann Rist's hymn text "*Wach auf, mein Geist, erhebe dich*" (German: "Wake, My Spirit, Rise"). In 1661, German hymnist Martin Janus wrote a new text for the tune titled *Jesu, meiner Seelen Wonne* (German: "Jesus, My Soul's Bliss"). In 1723, Bach took stanzas 6 and 17 of this hymn, harmonized and orchestrated them, and placed them as the closings to part 1 and part 2, respectively, of his cantata. Bach had originally intended the cantata for the fourth Sunday of Advent, but because Leipzig observed *tempus clausum* (Latin: "closed time", as in a time of penitence during Advent and Lent), it only allowed cantata music on the first Sunday of the season. Thus, Bach adapted the cantata for the Feast of the Visitation.

## Text

Jesu, joy of man's desiring,<br/>
Holy wisdom, love most bright;<br/>
Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring<br/>
Soar to uncreated light.

Word of God, our flesh that fashioned,<br/>
With the fire of life impassioned,<br/>
Striving still to truth unknown,<br/>
Soaring, dying round Thy throne.

Through the way where hope is guiding,<br/>
Hark, what peaceful music rings;<br/>
Where the flock, in Thee confiding,<br/>
Drink of joy from deathless springs.

Theirs is beauty's fairest pleasure;<br/>
Theirs is wisdom's holiest treasure.<br/>
Thou dost ever lead Thine own<br/>
In the love of joys unknown.
