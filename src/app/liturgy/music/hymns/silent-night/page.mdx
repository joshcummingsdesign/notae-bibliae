## History

In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, a young Austrian Catholic Priest named [Joseph Mohr](/liturgy/music/composers/joseph-mohr) wrote the poem *"Stille Nacht"* (German: "Silent Night") in 1816 in Mariapfarr, the hometown of his father in the Salzburg region. On Christmas Eve 1818, Mohr brought the words to Franz Xaver Gruber, schoolmaster and organist in the nearby village of Arnsdorf, and asked him to compose a melody and guitar accompaniment for that night's Mass at St. Nicholas perish in Oberndorf, located along the Salzach river, as river flooding had damaged the church organ. The song was first performed that night at St Nicholas parish church. The church was eventually destroyed by repeated flooding and replaced with what is known today as the *Stille-Nacht-Kapelle* (German: Silent-Night-Chapel). In 1859, the Episcopal priest John Freeman Young, then serving at Trinity Church in New York City, wrote and published the English translation that is most frequently sung today, translated from three of Mohr's original six verses.

<Poetry>
|  Silent night! Holy night!
|  All is calm, all is bright
|  Round yon virgin mother and child!
|  Holy infant, so tender and mild,
|  Sleep in heavenly peace!
|  Sleep in heavenly peace!
|
|  Silent night! Holy night!
|  Shepherds quake at the sight![^1]
|  Glories stream from heaven afar,
|  Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
|  Christ the Saviour is born!
|  Christ the Saviour is born![^2]
|
|  Silent night! Holy night!
|  Son of God, love's pure light
|  Radiant beams from thy holy face
|  With the dawn of redeeming grace,
|  Jesus, Lord, at thy birth!
|  Jesus, Lord, at thy birth!
|
|  Silent Night! Holy Night!
|  Brought the world gracious light
|  Down from heaven's golden height
|  Comes to us the glorious sight:
|  Jesus, as one of mankind
|  Jesus, as one of mankind.
|
|  Silent Night! Holy Night!
|  By his love, by his might
|  God our Father us has graced
|  As a brother gently embraced
|  Jesus, all nations on earth
|  Jesus, all nations on earth.
|
|  Silent Night! Holy Night!
|  Long ago, minding our plight
|  God the world from misery freed
|  In the dark age of our fathers decreed:
|  All the world is redeemed
|  All the world is redeemed.[^3]
