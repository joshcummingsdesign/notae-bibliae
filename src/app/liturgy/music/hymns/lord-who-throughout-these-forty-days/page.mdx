## History

"Lord, Who Throughout These Forty Days" is a Lenten hymn written by English hymnist [Claudia Frances Hernaman](/liturgy/music/composers/claudia-frances-hernaman) in 1873. The most commonly used tune for Hernaman's text is "St. Flavian". The original form of the tune was first published in *The Whole Booke of Psalmes* (1562), and was set to a paraphrase of Psalm 132 (a psalm of ascents, a royal psalm, about God's covenant with the house of David). The composer of the tune is unknown.

## Text

Lord, who throughout these forty days,<br/>
For us did fast and pray,<br/>
Teach us with you to mourn our sins,<br/>
And close by you to stay.

As you with Satan did contend,<br/>
And did the vict'ry win,<br/>
O give us strength in you to fight,<br/>
In you to conquer sin.

As you did hunger bear and thirst,<br/>
So teach us, gracious Lord,<br/>
To die to self, and always live<br/>
By your most holy word.

And through these days of penitence,<br/>
And through your Passion-tide,<br/>
Forevermore, in life and death,<br/>
O Lord, with us abide.

Abide with us that when this life<br/>
Of suffering is past,<br/>
An Easter of unending joy<br/>
We may attain at last!
