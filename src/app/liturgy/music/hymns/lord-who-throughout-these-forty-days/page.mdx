## History

"Lord, Who Throughout These Forty Days" is a Lenten hymn written by English hymnist [Claudia Frances Hernaman](/liturgy/music/composers/claudia-frances-hernaman) in 1873. The most commonly used tune for Hernaman's text is "St. Flavian". The original form of the tune was first published in *The Whole Booke of Psalmes* (1562), and was set to a paraphrase of Psalm 132 (a psalm of ascents, a royal psalm, about God's covenant with the house of David). The composer of the tune is unknown.

## Text

<Poetry>
|  Lord, who throughout these forty days,
|  For us did fast and pray,
|  Teach us with you to mourn our sins,
|  And close by you to stay.
|
|  As you with Satan did contend,
|  And did the vict'ry win,
|  O give us strength in you to fight,
|  In you to conquer sin.
|
|  As you did hunger bear and thirst,
|  So teach us, gracious Lord,
|  To die to self, and always live
|  By your most holy word.
|
|  And through these days of penitence,
|  And through your Passion-tide,
|  Forevermore, in life and death,
|  O Lord, with us abide.
|
|  Abide with us that when this life
|  Of suffering is past,
|  An Easter of unending joy
|  We may attain at last!
</Poetry>
