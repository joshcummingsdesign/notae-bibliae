## Text

Love came down at Christmas,<br/>
Love all lovely, Love Divine,<br/>
Love was born at Christmas,<br/>
Star and Angels gave the sign.

Worship we the Godhead,<br/>
Love Incarnate, Love Divine,<br/>
Worship we our Jesus,<br/>
But wherewith for sacred sign?

Love shall be our token,<br/>
Love be yours and love be mine,<br/>
Love to God and all men,<br/>
Love for plea and gift and sign.
