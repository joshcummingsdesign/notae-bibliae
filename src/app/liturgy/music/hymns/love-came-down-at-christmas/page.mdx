## Text

<Poetry>
|  Love came down at Christmas,
|  Love all lovely, Love Divine,
|  Love was born at Christmas,
|  Star and Angels gave the sign.
|
|  Worship we the Godhead,
|  Love Incarnate, Love Divine,
|  Worship we our Jesus,
|  But wherewith for sacred sign?
|
|  Love shall be our token,
|  Love be yours and love be mine,
|  Love to God and all men,
|  Love for plea and gift and sign.
</Poetry>
