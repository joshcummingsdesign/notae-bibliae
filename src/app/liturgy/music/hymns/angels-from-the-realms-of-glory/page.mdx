## History

"Angels from the Realms of Glory" is a Christmas carol written by Scottish poet and hymnwriter [James Montgomery](/liturgy/music/composers/james-montgomery) as a loose translation of the the traditional French carol known as "*Les Anges dans nos campagnes*" ("The Angels in our Countryside"), which originated in the late 18th or early 19th century. It was first printed in the English newspaper the *Sheffield Iris* on Christmas Eve 1816, though it only began to be sung in churches after its 1825 reprinting in the Montgomery collection *The Christian Psalmist*. It is most commonly sung to the 1866 tune "Regent Square" by English organist Henry Smart.

## Text

Angels, from the realms of glory,<br/>
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;<br/>
Ye who sang creation's story,<br/>
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:

**Refrain**<br/>
Come and worship,<br/>
Come and worship<br/>
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

Shepherds, in the fields abiding,<br/>
Watching o'er your flocks by night,<br/>
God on earth is now residing,[^1]<br/>
Yonder shines the infant light:<br/>
*Refrain*

Sages, leave your contemplations,<br/>
Brighter visions beam afar;<br/>
Seek the great Desire of nations,<br/>
Ye have seen his natal star:<br/>
*Refrain*

Saints before the altar bending,<br/>
Watching long in hope and fear,<br/>
Suddenly the Lord, descending,<br/>
In his temple shall appear. *Refrain*

Sinners, wrung with true repentance,<br/>
Doomed for guilt to endless pains,<br/>
Justice now revokes the sentence,<br/>
Mercy calls you—break your chains:<br/>
*Refrain*

Though an infant now we view him,<br/>
He shall fill his Father's throne,<br/>
Gather all the nations to him;<br/>
Every knee shall then bow down:<br/>
*Refrain*

All creation, join in praising<br/>
God the Father, Spirit, Son,<br/>
Evermore your voices raising,<br/>
To th'eternal Three in One:<br/>
*Refrain*

[^1]: Or "God with man is now residing"
