## History

"Angels from the Realms of Glory" is a Christmas carol written by Scottish poet and hymnwriter [James Montgomery](/liturgy/music/composers/james-montgomery) as a loose translation of the the traditional French carol known as *"Les Anges dans nos campagnes"* ("The Angels in our Countryside"), which originated in the late 18th or early 19th century. It was first printed in the English newspaper the *Sheffield Iris* on Christmas Eve 1816, though it only began to be sung in churches after its 1825 reprinting in the Montgomery collection *The Christian Psalmist*. It is most commonly sung to the 1866 tune "Regent Square" by English organist Henry Smart.

<Poetry>
|  Angels, from the realms of glory,
|  Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
|  Ye who sang creation's story,
|  Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
|
|  **Refrain**
|  Come and worship,
|  Come and worship
|  Worship Christ, the newborn King.
|
|  Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
|  Watching o'er your flocks by night,
|  God on earth is now residing,[^1]
|  Yonder shines the infant light:
|  *Refrain*
|
|  Sages, leave your contemplations,
|  Brighter visions beam afar;
|  Seek the great Desire of nations,
|  Ye have seen his natal star:
|  *Refrain*
|
|  Saints before the altar bending,
|  Watching long in hope and fear,
|  Suddenly the Lord, descending,
|  In his temple shall appear. *Refrain*
|
|  Sinners, wrung with true repentance,
|  Doomed for guilt to endless pains,
|  Justice now revokes the sentence,
|  Mercy calls you—break your chains:
|  *Refrain*
|
|  Though an infant now we view him,
|  He shall fill his Father's throne,
|  Gather all the nations to him;
|  Every knee shall then bow down:
|  *Refrain*
|
|  All creation, join in praising
|  God the Father, Spirit, Son,
|  Evermore your voices raising,
|  To th'eternal Three in One:
|  *Refrain*
</Poetry>

[^1]: Or "God with man is now residing"
