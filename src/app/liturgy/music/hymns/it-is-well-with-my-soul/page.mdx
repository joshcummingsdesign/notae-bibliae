## History

"It Is Well with My Soul" is a hymn written by American Presbyterian church elder [Horatio Spafford](/liturgy/music/composers/horatio-spafford) and composed by American composer Philip Bliss. The hymn was written following two tragic events in Spafford's life: the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which ruined him financially, and the loss of his four daughters in a shipwreck in 1873. Shortly after the shipwreck, Spafford traveled to meet his grieving wife Anne who survived, and he was inspired to write "It Is Well with My Soul" as his ship passed near where his daughters had died. Bliss called his tune "Ville du Havre", from the name of the stricken vessel.

<Poetry>
|  When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
|  when sorrows like sea billows roll;
|  whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
|  It is well, it is well with my soul.
|
|  **Refrain**
|  It is well with my soul,
|  it is well, it is well with my soul.
|
|  Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
|  let this blest assurance control,
|  that Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
|  and hath shed his own blood for my soul.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
|  My sin, not in part but the whole,
|  is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
|  praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
|  *Refrain*
|
|  And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
|  the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
|  the trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
|  even so, it is well with my soul.
|  *Refrain*
</Poetry>
