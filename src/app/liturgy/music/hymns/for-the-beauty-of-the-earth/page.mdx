## History

"For the Beauty of the Earth" is a hymn by high-church Anglican schoolmaster [Folliott Sandford Pierpoint](/liturgy/music/composers/folliott-sandford-pierpoint). It was originally written as a Eucharistic hymn, and published in *Lyra Eucharistica, Hymns and Verses on The Holy Communion, Ancient and Modern, with other Poems* (Latin: "The Harp of the Eucharist") in 1864. The lyrics were modified to serve as a general hymn, and published in *Hymns Ancient and Modern* (1916). The song is set to a tune known as "Dix", written by English composer Conrad Kocher and named after English hymnist William Chatterton Dix.

<Poetry>
|  For the beauty of the earth,
|  for the glory of the skies,
|  for the love which from our birth
|  over and around us lies;
|  Lord of all, to thee we raise
|  this our hymn of grateful praise.
|
|  For the beauty of each hour[^1]
|  of the day and of the night,
|  hill and vale, and tree and flower,
|  sun and moon, and stars of light;
|  Lord of all, to thee we raise
|  this our hymn of grateful praise.
|
|  For the joy of ear and eye,
|  for the heart and mind's delight,
|  for the mystic harmony,
|  linking sense to sound and sight;
|  Lord of all, to thee we raise
|  this our hymn of grateful praise.
|
|  For the joy of human love,
|  brother, sister, parent, child,
|  friends on earth and friends above,
|  for all gentle thoughts and mild;
|  Lord of all, to thee we raise
|  this our hymn of grateful praise.
|
|  For thy Church, that evermore
|  lifteth holy hands above,
|  offering up on every shore
|  her pure sacrifice of love;
|  Lord of all, to thee we raise
|  this our hymn of grateful praise.
|
|  For thyself, best Gift Divine,
|  to the world so freely given,[^2]
|  for that great, great love of thine,
|  peace on earth, and joy in heaven:
|  Lord of all, to thee we raise
|  this our hymn of grateful praise.
