## History

"For the Beauty of the Earth" is a hymn by high-church Anglican schoolmaster [Folliott Sandford Pierpoint](/liturgy/music/composers/folliott-sandford-pierpoint/). It was originally written as a Eucharistic hymn, and published in *Lyra Eucharistica, Hymns and Verses on The Holy Communion, Ancient and Modern, with other Poems* (Latin: "The Harp of the Eucharist") in 1864. The lyrics were modified to serve as a general hymn, and published in *Hymns Ancient and Modern* (1916). The song is set to a tune known as "Dix", written by English composer Conrad Kocher and named after English hymnist William Chatterton Dix.

## Text

For the beauty of the earth,<br/>
for the glory of the skies,<br/>
for the love which from our birth<br/>
over and around us lies;<br/>
Lord of all, to thee we raise<br/>
this our hymn of grateful praise.

For the beauty of each hour[^1]<br/>
of the day and of the night,<br/>
hill and vale, and tree and flower,<br/>
sun and moon, and stars of light;<br/>
Lord of all, to thee we raise<br/>
this our hymn of grateful praise.

For the joy of ear and eye,<br/>
for the heart and mind's delight,<br/>
for the mystic harmony,<br/>
linking sense to sound and sight;<br/>
Lord of all, to thee we raise<br/>
this our hymn of grateful praise.

For the joy of human love,<br/>
brother, sister, parent, child,<br/>
friends on earth and friends above,<br/>
for all gentle thoughts and mild;<br/>
Lord of all, to thee we raise<br/>
this our hymn of grateful praise.

For thy church, that evermore<br/>
lifteth holy hands above,<br/>
offering up on every shore<br/>
her pure sacrifice of love;<br/>
Lord of all, to thee we raise<br/>
this our hymn of grateful praise.

For thyself, best Gift Divine,<br/>
to the world so freely given,[^2]<br/>
for that great, great love of thine,<br/>
peace on earth, and joy in heaven:<br/>
Lord of all, to thee we raise<br/>
this our hymn of grateful praise.

[^1]: Or "For the wonder of each hour"
[^2]: Or "To our race so freely given"
