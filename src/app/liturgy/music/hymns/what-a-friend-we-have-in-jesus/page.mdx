## History

"What a Friend We Have in Jesus" is a hymn written by the Irish-born Canadian poet and low-church Anglican [Joseph M. Scriven](/liturgy/music/composers/joseph-m-scriven) in 1855. Scriven wrote the poem—originally called "Pray Without Ceasing"—when his mother fell terribly ill. It was later set to music by American composer Charles Crozat Converse in 1868.

## Text

What a friend we have in Jesus,<br/>
all our sins and griefs to bear!<br/>
What a privilege to carry<br/>
everything to God in prayer!<br/>
O what peace we often forfeit,<br/>
O what needless pain we bear,<br/>
all because we do not carry<br/>
everything to God in prayer.

Have we trials and temptations?<br/>
Is there trouble anywhere?<br/>
We should never be discouraged;<br/>
take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>
Can we find a friend so faithful<br/>
who will all our sorrows share?<br/>
Jesus knows our every weakness;<br/>
take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,<br/>
cumbered with a load of care?<br/>
Precious Savior, still our refuge;<br/>
take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?<br/>
Take it to the Lord in prayer!<br/>
In his arms he'll take and shield thee;<br/>
thou wilt find a solace there.
