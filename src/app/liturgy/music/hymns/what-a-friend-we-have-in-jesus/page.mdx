## History

"What a Friend We Have in Jesus" is a hymn written by the Irish-born Canadian poet and low-church Anglican [Joseph M. Scriven](/liturgy/music/composers/joseph-m-scriven) in 1855. Scriven wrote the poem—originally called "Pray Without Ceasing"—when his mother fell terribly ill. It was later set to music by American composer Charles Crozat Converse in 1868.

## Text

<Poetry>
|  What a friend we have in Jesus,
|  all our sins and griefs to bear!
|  What a privilege to carry
|  everything to God in prayer!
|  O what peace we often forfeit,
|  O what needless pain we bear,
|  all because we do not carry
|  everything to God in prayer.
|
|  Have we trials and temptations?
|  Is there trouble anywhere?
|  We should never be discouraged;
|  take it to the Lord in prayer.
|  Can we find a friend so faithful
|  who will all our sorrows share?
|  Jesus knows our every weakness;
|  take it to the Lord in prayer.
|
|  Are we weak and heavy laden,
|  cumbered with a load of care?
|  Precious Savior, still our refuge;
|  take it to the Lord in prayer.
|  Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
|  Take it to the Lord in prayer!
|  In his arms he'll take and shield thee;
|  thou wilt find a solace there.
</Poetry>
