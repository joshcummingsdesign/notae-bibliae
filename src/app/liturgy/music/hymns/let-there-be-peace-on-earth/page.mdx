## History

"Let There Be Peace on Earth" is a song written by [Jill Jackson-Miller](/liturgy/music/composers/jill-jackson-miller) (American actress) and her husband [Sy Miller](/liturgy/music/composers/sy-miller) (American songwriter) in 1955. It was initially written for and sung by the International Children's Choir. Jackson-Miller, who had been suicidal after the failure of her marriage to screenwriter Felix Jackson, later said she wrote the song after discovering what she called "the life-saving joy of God's peace and unconditional love". The song is performed worldwide throughout the year, and particularly during the Christmas season, which has led to it being considered a Christmas song. It is included in the hymnals of a variety of Christian denominations.

## Text

Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me;<br/>
let there be peace on earth, the peace that was meant to be.<br/>
With God our creator, children all are we.[^1]<br/>
Let us walk with each other in perfect harmony.[^2]

Let peace begin with me, let this be the moment now.<br/>
With every step I take, may this be my solemn vow:[^3]<br/>
To take each moment and live each moment<br/>
in peace eternally.<br/>
Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me.

[^1]: Or "With God as our Father, we are family" or "With God as our Father, brothers all are we"
[^2]: Or "Let me walk with my brother in perfect harmony"
[^3]: Or "let this be my solemn vow"
