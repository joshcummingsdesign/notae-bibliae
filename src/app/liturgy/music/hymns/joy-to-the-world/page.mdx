## History

"Joy to the World" was written by English minister and hymnist [Isaac Watts](/liturgy/music/composers/isaac-watts). It was first published in 1719 in Watts' collection *The Psalms of David: Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, and Applied to the Christian State and Worship*. "Joy to the World" was based on Psalm 98, and was not originally intended to be used as a Christmas Carol, but rather to reflect Christ's second coming. In 1848, American Composer Lowell Mason adapted the tune of [Handel's](/liturgy/music/composers/george-frideric-handel) "Antioch" and set Watts' words to it, and over time it became the most published Christmas hymn in North America.

<Poetry>
|  Joy to the world! the Lord is come;
|  Let Earth receive her King;
|  Let every heart prepare him room,
|  And heaven and nature sing,
|  And heaven and nature sing,
|  And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.
|
|  Joy to the world! the Saviour reigns;
|  Let men their songs employ;
|  While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
|  Repeat the sounding joy,
|  Repeat the sounding joy,
|  Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
|
|  No more let sins and sorrows grow,
|  Nor thorns infest the ground;
|  He comes to make his blessings flow
|  Far as the curse is found,
|  Far as the curse is found,
|  Far as, far as, the curse is found.
|
|  He rules the world with truth and grace,
|  And makes the nations prove
|  The glories of his righteousness,
|  And wonders of his love,
|  And wonders of his love,
|  And wonders, wonders, of his love.
</Poetry>
