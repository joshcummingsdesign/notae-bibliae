## History

"Joy to the World" was written by English minister and hymnist [Isaac Watts](/liturgy/music/composers/isaac-watts). It was first published in 1719 in Watts' collection *The Psalms of David: Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, and Applied to the Christian State and Worship*. "Joy to the World" was based on Psalm 98, and was not originally intended to be used as a Christmas Carol, but rather to reflect Christ's second coming. In 1848, American Composer Lowell Mason adapted the tune of [Handel's](/liturgy/music/composers/george-frideric-handel) "Antioch" and set Watts' words to it, and over time it became the most published Christmas hymn in North America.

Joy to the world! the Lord is come;<br/>
Let Earth receive her King;<br/>
Let every heart prepare him room,<br/>
And heaven and nature sing,<br/>
And heaven and nature sing,<br/>
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.

Joy to the world! the Saviour reigns;<br/>
Let men their songs employ;<br/>
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains<br/>
Repeat the sounding joy,<br/>
Repeat the sounding joy,<br/>
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,<br/>
Nor thorns infest the ground;<br/>
He comes to make his blessings flow<br/>
Far as the curse is found,<br/>
Far as the curse is found,<br/>
Far as, far as, the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,<br/>
And makes the nations prove<br/>
The glories of his righteousness,<br/>
And wonders of his love,<br/>
And wonders of his love,<br/>
And wonders, wonders, of his love.
