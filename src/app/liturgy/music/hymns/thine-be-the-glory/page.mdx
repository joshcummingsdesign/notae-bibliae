## History

In 1884, Swiss Free Church pastor [Edmond Louis Budry](/liturgy/music/composers/edmond-louis-budry) wrote the Easter hymn *"À toi la gloire O Ressuscité"* (French: "To You the Glory O Risen One") set to the tune of [Handel's](/liturgy/music/composers/george-frideric-handel) "See, the Conquering Hero Comes!", which was originally composed for Handel's oratorio *Joshua* (1747) and was later added to Handel's oratorio *Judas Maccabaeus* (1746) in around 1751. Budry was inspired to write the hymn after the death of his wife. In 1885 it was published in the French hymnnal *Chants Evangéliques* (French: "Gospel Songs"). The hymn was first translated from French into English by English Baptist minister Richard Birch Hoyle in 1923.

<Poetry>
|  Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son;
|  endless is the vict'ry thou o'er death hast won.
|  Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
|  kept the folded grave-clothes where thy body lay.
|  Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son;
|  endless is the vict'ry thou o'er death hast won.
|
|  Lo, Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb.
|  Lovingly he greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
|  let the Church with gladness hymns of triumph sing,
|  for the Lord now liveth; death hath lost its sting.
|  Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son;
|  endless is the vict'ry thou o'er death hast won.
|
|  No more we doubt Thee, glorious Prince of life!
|  Life is naught without thee; aid us in our strife;
|  make us more than conqu'rors, through thy deathless love;
|  bring us safe through Jordan to thy home above.
|  Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son;
|  endless is the vict'ry thou o'er death hast won.
</Poetry>
