## Text

<Poetry>
|  I want to walk as a child of the light.
|  I want to follow Jesus.
|  God set the stars to give light to the world.
|  The star of my life is Jesus.
|
|  **Refrain**
|  In him there is no darkness at all.
|  The night and the day are both alike.
|  The Lamb is the light of the city of God.
|  Shine in my heart, Lord Jesus.
|
|  I want to see the brightness of God.
|  I want to look at Jesus.
|  Clear sun of righteousness, shine on my path,
|  and show me the way to the Father.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  I'm looking for the coming of Christ.
|  I want to be with Jesus.
|  When we have run with patience the race,
|  we shall know the joy of Jesus.
|  *Refrain*
</Poetry>
