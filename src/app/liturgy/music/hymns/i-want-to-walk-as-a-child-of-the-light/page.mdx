## Text

I want to walk as a child of the light.<br/>
I want to follow Jesus.<br/>
God set the stars to give light to the world.<br/>
The star of my life is Jesus.

**Refrain**<br/>
In him there is no darkness at all.<br/>
The night and the day are both alike.<br/>
The Lamb is the light of the city of God.<br/>
Shine in my heart, Lord Jesus.

I want to see the brightness of God.<br/>
I want to look at Jesus.<br/>
Clear sun of righteousness, shine on my path,<br/>
and show me the way to the Father.<br/>
*Refrain*

I'm looking for the coming of Christ.<br/>
I want to be with Jesus.<br/>
When we have run with patience the race,<br/>
we shall know the joy of Jesus.<br/>
*Refrain*
