## History

"Jesus Loves Me" is a Christian hymn written by American writer [Anna Bartlett Warner](/liturgy/music/composers/anna-bartlett-warner). It was written in 1859, and was included in the 1860 novel *Say and Seal*, written by her older sister Susan Warner, in which the words were spoken as a comforting poem to a dying child. Warner's original version had four stanzas. The tune was added in 1862 by American musician William B. Bradbury. Along with his tune, Bradbury added his own chorus "Yes, Jesus loves me." In 1971, Canadian Anglican priest David Rutherford McGuire shortened the hymn to just three stanzas and altered the words to make them more accessible to contemporary audiences. This version was published in *The Hymn Book of the Anglican Church of Canada and the United Church of Canada* (1971). This version is still popular today, though Warner's original first verse is often retained.

|  Jesus loves me, this I know,
|  For the Bible tells me so.
|  Little ones to him belong,
|  They are weak, but he is strong.

|  Yes, Jesus loves me.
|  Yes, Jesus loves me.
|  Yes, Jesus loves me.
|  The Bible tells me so.
|
|  Jesus loves me, this I know,
|  As he loved so long ago,
|  Taking children on his knee,
|  Saying, "Let them come to me."
|  *Refrain*
|
|  Jesus loves me still today,
|  Walking with me on my way,
|  Waiting as a friend to give
|  Light and love to all who live.
|  *Refrain*
