## History

"Praise to the Lord, the Almighty" is based on the German hymn *"Lobe den Herren, den mächtigen König der Ehren"* (German: "Praise the Lord, the Mighty King of Honor") by [Joachim Neander](/liturgy/music/composers/joachim-neander) published in 1680. The text paraphrases Psalm 103 and Psalm 150. The hymn is set to a 17th-century German folk tune by an unknown author. It was translated into English by English translator and hymnist Catherine Winkworth in 1863.

<Poetry>
|  Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
|  O my soul, praise him, for he is thy health and salvation!
|  All ye who hear,
|  brothers and sisters draw near;
|  praise him in glad adoration.
|
|  Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
|  shelters thee under his wings, yea, so gently sustaineth.
|  Hast thou not seen
|  all that is needful hath been
|  granted in what he ordaineth?
|
|  Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee,
|  surely his goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.
|  Ponder anew
|  what the Almighty can do;
|  he through his love doth befriend thee.
|
|  Praise to the Lord, who, when tempests their warfare are waging,
|  who, when the elements madly around thee are raging.
|  Biddeth them cease,
|  turneth their fury to peace;
|  whirlwinds and waters assuaging.
|
|  Praise to the Lord, who when darkness of sin is abounding,
|  who when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding.
|  Sheddeth his light,
|  chaseth the horrors of night;
|  saints with his mercy surrounding.
|
|  Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore him!
|  All that hath life and breath come now with praises before him!
|  Let the Amen
|  sound from his people again;
|  gladly for aye we adore him.
</Poetry>
