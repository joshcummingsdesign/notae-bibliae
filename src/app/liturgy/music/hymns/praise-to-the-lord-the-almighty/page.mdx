## History

"Praise to the Lord, the Almighty" is based on the German hymn "*Lobe den Herren, den mächtigen König der Ehren*" (German: "Praise the Lord, the Mighty King of Honor") by [Joachim Neander](/liturgy/music/composers/joachim-neander) published in 1680. The text paraphrases Psalm 103 and Psalm 150. The hymn is set to a 17th century German folk tune by an unknown author. It was translated into English by English translator and hymnist Catherine Winkworth in 1863.

## Text

Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!<br/>
O my soul, praise him, for he is thy health and salvation!<br/>
All ye who hear,<br/>
brothers and sisters draw near;<br/>
praise him in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,<br/>
shelters thee under his wings, yea, so gently sustaineth.<br/>
Hast thou not seen<br/>
all that is needful hath been<br/>
granted in what he ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee,<br/>
surely his goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.<br/>
Ponder anew<br/>
what the Almighty can do;<br/>
he through his love doth befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord, who, when tempests their warfare are waging,<br/>
who, when the elements madly around thee are raging.<br/>
Biddeth them cease,<br/>
turneth their fury to peace;<br/>
whirlwinds and waters assuaging.

Praise to the Lord, who when darkness of sin is abounding,<br/>
who when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding.<br/>
Sheddeth his light,<br/>
chaseth the horrors of night;<br/>
saints with his mercy surrounding.

Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore him!<br/>
All that hath life and breath come now with praises before him!<br/>
Let the Amen<br/>
sound from his people again;<br/>
gladly for aye we adore him.
