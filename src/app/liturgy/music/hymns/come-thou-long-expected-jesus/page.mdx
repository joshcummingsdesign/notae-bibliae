## History

In 1744, [Charles Wesley](/liturgy/music/composers/charles-wesley) considered Haggai 2:7 and looked at the situation of orphans in the areas around him. He also looked at the class divide in Great Britain. Through this train of thought, he wrote "Come, Thou long Expected Jesus" and a published prayer at the time which had the words:

> "Born your people to deliver, born a child and yet a King, born to reign in us forever, now your gracious kingdom bring. By your own eternal Spirit, rule in all our hearts alone; by your all sufficient merit, raise us to your glorious throne. Amen."
>
> <cite>Charles Wesley</cite>

Wesley adapted this prayer into a hymn in 1744 and published it in his *Hymns for the Nativity of our Lord* hymnal. Wesley wrote "Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus" with the intent for people to remember Advent and Christmas as commemorating the Nativity of Jesus and preparing for the Second Coming.

It is often sung to the tune of "Stuttgart" by German composer Christian Friedrich Witt, which had been written in 1716.

<Poetry>
|  Come, thou long expected Jesus,
|  born to set thy people free;
|  from our fears and sins release us,
|  let us find our rest in thee.
|  Israel's strength and consolation,
|  hope of all the earth thou art;
|  dear desire of every nation,
|  joy of every longing heart.
|
|  Born thy people to deliver,
|  born a child and yet a King,
|  born to reign in us forever,
|  now thy gracious kingdom bring.
|  By thine own eternal spirit
|  rule in all our hearts alone;
|  by thine all sufficient merit,
|  raise us to thy glorious throne.
</Poetry>
