## History

"The First Nowell" is of Cornish origin (Cornwall, southwest England) most likely from the 16th century, although possibly earlier. Its current form was first published in 1823 by English authors William Sandys and Davies Gilbert. "Nowell" is an Early Modern English synonym of "Christmas" from the French word *Noël*, meaning "the Christmas season". The word was regularly used in carols in the Middle Ages towards the early modern period.

<Poetry>
|  The first Noel the angel did say
|  Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
|  In fields where they lay, keeping their sheep,
|  On a cold winter's night that was so deep:
|  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
|  Born is the King of Israel.
|
|  They looked up and saw a star,
|  Shining in the east, beyond them far:
|  And to the earth it gave great light,
|  And so it continued both day and night:
|  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
|  Born is the King of Israel.
|
|  And by the light of that same star,
|  Three Wise Men came from country far;
|  To seek for a King was their intent,
|  And to follow the star whersoever it went:
|  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
|  Born is the King of Israel.
|
|  This star drew nigh to the north-west;
|  O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
|  And there it did both stop and stay
|  Right over the place where Jesus lay:
|  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
|  Born is the King of Israel.
|
|  Then entered in those Wise Men three,
|  Full reverently upon their knee,
|  And offered there in his presence,
|  Their gold and myrrh and frankincense:
|  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
|  Born is the King of Israel.
|
|  Then let us all with one accord
|  Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
|  That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
|  And with his blood mankind hath bought:[^1]
|  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
|  Born is the King of Israel.
