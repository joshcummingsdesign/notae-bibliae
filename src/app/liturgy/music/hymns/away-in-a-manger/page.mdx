## History

"Away in a Manger" is a children's lullaby about the Nativity which first appeared in the *Christian Cynosure* (an American journal) in 1882 under the heading "Luther's Cradle Song". It included the text, "The following hymn, composed by Martin Luther for his children, is still sung by many of the German mothers to their little ones." Luther did write a children's song about the Nativity for his son Hans called "*Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her*" (German: "From Heaven Above to Earth I Come"), however, it was a different song altogether, and no earlier German versions of "Away in a Manger" have been found. Some have suggested that the song may have originated in a little play for children to act or a story about Luther celebrating Christmas with his children. The melody was first published under the title "Luther's Cradle Hymn" by American composer James R. Murray in his collection *Dainty Songs for Little Lads and Lasses* (1887). Murray attributed the song to Luther and placed only his initials where the composer's name is normally given, thus his melody appeared without credit in several subsequent publications. By 1914, the melody was attributed to Carl Mueller (whose identity is unknown), and the tune is widely known as "Mueller" as a result. The standard melody in Britain, Ireland, and Canada is "Cradle Song", which was written by the American hymnist William J. Kirkpatrick, and was first published as part of the collection *Around the World with Christmas* (1895).

## Text

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,<br/>
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.<br/>
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay,[^1]<br/>
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,[^2]<br/>
But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.<br/>
I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky,<br/>
And stay by my side till morning is nigh.[^3]

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay<br/>
Close by me forever, and love me I pray.<br/>
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,<br/>
And fit us for heaven to live with thee there.[^4]

[^1]: Or "The stars in the bright sky"
[^2]: Or "The poor baby wakes"
[^3]: Or "And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh"
[^4]: Or "And take us to heaven to live with thee there."
