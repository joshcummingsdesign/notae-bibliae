## History

*Abendlied* (German: "Evening song") is a sacred motet for a six-part mixed choir by German Catholic composer [Josef Rheinberger](/liturgy/music/composers/josef-rheinberger). The text is a verse from the biblical narration of the Road to Emmaus appearance according to Luke 24:29 in Martin Luther's German translation of the Bible. Rheinberger wrote the song on March 9, 1855, one month before Easter and two weeks before his 16th birthday.
