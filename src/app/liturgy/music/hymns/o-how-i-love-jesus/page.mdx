## Text

<Poetry>
|  There is a name I love to hear,
|  I love to sing its worth;
|  it sounds like music in my ear,
|  the sweetest name on earth.
|
|  **Refrain**
|  O how I love Jesus,
|  O how I love Jesus,
|  O how I love Jesus,
|  because he first loved me!
|
|  It tells me of a Savior's love,
|  who died to set me free;
|  it tells me of his precious blood,
|  the sinner's perfect plea.
|  *Refrain*
|
|  It tells of one whose loving heart
|  can feel my deepest woe;
|  who in each sorrow bears a part
|  that none can bear below.
|  *Refrain*
</Poetry>
