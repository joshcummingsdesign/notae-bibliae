## Text

There is a name I love to hear,<br/>
I love to sing its worth;<br/>
it sounds like music in my ear,<br/>
the sweetest name on earth.

**Refrain**<br/>
O how I love Jesus,<br/>
O how I love Jesus,<br/>
O how I love Jesus,<br/>
because he first loved me!

It tells me of a Savior's love,<br/>
who died to set me free;<br/>
it tells me of his precious blood,<br/>
the sinner's perfect plea.<br/>
*Refrain*

It tells of one whose loving heart<br/>
can feel my deepest woe;<br/>
who in each sorrow bears a part<br/>
that none can bear below.<br/>
*Refrain*
