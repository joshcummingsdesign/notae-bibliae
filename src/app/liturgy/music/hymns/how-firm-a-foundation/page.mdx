## History

"How Firm a Foundation" is a Christian hymn, published in 1787 by English Baptist minister John Rippon (successor to John Gill at Carter Lane in Southwark) in *A Selection of Hymns from the Best Authors*, Intended to be an Appendix to Isaac Watts' *Psalms and Hymns*, known as "Rippon's Selection." How Firm a Foundation is number 128 in the 1787 first printing. It is attributed only to "K", which most likely refers to Robert Keen, precentor at Rippon's church. It is most often sung to the tune "Foundation" which first appeared in *A Compilation of Genuine Church Music* (1832) edited by American composer Joseph Funk.

<Poetry>
|  How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
|  Is laid for your faith in his excellent Word;
|  What more can he say than to you he hath said,
|  To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?
|
|  In every condition, in sickness, in health,
|  In poverty's vale, or abounding in wealth;
|  At home and abroad, on the land on the sea,
|  As thy days may demand, shall thy strength ever be.
|
|  Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismay'd,
|  For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
|  I'll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand,
|  Upheld by my righteous omnipotent hand.
|
|  When thro' the deep waters I call thee to go,
|  The rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;
|  For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
|  And sanctify to thee, thy deepest distress.
|
|  When thro' fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
|  My grace all sufficient shall be thy supply;
|  The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design
|  Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.
|
|  Even down to old age, all my people shall prove
|  My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
|  And then hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,
|  Like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne.
|
|  The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose,
|  I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
|  That soul, tho' all hell should endeavor to shake,
|  I'll never—no never—no never forsake.
</Poetry>
