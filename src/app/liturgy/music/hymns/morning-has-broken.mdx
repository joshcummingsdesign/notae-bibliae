## History

"Morning Has Broken" is a hymn by English Anglican author [Eleanor Farjeon](/liturgy/music/composers/eleanor-farjeon) written in 1931. It is set to the traditional Scottish Gaelic tune, "Bunessan" (Scottish Gaelic: *Bun Easain*, "bottom of the waterfall", is a small village on the Isle of Mull off the west coast of Scotland). Eleanor wrote the hymn when she had been asked to make a poem to fit the lovely Scottish tune for the second edition of the hymnal *Songs of Praise*. There was a need for a hymn to give thanks for each day.

## Text

Morning has broken
Like the first morning,
Blackbird has spoken
Like the first bird.
Praise for the singing!
Praise for the morning!
Praise for them, springing
Fresh from the Word!

Sweet the rain's new fall
Sunlit from heaven,
Like the first dewfall
On the first grass.
Praise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden,
Sprung in completeness
Where his feet pass.

Mine is the sunlight!
Mine is the morning
Born of the one light
Eden saw play!
Praise with elation,
Praise every morning,
God's re-creation
Of the new day!
