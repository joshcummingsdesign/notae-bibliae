## History

"Hey, Ho, Nobody Home" originated in England in the 16th century. It was first published in *Pammelia*, a book of English rounds by Thomas Ravenscroft in 1609. The name *Pammelia* appears to derive from the Greek *melos* (μέλος), meaning "song," combined with the prefix pan-, yielding a sense of "All Songs". "Hey, Ho, Nobody Home" was a favorite of carolers who went from door to door at Christmas time, soliciting food and drink in exchange for their singing. The *Pammelia* version included the text, "Fill the pot Eadie", but other variations of the words can be found such as "Yet will I be merry" or "Yet shall we be merry", which is more fitting being that it is sung as a Christmas carol.
