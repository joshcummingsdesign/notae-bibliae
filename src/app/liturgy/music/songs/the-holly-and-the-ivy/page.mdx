## History

"The Holly and the Ivy" is a traditional British folk Christmas carol. The words of the carol occur in three broadsides published in Birmingham, England in the early 19th century. An early mention of the carol's title occurs in William Hone's 1823 work *Ancient Mysteries Described*, which includes "The holly and the ivy, now are both well grown" among an alphabetical list of "Christmas Carols, now annually printed" that were in the author's possession. The full lyrics of "The Holly and the Ivy" were first documented in a 1849 book review. The anonymous reviewer suggested replacing a passage from the discussed book with this carol, highlighting its simplicity and religious significance. They noted the value of traditional carols, often orally preserved, and praised a Birmingham-published collection for its blend of simplicity and doctrinal teaching. The reviewer included "The Holly and the Ivy" as an example, suggesting it as suitable for Christmas Day. "The Holly and the Ivy" was included in Sylvester's 1861 collection, *A Garland of Christmas Carols*, which attributed its origin to an old broadside from around 1711. Husk's 1864 *Songs of the Nativity* also featured the carol, noting its rarity among collectors and confirming its continued presence on Birmingham broadsides. The version which is now popular was collected in 1909 by the English folk song collector Cecil Sharp in the market town of Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, England, from a woman named Mary Clayton.

## Lyrics

The holly and the ivy<br/>
when they are both full grown,<br/>
of all the trees that are in the wood<br/>
the holly bears the crown.

**Refrain**<br/>
The rising of the sun<br/>
and the running of the deer,<br/>
the playing of the merry organ,<br/>
sweet singing in the choir.

The holly bears a blossom,<br/>
white as the lily flower,<br/>
and Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,<br/>
to be our sweet Saviour.<br/>
*Refrain*

The holly bears a berry,<br/>
as red as any blood,<br/>
and Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br/>
to do poor sinners good.<br/>
*Refrain*

The holly bears a prickle,<br/>
as sharp as any thorn,<br/>
and Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br/>
on Christmas day in the morn.<br/>
*Refrain*

The holly bears a bark,<br/>
as bitter as any gall,<br/>
and Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ<br/>
for to redeem us all.<br/>
*Refrain*
