## History

"Good King Wenceslas" is a Christmas carol that tells a story of the saint and martyr Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia (modern-day Czech Republic) who goes on a journey, braving harsh winter weather, to give alms to a poor peasant on the feast of [St. Stephen](/people/saints/biblical/stephen). During the journey, his page is about to give up the struggle against the cold weather, but is enabled to continue by following the king's footprints, step for step, through the deep snow. In 1853, English priest, scholar, and hymnist [Rev. Dr. John Mason Neale](/people/divines/john-mason-neale) wrote the lyrics in collaboration with his music editor [Thomas Helmore](/liturgy/music/composers/thomas-helmore) to fit the melody of the 13th-century spring carol *"Tempus adest floridum*" (Latin: "Eastertime Is Come"), which they had found in the 1582 Finnish song book *Piae Cantiones* (Latin: "Pious Songs"), a volume of 74 medieval songs with Latin texts collected by Jaakko Suomalainen, a Finnish Lutheran cleric, and published by T. P. Rutha, a Catholic printer.

## Lyrics

Good King Wenceslas looked out,<br/>
on the Feast of Stephen,<br/>
When the snow lay round about,<br/>
deep and crisp and even;<br/>
Brightly shone the moon that night,<br/>
tho' the frost was cruel,<br/>
When a poor man came in sight,<br/>
gath'ring winter fuel.

"Hither, page, and stand by me,<br/>
if thou know'st it, telling,<br/>
Yonder peasant, who is he?<br/>
Where and what his dwelling?"<br/>
"Sire, he lives a good league hence,<br/>
underneath the mountain;<br/>
Right against the forest fence,<br/>
by Saint Agnes' fountain."

"Bring me flesh, and bring me wine,<br/>
bring me pine logs hither:<br/>
Thou and I shall see him dine,<br/>
when we bear them thither."<br/>
Page and monarch, forth they went,<br/>
forth they went together;<br/>
Through the rude wind's wild lament<br/>
and the bitter weather.

"Sire, the night is darker now,<br/>
and the wind blows stronger;<br/>
Fails my heart, I know not how;<br/>
I can go no longer."<br/>
"Mark my footsteps, good my page;<br/>
Tread thou in them boldly:<br/>
Thou shalt find the winter's rage<br/>
Freeze thy blood less coldly."

In his master's steps he trod,<br/>
where the snow lay dinted;<br/>
Heat was in the very sod<br/>
which the saint had printed.<br/>
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,<br/>
wealth or rank possessing,<br/>
Ye who now will bless the poor,<br/>
shall yourselves find blessing.
