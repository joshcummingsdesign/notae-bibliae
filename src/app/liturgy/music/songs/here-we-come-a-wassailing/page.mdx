## History

"Here We Come A-Wassailing" is an English Christmas carol and New Year song. Wassailing is an old English tradition of caroling door to door carrying a wassail bowl filled with wassail, a spiced ale. Wassailing dates to the medieval period, and was traditionally done on the eve of Epiphany. The lord of the manor would give food and drink to the carolers in exchange for their blessing and goodwill. The earliest printed version of the song appeared in 1871 in the second edition of *Christmas Carols New and Old* by John Stainer—organist at St Paul's Cathedral, a famous Anglican cathedral in London.

## Lyrics

Here we come a-wassailing<br/>
Among the leaves so green;<br/>
here we come a-wand'ring<br/>
so fair to be seen.

**Refrain**<br/>
Love and joy come to you,<br/>
and to you your wassail too;<br/>
and God bless you and send you a happy New Year,<br/>
and God send you a happy New Year.

Our wassail cup is made<br/>
of the rosemary tree,<br/>
and so is your beer<br/>
of the best barley.<br/>
*Refrain*

We are not daily beggars<br/>
that beg from door to door;<br/>
but we are neighbours' children,<br/>
whom you have seen before.<br/>
*Refrain*

Call up the butler of this house,<br/>
put on his golden ring.<br/>
Let him bring us up a glass of beer,<br/>
and better we shall sing.<br/>
*Refrain*

We have got a little purse<br/>
of stretching leather skin;<br/>
we want a little of your money<br/>
to line it well within.<br/>
*Refrain*

Bring us out a table<br/>
and spread it with a cloth;<br/>
bring us out a mouldy cheese,<br/>
and some of your Christmas loaf.<br/>
*Refrain*

God bless the master of this house<br/>
likewise the mistress too,<br/>
and all the little children<br/>
that round the table go.<br/>
*Refrain*

Good master and good mistress,<br/>
while you're sitting by the fire,<br/>
pray think of us poor children<br/>
who are wandering in the mire.<br/>
*Refrain*
