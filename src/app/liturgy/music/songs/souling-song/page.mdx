## History

A soul cake is a small round cake traditionally made for Allhallowtide—All Saints' Eve (Halloween), All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day—to commemorate the dead in many Christian traditions. The cakes, often simply referred to as souls, are given out to "soulers" (mainly consisting of children and the poor) who go from door to door "souling" during the days of Allhallowtide singing and saying prayers for the souls of the givers and their friends, especially the souls of deceased relatives. The practice in England dates to the medieval period, and was continued there until the 1930s.

Souling was once performed throughout the British Isles and the earliest activity was reported in 1511, and Shakespeare mentioned "pulling like a beggar at Hallowmas" in *The Two Gentlemen of Verona* (1593). However, by the end of the 19th century, the extent of the practice during Allhallowtide was limited to parts of England and Wales.

The earliest printed versions of the song appeared in the early 19th century, and in 1891, Rev. M. P. Holme of Tattenhall, Cheshire, collected the song from a little girl at the local school. In 1893, the text and tune were published by folklorist Lucy Broadwood, who commented that souling was still practiced at that time in Cheshire and Shropshire.

Recordings of the song began to appear in the early 20th century, and in 1963 it was popularized by Peter, Paul, and Mary who added parts of ["Hey, Ho, Nobody Home"](/liturgy/music/songs/hey-ho-nobody-home) and ["God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"](/liturgy/music/hymns/god-rest-ye-merry-gentlemen) to it and titled it "A'soalin'".

## Lyrics

Hey, ho, nobody home<br/>
Meat nor drink nor money have I none<br/>
Yet, shall we be merry

Soul, a soul, a soul cake, please, good misses, a soul cake<br/>
An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry, any good thing to make us all merry<br/>
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for Him who made us all

God bless the master of this house, and the mistress also<br/>
And all the little children that round your table grow<br/>
The cattle in your stable, the dog by your front door<br/>
And all that dwell within your gates, we wish you ten times more

Soul, a soul, a soul cake, please, good missus, a soul cake<br/>
An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry, any good thing to make us all merry<br/>
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for Him who made us all

Go down into the cellar, and see what you can find<br/>
If the barrels are not empty<br/>
We hope you will be kind<br/>
We hope you will be kind<br/>
With your apple and strawber'<br/>
For we'll come no more a 'soalin this time next year

Soul, a soul, a soul cake, please, good missus, a soul cake<br/>
An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry, any good thing to make us all merry<br/>
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for Him who made us all

The streets are very dirty, my shoes are very thin<br/>
I have a little pocket to put a penny in<br/>
If you haven't got a penny, a ha' penny will do<br/>
If you haven't got a ha' penny, then God bless you

Soul, a soul, a soul cake, please, good missus, a soul cake<br/>
An apple, a pear, a plum, a cherry, any good thing to make us all merry<br/>
One for Peter, two for Paul, three for Him who made us all

Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place<br/>
And with true love and brotherhood, each other now embrace<br/>
This holy tide of Christmas of beauty and of grace<br/>
O tidings of comfort and joy
