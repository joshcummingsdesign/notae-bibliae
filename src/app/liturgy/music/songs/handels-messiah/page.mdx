## History

"Messiah" is an English-language oratorio (large-scale musical work for orchestra and voices) composed in 1741 by German-British composer [George Frideric Handel](/liturgy/music/composers/george-frideric-handel). The libretto (text of an opera or other long vocal work) was compiled from the King James Bible by Handel's dear friend [Charles Jennens](/liturgy/music/composers/charles-jennens).

In a time of rising secularism and humanism in England, Jennens was a member of the "Society for the Propagation of the Gospel" and a passionate evangelical believer. He believed that putting the gospel to music would communicate its truth, not just intellectually, but at a deep heart level.

The libretto was made up entirely of Old and New Testament texts combined to present the entire Christian message in a single piece. When it was finished he took it to his friend, the great composer, George Handel.

For 18 months the libretto sat on Handel's shelf gathering dust until one day he took it down, dusted it off, and in three intense weeks, shut up in his flat on Brook Street in London, composed the oratorio that made the words come alive. He barely ate or slept; he was completely engulfed in the creation of this music—and he wasn't alone. When he got to the Hallelujah chorus, his assistant found him in tears, saying, "I think I did see heaven open, and the very face of God."

The oratorio was first performed in Dublin on April 13, 1742 and received its London premier a year later in 1743. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.
