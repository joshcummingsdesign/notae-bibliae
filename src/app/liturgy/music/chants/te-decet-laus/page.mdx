## History

A doxology which appears in the 4th-century *Apostolic Constitutions*. The Latin version was in existence by the 6th century, when it was prescribed for use at [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins) in the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia). The words are an allusion to Ps. 65:1. In 1957, French Benedictine monks at Solesmes Abbey (northwest France) published two chant melodies for *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="te-decet-laus" text="Te Decet Laus" />* in *Cantus selecti* (Latin: "Selected Songs").
