<Poetry>
|  O come let _ us sing unto the Lord; *
|  let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our _ salvation.
|
|  Let us come before his pres_ence with thanksgiving; *
|  and show ourselves glad _ in him with psalms. \a
|
|  For the _ Lord is a great God; *
|  and a great King _ above all gods.
|
|  In his hand are all _ the corners of the earth; *
|  and the strength of the hills is _ his also.
|
|  The sea is _his and he made it; *
|  and his hands prepar-ed _ the dry land. \a
|
|  \G O come let us _ worship and fall down, *
|  and kneel before the Lord _ our Maker.
|
|  \U For _ he is the Lord our God; *
|  and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep _ of his hand. \a
|
|  To-day if ye will hear his _ voice harden not your hearts *
|  as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in _ the wilderness;
|
|  When your _ fathers tempted me, *
|  prov-ed me _ and saw my works.
|
|  Forty years long I was griev-ed with this ge_neration and said, *
|  It is a people that do err in their hearts for they have _ not known my ways.
|
|  Unto whom _ I sware in my wrath, *
|  that they should not enter in_to my rest. \a
|
|  Glory be to the _ Father and to the Son *
|  and to _ the Holy Ghost;
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now _ and ever shall be, *
|  world with_out end. Amen. \a
