## History

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="venite-exultemus-domino" text="Venite exultemus Domino" />, or "Venite" for short, is the Latin name for Psalm 95, the [Invitatory](/glossary/liturgical-terms#invitatory) for [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins). Its use in worship traces back to the Jewish temple and was carried forward by the early Jewish Christians, hence the exposition of the psalm in the third chapter of Hebrews (Heb. 3:7-19). [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) attests to its use in worship as early as the 4th century, and by the 6th century, it was prescribed as an opening psalm for Matins in the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*](/liturgy/rites/benedictine-rite/liturgy-of-the-hours).[^1][^2]

<Poetry>
|  O come let _ us sing unto the Lord; *
|  let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our _ salvation.
|
|  Let us come before his pres_ence with thanksgiving; *
|  and show ourselves glad _ in him with psalms. \a
|
|  For the _ Lord is a great God; *
|  and a great King _ above all gods.
|
|  In his hand are all _ the corners of the earth; *
|  and the strength of the hills is _ his also.
|
|  The sea is _ his and he made it; *
|  and his hands prepar-ed _ the dry land. \a
|
|  \G O come let us _ worship and fall down, *
|  and kneel before the Lord _ our Maker.
|
|  \U For _ he is the Lord our God; *
|  and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep _ of his hand. \a
|
|  To-day if ye will hear his _ voice harden not your hearts *
|  as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in _ the wilderness;
|
|  When your _ fathers tempted me, *
|  prov-ed me _ and saw my works.
|
|  Forty years long I was griev-ed with this ge_neration and said, *
|  It is a people that do err in their hearts for they have _ not known my ways.
|
|  Unto whom _ I sware in my wrath, *
|  that they should not enter in_to my rest. \a
|
|  Glory be to the _ Father and to the Son *
|  and to _ the Holy Ghost;
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now _ and ever shall be, *
|  world with_out end. Amen. \a
