## History

The Agnus Dei is an ancient liturgical chant. *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="agnus-dei" text='"Agnus Dei"' />* is Latin for "Lamb of God", and is a reference to Jesus Christ. It is based on the saying of John the Baptist, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29). In the Latin Mass, the Agnus Dei comes between the Lord's Prayer and the Eucharist, and has been part of the Mass since at least the 7th century. The Agnus Dei was published in the *Roman Missal* in 1570. Along with the [Kyrie](/liturgy/music/chants/kyrie), [Gloria](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria), [Credo](/liturgy/music/chants/credo), and [Sanctus](/liturgy/music/chants/sanctus), it is part of the Ordinary of the Mass, and is sung to many different tunes, depending on which particular Mass is being observed, e.g. Mass VIII and Mass XI. The above settings are from the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />* (1961).
