## History

The second part of the [canticle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#canticle) of Moses from Deuteronomy 32:1-43. After Moses announces to Israel in the plains of Moab that he will die before entering the promised land, and that Joshua is to succeed him, he tells them to write this song and to teach it to the people of Israel.

<Poetry>
|  For a fire is kindl-ed _ in mine anger, *
|  and shall burn _ unto the lowest hell;
|
|  And shall consume the earth _ with her increase, *
|  and set on fire the founda_tions of the mountains.
|
|  I will heap mis_chief upon them: *
|  I will spend mine _ arrows upon them.
|
|  They shall be burnt with hungˇer, +
|  and devour-ed with _ burning heat: *
|  and with _ bitter destruction.
|
|  I will also send the teeth of the _ beasts upon them, *
|  with the poison of _ serpents of the dust.
|
|  The sword without and terror with¯in +
|  shall destroy both the young man _ and the virgin: *
|  the suckling also with _ the man of gray hairs.
|
|  I said I would scatter them _ into corners, *
|  I would make the remembrance of them to _ cease from among men:
|
|  Were it not that I fear-ed the wrath _ of the enemy, *
|  lest their adversaries should be_have themselves strangely,
|
|  And lest they should say Our _ hand is high, *
|  and the _ Lord hath not done all this.
|
|  For they are a nation _ void of counsel, *
|  neither is there any un_derstanding in them.
|
|  O that they were wise that they _ understood this, *
|  that they would con_sider their latter end!
|
|  How should one _ chase a thousand, *
|  and two put _ ten thousand to flight,
|
|  Except their Rock had sold thˇem, +
|  and the Lord had _ shut them up? *
|  For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies them_selves being judges.
|
|  For their vine is of the vine of Sodˇom, +
|  and of the fields _ of Gomorrah: *
|  Their grapes are grapes of gall, their _ clusters are bitter.
|
|  Their wine is the poi_son of dragons, *
|  and the _ cruel venom of asps.
|
|  Is not this laid up in _ store with me, *
|  and seal-ed up _ among my treasures?
|
|  To me belongeth vengeance and _ recompence: *
|  their foot _ shall slide in due time.
|
|  For the day of their calamity _ is at hand, *
|  and the things that shall _ come upon them make haste.
|
|  For the Lord shall _ judge his people, *
|  and repent him_self for his servants,
|
|  When he seeth that their po_wer is gone, *
|  and there is _ none shut up, or left.
|
|  And he shall say Where _ are their gods, *
|  their rock _ in whom they trusted,
|
|  Which did eat the fat of their _ sacrifices, *
|  and drank the wine _ of their drink offerings?
|
|  Let them rise _ up and help you, *
|  and _ be your protection.
|
|  See now that I even _ I am he, *
|  and _ there is no god with me:
|
|  I kill, and I make ali¯ve, +
|  I wound _ and I heal; *
|  neither is there any that can deli_ver out of my hand.
|
|  For I lift up my hand to heav_en and say, *
|  _ I live for ever.
|
|  If I whet my glitt'ring sword and mine hand take _ hold on judgment; *
|  I will render vengeance to mine enemies and will re_ward them that hate me.
|
|  I will make mine _ arrows drunk with blood, *
|  and my _ sword shall devour flesh;
|
|  And that with the blood of the slain and _ of the captives, *
|  from the beginning of revenges _ upon the enemy.
|
|  Rejoice O ye nations _ with his people: *
|  for he will avenge the _ blood of his servants,
|
|  And will render vengeance to his _ adversaries, *
|  and will be merciful unto his land _ and to his people.
|
|  Glory be to the Father and _ to the Son, *
|  _ and to the Holy Ghost:
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now, and _ ever shall be: *
|  _ world without end. Amen.
