<Poetry>
|  \b O Adonai, et Dux domus Israel,
|  \b qui Moysi in igne flammae rubi apparuisti,
|  \b et ei in Sina legem dedisti:
|  \b veni ad redimendum nos in brachio extento.
|
|  **Literal**
|  O Adonai, and Leader of the house of Israel,
|  who appeared to Moses in the fire of the burning bush,
|  and gave him the law on Sinai:
|  come and redeem us with an outstretched arm.
|
|  **Paraphrase**
|  O come, O come, thou Lord of Might
|  Who to thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
|  In ancient times didst give the law,
|  In cloud, and majesty, and awe.
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel.
</Poetry>
