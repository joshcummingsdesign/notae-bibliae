## History

The Alleluia is an ancient chant that comes from the Latinized form of the the Hebrew word <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="halleluya" text='"hallelujah"' /> (cf. Ps. 104:35). The Alleluia is associated with joy, and is especially used during the time between Easter and Pentecost, perhaps because of its association with the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hallel" text="Egyptian Hallel Psalms" /> chanted at Passover. In the Mass, the Alleluia precedes the reading of the Gospel. It is excluded from the liturgy during Lent, and is then restored to regular liturgical use on Easter Sunday.

The setting below is from the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />* (1961).
