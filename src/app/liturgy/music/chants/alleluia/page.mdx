## History

Alleluia is the Latinized form of the Hebrew word <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="halleluya" text='"hallelujah"' /> (Ps. 104:35). The word "alleluia" is associated with joy, and is especially used during the time between Easter and Pentecost, perhaps because of the association of the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hallel" text="Egyptian Hallel Psalms" /> chanted at Passover. During this time, the word is added widely to verses, responses, antiphons, etc.

The Alleluia is used to designate a chant beginning and ending, in particular a chant to greet and welcome the Lord whose word will be proclaimed in the Gospel reading. The cantor sings, "Alleluia," and the congregation responds by repeating it. The cantor then sings a verse taken from the lectionary, after which the congregation again sings, "Alleluia".

The Alleluia is excluded from the liturgy during Lent, and is then restored to regular liturgical use on Easter Sunday.

The setting below is from the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />* (1961).
