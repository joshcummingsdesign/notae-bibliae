## History

The word *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="alleluia" text='"Alleluia"' />* is the Latinized form of the the Hebrew *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="halleluya" text='"hallelujah"' />* (cf. Ps. 104:35). Associated with joy, *Alleluia* is used especially during the season from Easter to Pentecost, partly because of its connection with the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hallel" text="Egyptian Hallel Psalms" /> chanted at Passover. Throughout this period, the word is widely added to verses, responses, antiphons, etc. It is omitted from the liturgy during Lent and restored to regular liturgical use on Easter Sunday.

"The Alleluia" signifies the part of the Mass where *Alleluia* is chanted before the reading of the Gospel.

The setting below is from the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />* (1961).
