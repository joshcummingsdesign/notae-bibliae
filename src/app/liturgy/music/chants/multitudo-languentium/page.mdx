## History

*Multitudo Languentium* is a communio based on Luke 6:17-19. It can be traced back to as early as the 8th century. In 1974, French Benedictine monks at Solesmes Abbey (northwest France) published a chant melody for *Multitudo Languentium* in *Graduale Romanum* (Latin: "Roman Gradual").

***veniebant ad eum:***<br/>

***et sanabat omnes.***<br/>
