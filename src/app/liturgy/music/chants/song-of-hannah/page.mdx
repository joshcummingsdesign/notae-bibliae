## History

A [canticle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#canticle) from 1 Samuel 2:1-10 by the prophet Samuel's mother Hannah. Hannah goes to worship at Shiloh, where Eli is priest, and Hannah vows that if the Lord answers her prayer for a child, he will be a Nazarite. Eli blesses her, and she returns home. The Lord remembers Hannah, and she bears a son, and she calls his name Samuel. This is her song of thanksgiving.

<Poetry>
|  My heart rejoiceth in the _ Lord, *
|  my strength is ex_alt-ed in the Lord.
|
|  My mouth is enlarged over mine _ enemies; *
|  because I rejoice in _ thy salvation.
|
|  There is none holy as the L¯ord; +
|  for there is none be_side thee: *
|  neither is there any _ rock like our God.
|
|  Talk no more so exceedingly _ proudly; *
|  let not arrogancy come _ out of your mouth.
|
|  For the Lord is a God of _ knowledge, *
|  and by him ac_tions are weigh-ed.
|
|  The bows of the mighty men are _ broken, *
|  and they that stumbl-ed are _ girded with strength.
|
|  They that were full have hir-ed out themselves for _ bread; *
|  and they that were hungry ceas_ed to hunger.
|
|  So that the barren hath born seven _ children; *
|  and she that hath many sons is _ wax-ed feeble.
|
|  The Lord killeth and maketh a_live: *
|  he bringeth down to the _ grave and bringeth up.
|
|  The Lord maketh poor and maketh _ rich: *
|  he bringeth _ low and lifteth up.
|
|  He raiseth up the poor out of the _ dust, *
|  and lifteth up the beggar _ from the ash heap,
|
|  To set them among _ princes, *
|  and to make them inherit the _ throne of glory:
|
|  For the pillars of the earth are the _ Lord's, *
|  and he hath set the _ world upon them.
|
|  He will guard the footsteps of his Sai¯nts, +
|  and the wicked shall be silent in _ darkness; *
|  for by strength shall _ no man prevail.
|
|  The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to _ pieces; *
|  out of heaven shall he thun_der upon them:
|
|  The Lord shall judge the ends of the ea¯rth, +
|  and he shall give strength unto his _ King, *
|  and exalt the horn of _ his Anointed.
|
|  Glory be to the Father and to the _ Son, *
|  and _ to the Holy Ghost:
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now, and ever _ shall be: *
|  world _ without end. Amen.
