## History

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="gloria-patri" text="Gloria Patri" />, also known as the "Glory Be", is an ancient doxology. It is also referred to as the Minor Doxology or Lesser Doxology, to distinguish it from the Greater Doxology, the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="gloria-in-excelsis-deo" text="Gloria in excelsis Deo" />*. Its origins can be traced back to the early centuries of Christianity, likely in the 2nd or 3rd century. It is one of the earliest doxologies, written as a short hymn to affirm the doctrine of the Trinity. The Gloria Patri became widely used in both Eastern and Western liturgies. The exact authorship is unclear, but it reflects the early Christian emphasis on the Trinity and the eternal nature of God. By the 4th century, it was firmly established as a regular part of Christian worship, particularly after the Council of Nicaea affirmed the doctrine of the Trinity. In 1961, French Benedictine monks at Solesmes Abbey (northwest France) published several chant melodies for the Gloria Patri in the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />*, e.g. Gloria Patri II.
