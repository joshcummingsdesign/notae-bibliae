## History

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="gloria-patri" text="Gloria Patri" />, also known as the "Glory Be", is an ancient [doxology](/glossary/liturgical-terms#doxology). It is referred to as the Minor Doxology, as distinguished from the [Gloria in excelsis Deo](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria) or Greater Doxology. The Trinitarian language harkens back to Jesus' words in the Great Commission (Matt. 28:19), and it came into liturgical use as early as the 4th century.[^1] It always occurs at the end of psalms and canticles, except for the [Benedicite](/liturgy/music/chants/benedicite).

|  \b Gloria Patri, et Filio,
