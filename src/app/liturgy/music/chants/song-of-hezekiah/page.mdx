<Initial text="Song of Hezekiah" />

## History

A [canticle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#canticle) from Isaiah 38:9-20. After Hezekiah—king of Judah—restored the temple in a way that hadn't been seen since Solomon, Assyria—who had already conquered Northern Israel—was threatening to invade Judah. Hezekiah becomes deathly ill, so he prays for healing, and the lord adds 15 years to his life. This is his hymn of thanksgiving.

<Poetry>
|  I said in the cutting off of my da¯ys, +
|  I shall go to the gates of the _ grave: *
|  I am deprived of the re_sidue of my years:
|
|  I said, I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the _ living: *
|  I shall behold man no more with the inhabi_tants of the world:
|
|  Mine age is de_part-ed, *
|  and is remov-ed from me _ as a shepherd's tent:
|
|  I have cut off like a weaver my l¯ife: +
|  he will cut me off with pining _ sickness: *
|  from day even to night wilt thou _ make an end of me.
|
|  I reckon-ed till morniˇng, +
|  that as a lion so will he break all my _ bones: *
|  from day even to night wilt thou _ make an end of me.
|
|  Like a crane or a swallow so did I _ chatter: *
|  I did mourn as a dove.
|
|  Mine eyes fail with looking _ upward: *
|  O Lord, I am oppressed; _ undertake for me.
|
|  What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath _ done it: *
|  I shall go softly all my years in the bitter_ness of my soul.
|
|  O Lord by these things men li¯ve, +
|  and in all these things is the life of my _ spirit: *
|  so wilt thou recover me and _ make me to live.
|
|  Behold for peace I had great bittˇernˇess: +
|  but thou hast in love to my soul deliver-ed it from the pit of cor_ruption: *
|  for thou hast cast all my _ sins behind thy back.
|
|  For the grave cannot praise thˇee, +
|  death can not cele_brate thee: *
|  they that go down into the pit cannot _ hope for thy truth.
|
|  The living, the living, he shall praise thee as I do this _ day: *
|  the father to the children shall _ make known thy truth.
|
|  The Lord was ready to save mˇe: +
|  therefore we will sing my songs to the string-ed _ instruments *
|  all the days of our life in the _ house of the Lord.
|
|  Glory be to the Father, and to the _ Son, *
|  and _ to the Holy Ghost:
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now, and ever _ shall be, *
|  world _ without end. Amen.
