## History

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="pascha-nostrum" text="Pascha nostrum" />, also called the "Eastertide Anthem", is an <Definition lang="greek" anchor="antiphona" text="anthem" /> which replaces the [Venite](/liturgy/music/chants/venite) on Easter Day in the Church of England, and may be sung through the week of Easter.[^1] It traces its roots to the ancient [Paschal greeting](/glossary/liturgical-terms#paschal-greeting), and was added to the [Sarum Rite](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sarum-rite) Easter liturgy in 1552.[^2] It made its way into the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, where the rubric was added that it should replace the Venite on Easter Day.[^3]

<Poetry>
|  **ALLELUIA.** Christ our Passover is sacrific-ed _ for us: *
|  therefore _ let us keep the feast,
|
|  Not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wick_edness; *
|  but with the unleaven-ed bread of sincerity and truth, _ alleluia.[^5]
|
|  **CHRIST** being rais-ed from the dead dieth _ no more; *
|  death hath no more do_minion over him.
|
|  For in that he di-ed he di-ed unto _ sin once: *
|  but in that he liveth he _ liveth unto God.
|
|  Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed un_to sin, *
|  but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord, _ alleluia.[^6]
|
|  **CHRIST** is risen from _ the dead, *
|  and become the first_fruits of them that slept.
|
|  For since by man _ came death, *
|  by man came also the resur_rection of the dead.
|
|  For as in Adam _ all die, *
|  even so in Christ shall _ all be made alive.[^7]
|
|  Glory be to the Father and _ to the Son *
|  and _ to the Holy Ghost;
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now and ever _ shall be, *
|  world without end. Amen, _ alleluia.
