## History

*Domine Labia Mea* is a versicle based on Psalm 51:15. In the 6th century it was prescribed for use at [Matins](/liturgy/rites/liturgy-of-the-hours-benedictine-rite#matins) in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*. In 2002, German Gregorian Chant scholar Holger Peter Sandhofe published a chant melody for *Domine Labia Mea* in *Nocturnale Romanum* (Latin: "Roman Nocturnal").
