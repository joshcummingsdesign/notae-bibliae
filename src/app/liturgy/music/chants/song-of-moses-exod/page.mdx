<Poetry>
|  I will sing unto the Lord for he hath _ triumph'd glo-rious-ly: *
|  the horse and his rider hath he _ thrown into the sea.
|
|  The Lord is my strength and song, *
|  and he is become _ my salvation:
|
|  He is my God and I will prepare him an _ habitation; *
|  my father's God, and I _ will exalt him.
|
|  The Lord _ is a man of war: *
|  the _ Lord is his Name.
|
|  Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast _ into the sea: *
|  his chosen captains also are drown-ed _ in the Red sea.
|
|  The depths have _ cover-ed them: *
|  they sank into the _ bottom as a stone.
|
|  Thy right hand O Lord is become _ glo-rio-us in pow-er: *
|  thy right hand O Lord hath dash-ed in pie_ces the enemy.
|
|  And in the greatness of thine excellˇenˇcy +
|  thou hast overthrown them that rose _ up against thee: *
|  thou sentest forth thy wrath which consum-ed them as stubble.
|
|  And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gather_ed together, *
|  the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congeal-ed in the _ heart of the sea.
|
|  The enemy said _ I will pursue, *
|  I will overtake, I _ will divide the spoil;
|
|  My lust shall be satis_fi-ed upon them; *
|  I will draw my sword, my hand _ shall destroy them.
|
|  Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea _ cover-ed them: *
|  they sank as lead in the _ mighty waters.
|
|  Who is like unto thee O _ Lord among the gods? *
|  Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, _ doing wonders?
|
|  Thou stretch-ed _ out thy right hand, *
|  and the _ earth swallow-ed them.
|
|  Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which _ thou hast redeem-ed: *
|  thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy _ habitation.
|
|  The people shall _ hear and be afraid: *
|  sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of _ Palestina.
|
|  Then the dukes of Edom shall be amaz-ˇed; +
|  the mighty men of Moab trembling shall take _ hold upon them: *
|  all the inhabitants of Ca_naan shall melt away.
|
|  Fear and dread shall _ fall upon them: *
|  by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as _ still as a stone;
|
|  Till thy people pass _ over O Lord, *
|  till the people pass over, which _ thou hast purchas-ed.
|
|  Thou _ shalt bring them in: *
|  and plant them in the mountain of _ thine inheritance.
|
|  In the place O Lord which thou hast made for _ thee to dwell in; *
|  in the Sanctuary O Lord which thy hands _ have establish-ed.
|
|  The Lord shall reign for _ ever and ever: *
|  for the horse of Pharaoh went in _ with his cha-ri-ots;
|
|  And the Lord brought again the waters of the _ sea upon them; *
|  but the children of Israel went on dry land in the _ midst of the sea.
|
|  Glory be to the _ Father and to the Son, *
|  and _ to the Holy Ghost:
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now, and _ ever shall be: *
|  world _ without end. Amen.
