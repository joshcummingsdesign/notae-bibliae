<Poetry>
|  \b O Radix Jesse, qui stas in signum populorum,
|  \b super quem continebunt reges os suum,
|  \b quem gentes deprecabuntur:
|  \b veni ad liberandum nos, jam noli tardare.
|
|  **Literal**
|  O Root of Jesse, standing as a sign among the peoples,
|  before you kings will shut their mouths,
|  to you the nations will make their prayer:
|  come and deliver us, and delay no longer.
|
|  **Paraphrase**
|  O come, thou Root of Jesse's tree,
|  Free them from Satan's tyranny,
|  That trust thy mighty power to save,
|  And give them victory o'er the grave.
|  Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
|  Shall come to thee, O Israel.
</Poetry>
