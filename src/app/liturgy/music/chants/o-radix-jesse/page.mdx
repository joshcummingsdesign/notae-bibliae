<Poetry>
|  \b O Radix Jesse, qui stas in signum populorum,
|  \b super quem continebunt reges os suum,
|  \b quem gentes deprecabuntur:
|  \b veni ad liberandum nos, jam noli tardare.
|
|  O Root of Jesse, standing as a sign among the peoples,
|  before you kings will shut their mouths,
|  to you the nations will make their prayer:
|  come and deliver us, and delay no longer.
</Poetry>
