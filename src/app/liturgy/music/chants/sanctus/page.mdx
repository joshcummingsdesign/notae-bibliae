## History

The Sanctus is an ancient liturgical chant. *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="sanctus" text='"Sanctus"' />* is Latin for "holy", and comes from Isaiah 6:3 where the threefold repetition of the word is said by the seraphim before God. The text of the second part, beginning with the word *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="benedictus" text='"benedictus"' />*, is taken from Matthew 21:9, and describes Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday where the people shout, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" and "Hosanna in the highest!". The word "hosanna" means "O save!", and it comes from the Hebrew *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hoshia-na" text="hoshia na" />* (Ps. 118:25-26). It was used to address kings. The Sanctus is one of the elements of the liturgy of which we have the earliest evidence. [St. Clement](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers/clement-of-rome) mentions it in the 1st century. It is found in the *Apostolic Constitutions* (4th Century), and was published in the *Roman Missal* in 1570. Along with the [Kyrie](/liturgy/music/chants/kyrie), [Gloria](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria), [Credo](/liturgy/music/chants/credo), and [Agnus Dei](/liturgy/music/chants/agnus-dei), it is part of the Ordinary of the Mass, and is sung to many different tunes, depending on which particular Mass is being observed, e.g. Mass VIII and Mass XVIII.
