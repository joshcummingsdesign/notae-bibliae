<Poetry>
|  O Lord I have heard thy speech and _ was afraid: *
|  O Lord revive thy work in the midst _ of the years:
|
|  In the midst of the _ years make known: *
|  in wrath remem_ber mercy.
|
|  God came from Teman and the Holy One _ from mount Paran: *
|  His glory cover-ed the heavens and the earth was full _ of his praise.
|
|  And his brightness was as the li¯ght; +
|  he had horns coming out _ of his hand: *
|  and there was the hiding of _ his power.
|
|  Before him _ went the pestilence, *
|  and burning coals went forth _ at his feet.
|
|  He stood and measured the earth: *
|  he beheld and drove asunder _ the nations;
|
|  And the everlasting mountains were scattˇer-ˇed, +
|  the perpe_tu-al hills did bow: *
|  his ways are everlasting.
|
|  I saw the tents of Cushan _ in affliction: *
|  and the curtains of the land of Midian _ did tremble.
|
|  Was the Lord displeas-ed a_gainst the rivers? *
|  was thine anger against _ the rivers?
|
|  Was thy wrath a_gainst the sea, *
|  that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of _ salvation?
|
|  Thy bow was _ made quite naked, *
|  according to the oaths of the tribes, e_ven thy word.
|
|  Thou didst cleave the _ earth with rivers: *
|  the mountains saw thee and _ they trembled:
|
|  The overflowing of the water _ passed by: *
|  the deep utter-ed his voice and lifted up _ his hands on high.
|
|  The sun and moon stood still in their habitatiˇon: +
|  at the light of thine _ arrows they went, *
|  and at the shining of _ thy glittering spear.
|
|  Thou didst march through the land in _ indignation, *
|  thou didst thresh the heathen _ in anger.
|
|  Thou wentest forth for the salvation _ of thy people, *
|  even for salvation with thine _ Anointed;
|
|  Thou woundedst the head out of the house _ of the wicked, *
|  by discovering the foundation un_to the neck.
|
|  Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villˇagˇes: +
|  they came out as a whirl_wind to scatter me: *
|  their rejoicing was as to devour the _ poor secretly.
|
|  Thou didst walk through the sea _ with thine horses, *
|  through the heap of _ great waters.
|
|  When I heard, my _ belly trem-bl-ed: *
|  my lips quiver-ed _ at the voice.
|
|  Rottenness enter-ed _ into my bones, *
|  and I trem-bl-ed _ in myself.
|
|  That I might rest in the day of trouˇble: +
|  when he cometh up un_to the people: *
|  he will invade them _ with his troops.
|
|  Although the fig tree _ shall not blossom, *
|  neither shall fruit be _ in the vines;
|
|  The labour of the o_live shall fail, *
|  and the fields shall _ yield no meat;
|
|  The flock shall be cut off _ from the fold, *
|  and there shall be no herd _ in the stalls:
|
|  Yet I will rejoice _ in the Lord, *
|  I will joy in the God of my _ salvation.
|
|  The Lord God is my stre¯ngth, +
|  and he will make my _ feet like hinds' feet: *
|  and he will make me to walk upon mine _ high places.
|
|  Glory be to the Father and _ to the Son, *
|  and to _ the Holy Ghost:
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now, and _ ever shall be: *
|  world with_out end. Amen.
