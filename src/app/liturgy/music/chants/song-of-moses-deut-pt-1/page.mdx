## History

The first part of the [canticle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#canticle) of Moses from Deuteronomy 32:1-43. After Moses announces to Israel in the plains of Moab that he will die before entering the promised land, and that Joshua is to succeed him, he tells them to write this song and to teach it to the people of Israel.

## Text

<Poetry>
|  Give ear O ye _ heavens and I will speak: *
|  and hear O _ earth and I will speak.
|
|  My doctrine shall drop _ as the rain, *
|  my speech shall dis_til as the dew:
|
|  As the small rain up_on the tender herb, *
|  and as the _ showers upon the grass:
|
|  Because I will publish the _ Name of the Lord: *
|  ascribe ye greatness _ unto our God.
|
|  He is the Rock, his work is perfˇect: +
|  for all his _ ways are judgment: *
|  a God of truth and without iniquity, _ just and right is he.
|
|  They have corrupted themsel¯ves, _
|  their spot is not the _ spot of his children: *
|  they are a perverse and crooked _ generation.
|
|  Do ye _ thus requite the Lord, *
|  O foolish _ people and unwise?
|
|  Is not he thy Father _ that hath bought thee? *
|  hath he not made thee and es_tablish-ed thee?
|
|  Re_member the days of old, *
|  consider the years of many _ generations.
|
|  Ask thy father and _ he will shew thee: *
|  thy elders and _ they will tell thee.
|
|  When the Most High divided to the nations _ their inheritance, *
|  when he separated the _ sons of Adam;
|
|  He set the _ bounds of the people *
|  according to the number of the _ children of Israel.
|
|  For the Lord's portion _ is his people; *
|  Jacob is the lot of _ his inheritance.
|
|  He found him in a desert land and in the waste _ howling wilderness; *
|  he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the _ apple of his eye.
|
|  As an eagle stirreth up her n¯est, +
|  fluttering _ over her young: *
|  spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth _ them on her wings:
|
|  So the Lord a_lone did lead him *
|  and there was _ no strange god with him.
|
|  He made him ride on the high _ places of the earth, *
|  that he might eat the _ increase of the fields;
|
|  And he made him to suck honey _ out of the rock, *
|  and oil _ out of the flinty rock;
|
|  Butter of kine and milk of _ sheep with fat of lambs, *
|  and rams of the breed of _ Bashan, and goats,
|
|  With the fat of _ kidneys of wheat: *
|  and thou didst drink the pure _ blood of the grape.
|
|  But Jeshurun wax-ed fat and kick-ed, _ thou art wax-en fat *
|  thou art grown thick, thou art cover_ed with fatness;
|
|  Then he forsook _ God which made him, *
|  and lightly esteem-ed the Rock of _ his salvation.
|
|  They provok-ed him to jealousy _ with strange gods, *
|  with abominations provok-ed they _ him to anger.
|
|  hey sacrific-ed unto _ devils, not to God; *
|  to gods _ whom they knew not,
|
|  To new gods _ that came newly up, *
|  whom your _ fathers fear-ed not.
|
|  Of the Rock that begat thee _ thou art unmindful, *
|  and hast forgotten _ God that form-ed thee.
|
|  And when the Lord saw it _ he abhorr-ed them, *
|  because of the provoking of his sons _ and of his daughters.
|
|  And he said I will _ hide my face from them, *
|  I will _ see what their end shall be:
|
|  For they are a very froward _ generation, *
|  children in _ whom is no faith.
|
|  They have mov-ed me to jealousy with _ that which is not God: *
|  they have provok-ed me to anger _ with their vanities.
|
|  And I will move them to jealousy with those which are _ not a people; *
|  I will provoke them to anger with a _ foolish nation.
|
|  Glory be to the _ Father and to the Son, *
|  and _ to the Holy Ghost:
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now, and _ ever shall be: *
|  _ world without end. Amen.
