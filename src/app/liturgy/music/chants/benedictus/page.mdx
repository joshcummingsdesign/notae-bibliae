## History

Also called the Song of Zechariah, the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="benedictus" text="Benedictus" /> is a Gospel [canticle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#canticle) for [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds). The words come from Luke 1:68–79, Zechariah's prayer of thanksgiving at the naming and circumcision of his son, St. John the Baptist. The Benedictus, the [Magnificat](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat) and the [Nunc dimittis](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis) form the first three canticles in the Gospel of Luke.

|  \b in domo David _ pueri sui:
|
|  And hath rais-ed up a mighty sal_vation for us, *
|  in the house of his _ servant David;
|
|  \b Sicut locutus est per _ os sanctorum, *
|  \b qui a saeculo sunt, prophe_tarum ejus:
|
|  As he spake by the mouth of his _ holy prophets, *
|  which have _ been since the world began;
|
|  \b Salutem ex ini_micis nostris, *
|  \b et de manu omnium _ qui oderunt nos:
|
|  That we should be sav-ed from _ our enemies, *
|  and from the hands of _ all that hate us.
|
|  \b Ad faciendam misericordiam cum _ patribus nostris: *
|  \b et memorari testamenti _ sui sancti.

|  that _ he would give us;
|
|  \b Ut sine timore, de manu inimicorum nostrum _ liberati, *
|  \b servi_amus illi:
|
|  That we being deliver-ed out of the hands of _ our enemies *
|  might _ serve him without fear;
|
|  \b In sanctitate et justitia _ coram ipso, *
|  \b omnibus di_ebus nostris.
|
|  In holiness and righteous_ness before him, *
|  all the _ days of our life.
|
|  \b Et tu puer, propheta Altissi_mi vocaberis: *
|  \b praeibis enim ante faciem Domini parare _ vias ejus:
|
|  And thou, child, shalt be call-ed the prophet _ of the Highest:
|  for thou shalt go before the face of the _ Lord to prepare his ways.
|
|  \b Ad dandam scientiam salutis _ plebi ejus, *
|  \b in remissionem pecca_torum eorum:
|

|
|  \b Per viscera misericordiae _ Dei nostri:
|  \b in quibus visitabit nos, ori_ens ex alto:

|  Through the tender _ mercy of our God; *
|  whereby the day-spring from on high hath _ visited us;
|
|  \b Illuminare his qui in tenebris et in umbra _ mortis sedent: *
|  \b ad dirigendos pedes nostros in _ viam pacis
|
|  To give light to them that sit in darknˇess, +
|  and in the _ shadow of death, *
|  and to guide our feet _ into the way of peace.

|  \b et Spi_ritui Sancto.
