## History

The Benedictus (also called the Song of Zechariah), is a Gospel [canticle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#canticle) from Luke 1:68–79. The Benedictus was the song of thanksgiving uttered by Zechariah on the occasion of the circumcision of his son, John the Baptist. The text forms a part of the [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds) service in the Liturgy of the Hours where it is used as a canticle. It is one of the three canticles in the first two chapters of this Gospel, the other two being the [Magnificat](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat) and the [Nunc dimittis](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis). The setting below is from the *Saint Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter* (2002), which makes use of the [Sarum Rite](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sarum-rite) tones.

**Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel,**<br/>
**quia visitavit et fecit redemptionem plebis suae**<br/>
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,<br/>
for he hath visited and redeemed his people

**et erexit cornu salutis nobis**<br/>
**in domo David pueri sui,**<br/>
and hath raised up a mighty salvation for us<br/>
in the house of his servant David,

**Sicut locutus est per os sanctorum,**<br/>
**qui a saeculo sunt, prophetarum eius,**<br/>
as he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets,<br/>
which have been since the world began,

**salutem ex inimicis nostris**<br/>
**et de manu omnium, qui oderunt nos;**<br/>
That we should be saved from our enemies<br/>
and from the hands of all that hate us;

**ad faciendam misericordiam cum patribus nostris**<br/>
**et memorari testamenti sui sancti,**<br/>
To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers<br/>
and to remember his holy covenant,

**iusiurandum, quod iuravit ad Abraham patrem nostrum,**<br/>
**daturum se nobis,**<br/>
to perform the oath which he sware to our forefather Abraham,<br/>
that he would give us,

**ut sine timore, de manu inimicorum nostrum liberati,**<br/>
**serviamus illi,**<br/>
that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies,<br/>
might serve him without fear,

**in sanctitate et iustitia coram ipso**<br/>
**omnibus diebus nostris.**<br/>
in holiness and righteousness before him<br/>
all the days of our life.

**Et tu, puer, propheta Altissimi vocaberis;**<br/>
**praeibis enim ante faciem Domini parare vias eius,**<br/>
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest;<br/>
for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,

**ad dandam scientiam salutis plebi eius**<br/>
**in remissionem peccatorum eorum,**<br/>
to give knowledge of salvation unto his people<br/>
for the remission of their sins,

**per viscera misericordiae Dei nostri,**<br/>
**in quibus visitabit nos oriens ex alto**<br/>
through the tender mercy of our God,<br/>
whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us

**illuminare his, qui in tenebris et in umbra mortis sedent,**<br/>
**ad dirigendos pedes nostros in viam pacis.**<br/>
to give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death,<br/>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
