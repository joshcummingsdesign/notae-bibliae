## History

The Benedictus (also called the Song of Zechariah), is a Gospel canticle from Luke 1:68–79. The Benedictus was the song of thanksgiving uttered by Zechariah on the occasion of the circumcision of his son, John the Baptist. The text forms a part of the [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds) service in the Liturgy of the Hours where it is used as a canticle. It is one of the three canticles in the first two chapters of this Gospel, the other two being the [Magnificat](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat) and the [Nunc Dimittis](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis). A beautiful way to chant this is with the Tonus Solemnis (Latin: "Solemn Tone") in mode VII.

**Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel,**<br/>
**quia visitavit et fecit redemptionem plebis suae**<br/>
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,<br/>
for he has visited and redeemed his people

**et erexit cornu salutis nobis**<br/>
**in domo David pueri sui,**<br/>
and has raised up a horn of salvation for us<br/>
in the house of his servant David,

**Sicut locutus est per os sanctorum,**<br/>
**qui a saeculo sunt, prophetarum eius,**<br/>
as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets,<br/>
who are from the beginning,

**salutem ex inimicis nostris**<br/>
**et de manu omnium, qui oderunt nos;**<br/>
that we should be saved from our enemies<br/>
and from the hand of all who hate us;

**ad faciendam misericordiam cum patribus nostris**<br/>
**et memorari testamenti sui sancti,**<br/>
to show the mercy promised to our fathers<br/>
and to remember his holy covenant,

**iusiurandum, quod iuravit ad Abraham patrem nostrum,**<br/>
**daturum se nobis,**<br/>
the oath that he swore to our father Abraham,<br/>
that he would grant to us,

**ut sine timore, de manu inimicorum nostrum liberati,**<br/>
**serviamus illi,**<br/>
that being delivered from the hand of our enemies,<br/>
might serve him without fear,

**in sanctitate et iustitia coram ipso**<br/>
**omnibus diebus nostris.**<br/>
in holiness and righteousness before him<br/>
all our days.<br/>

**Et tu, puer, propheta Altissimi vocaberis;**<br/>
**praeibis enim ante faciem Domini parare vias eius,**<br/>
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;<br/>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,

**ad dandam scientiam salutis plebi eius**<br/>
**in remissionem peccatorum eorum,**<br/>
to give knowledge of salvation to his people<br/>
in the forgiveness of their sins,

**per viscera misericordiae Dei nostri,**<br/>
**in quibus visitabit nos oriens ex alto**<br/>
because of the tender mercy of our God,
whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high

**illuminare his, qui in tenebris et in umbra mortis sedent,**<br/>
**ad dirigendos pedes nostros in viam pacis.**<br/>
to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,<br/>
to guide our feet into the way of peace.
