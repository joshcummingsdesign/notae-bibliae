## History

Also called the Song of Zechariah, the Benedictus is a Gospel [canticle](/glossary/liturgical-terms#canticle) for [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds). The words come from Luke 1:68–79, Zechariah's prayer of thanksgiving at the naming and circumcision of his son, St. John the Baptist. The Benedictus, the [Magnificat](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat) and the [Nunc dimittis](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis) form the first three canticles in the Gospel of Luke.

|  \b qui a saeculo sunt, prophe_tarum ejus:
|
|  As he spake by the mouth of his holy _ prophets, *
|  which have been _ since the world began;
|
|  \b Salutem ex ini_micis nostris, *
|  \b et de manu omnium _ qui oderunt nos:

|
|  \b Ut sine timore, de manu inimicorum nostrum _ liberati, *
|  \b servi_amus illi:
|
|  That we being deliver-ed out of the hands of our en_emies *

|  \b omnibus di_ebus nostris.
|
|  In holiness and righteousness be_fore him, *

|  \b praeibis enim ante faciem Domini parare _ vias ejus:
|
|  And thou, child, shalt be call-ed the prophet of the _ Highest:
|  for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord _ to prepare his ways.

|
|  To give light to them that sit in darknˇess, +

|  \b et Spi_ritui Sancto.
