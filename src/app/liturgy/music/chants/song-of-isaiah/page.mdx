<Poetry>
|  O Lord, I will praise thee though thou wast angry _ with me, *
|  thine anger is turn-ed away and thou _ comfortedst me.
|
|  Behold God is my sal_vation; *
|  I will trust and _ not be afraid:
|
|  For the Lord Jehovah is my strength and _ my song; *
|  he also is become _ my salvation.
|
|  Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of sal_vation: *
|  and in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call _ upon his Name,
|
|  Declare his doings among the _ people, *
|  make mention that his Name _ is exalted.
|
|  Sing unto the Lord for he hath done excel_lent things: *
|  this is _ known in all the earth.
|
|  Cry out and shout thou inhabitant of _ Sion: *
|  for great is the Holy One of Israel _ in the midst of thee.
|
|  Glory be to the Father and to _ the Son, *
|  and _ to the Holy Ghost:
|
|  As it was in the beginniˇng, +
|  is now, and ever _ shall be, *
|  world _ without end. Amen.
