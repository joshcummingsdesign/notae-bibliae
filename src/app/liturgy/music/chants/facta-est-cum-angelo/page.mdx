<Initial text="Facta est cum Angelo" />

## History

The words of this antiphon come from Luke 2:13-14, where the angels appear to the shepherds. It was published as early as the 16th century in the Roman Breviary. In 1934, French Benedictine monks at Solesmes Abbey (northwest France) published a chant melody for *Facta est cum Angelo* in *Antiphonale Monasticum* (Latin: "Monastic Antiphonal").
