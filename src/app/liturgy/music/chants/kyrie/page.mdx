## History

The Kyrie is an ancient liturgical chant. *"Kryie"* comes from the Greek *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="kyrie" text="Kyrie eleison" />*, which means "Lord, have mercy", a phrase that is found many times in the Bible (Ps. 6:2) (Ps. 9:13) (Ps. 31:9) (Ps. 86:3) (Ps. 123:3) (Matt. 15:22) (Matt. 17:15) (Matt. 20:30). The first certain example of its use in the Western Church's liturgy is found in the eighth book of the *Apostolic Constitutions* (4th Century).

As early as the 6th century, [Pope St. Gregory the Great](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great) noted that there were differences in the way in which Eastern and Western Churches sang the Kyrie. In the Eastern Churches, all sing it at the same time, whereas in the Western Church, the clergy sing it and the people respond. The Western Church also sings *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="christe" text="Christe eleison" />* as many times as *Kyrie eleison*.[^1]

Along with the [Gloria](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria), [Credo](/liturgy/music/chants/credo), [Sanctus](/liturgy/music/chants/sanctus), and [Agnus Dei](/liturgy/music/chants/agnus-dei), it is part of the Ordinary of the Mass.
