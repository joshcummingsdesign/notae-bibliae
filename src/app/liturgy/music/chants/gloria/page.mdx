## History

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="gloria-in-excelsis-deo" text="Gloria in excelsis Deo" />, or "Gloria" for short, is an ancient [doxology](/glossary/liturgical-terms#doxology). It is referred to as the Greater Doxology, as distinguished from the [Gloria Patri](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) or Minor Doxology. It is also called the Angelic Hymn, as the opening words come from Luke 2:14, where the angels appear to the shepherds.

Its origins trace back to as early as the 3rd century. The Latin translation is attributed to [St. Hilary](/people/saints/latin-fathers/hilary-of-poitiers) (4th century), who may have learned it while in the East,[^1] where it is used in <Definition lang="greek" anchor="orthros" text="Orthros" />, the morning office.[^2]

Along with the [Kryie](/liturgy/music/chants/kyrie), [Credo](/liturgy/music/chants/credo), [Sanctus](/liturgy/music/chants/sanctus), and [Agnus Dei](/liturgy/music/chants/agnus-dei), it is part of the Ordinary of the Mass.
