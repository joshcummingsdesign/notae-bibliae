<Initial text="Christina Rossetti" />

Christina Rossetti (1830–1894) was an English poet from London. As a young woman, she, her mother, and her sister were involved in the Anglo-Catholic movement that developed in the Church of England. Religious devotion came to play a major role in her life. She wrote many works such as Time Flies: A Reading Diary (1885) and Verses (1893), which both featured the famous poem ["Love Came Down at Christmas"](/liturgy/music/hymns/love-came-down-at-christmas).
