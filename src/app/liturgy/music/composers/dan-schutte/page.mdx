<Initial text="Dan Schutte" />

Dan Schutte (1947) is an American Catholic composer. Schutte studied theology at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley. As a Jesuit seminarian, he was one of the founding members of the St. Louis Jesuits, composers who popularized a contemporary style of church music set to sacred texts sung in English due to the liturgical reforms initiated by the Second Vatican Council. He is best known for composing the hymn ["Here I Am, Lord"](/liturgy/music/hymns/here-i-am-lord) and approximately 171 other hymns and Mass settings.
