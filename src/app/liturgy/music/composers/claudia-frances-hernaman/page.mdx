<Initial text="Claudia Frances Hernaman" />

Claudia Frances Hernaman (1838–1898) was born at Addlestone, Surrey, England. Her husband, Rev. J.W.D. Hernaman, was an Inspector of Schools. Hernaman has composed more than 150 hymns, a great proportion of which are for children, and also some translations from the Latin. Hernaman edited The Altar Hymnal (1884), an Anglo-Catholic hymnal, and contributed thereto a few translations from the Latin in addition to original hymns. She is most known for her hymn ["Lord, Who Throughout These Forty Days"](/liturgy/music/hymns/lord-who-throughout-these-forty-days).
