<Initial text="Isaac Watts" />

Isaac Watts (1674–1748) was a 17th-century English Congregational minister, hymnist, theologian, and logician. He was a prolific and popular hymn writer, and is credited with some 750 hymns including ["Joy to the World"](/liturgy/music/hymns/joy-to-the-world). He is recognized as the "Godfather of English Hymnody"; many of his hymns remain in use today and have been translated into numerous languages.
