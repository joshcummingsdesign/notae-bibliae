<Initial text="John Newton" />

In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent, unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, while his father was at sea Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother. He was also sent to boarding school, where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.

As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave. He deserted the navy to visit Mary "Polly" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he was traded as crew to a slave ship and later began a career in slave trading.

Newton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him, which became so popular that the crew began to join in. Newton gained notoriety as being one of the most profane men the captain had ever met. His disagreements with several colleagues resulted in his being starved almost to death and imprisoned while at sea. He was himself enslaved in Sierra Leone, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and crew from another ship happened to find him.

In March 1748, a violent storm came upon the Greyhound (a ship he was aboard) and it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before. After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being washed overboard, working for several hours. After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, "If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!" Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours. During his time at the wheel, he pondered his divine challenge.

Newton began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable. Not only had he neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth. He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him, though his conversion was not immediate. Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed the coasts of Africa, now as a captain, and procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, transporting them to North America. In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750.

After suffering a severe stroke in 1754, he gave up seafaring. Working as a customs agent in Liverpool starting in 1756, Newton began to teach himself Latin, Greek, and theology. He and Polly immersed themselves in the church community, and Newton's passion was so impressive that his friends suggested he become a priest in the Church of England. After being turned down, he wrote about his experiences in the slave trade and his conversion. William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, impressed with his story, sponsored Newton for ordination by John Green, Bishop of Lincoln, and he became minister of Olney (a town in Buckinghamshire, England) in 1764.

Olney was a village of about 2,500 residents whose main industry was making lace by hand. The people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor. Newton's preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit; many clergy preached from a distance, not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin. He was involved in his parishioners' lives and was much loved, although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished. His devotion and conviction, however, were apparent and forceful, and he often said his mission was to "break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart". He struck a friendship with William Cowper (popular 18th century poet and contemporary of John Newton), and in 1768, they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners.

Partly from Cowper's literary influence, and partly because educated ministers were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including [Isaac Watts](/liturgy/music/composers/isaac-watts) – whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing – and [Charles Wesley](/liturgy/music/composers/charles-wesley), with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother John, leader of the Methodist movement, had encouraged Newton to go into the clergy. Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the Psalms.

Newton and Cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting. The lyrics to ["Amazing Grace"](/liturgy/music/hymns/amazing-grace) were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on January 1, 1773. A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney was bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title *Olney Hymns*. Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in *Olney Hymns*; "1 Chronicles 17:16-17, Faith's Review and Expectation" was the title of the poem with the first line "Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)".

In 1779 Newton was invited by John Thornton to become Rector of St Mary Woolnoth, Lombard Street, London, where he officiated until his death. He contributed to the work of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, formed in 1787. During this time he wrote *Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade* in which he states; "So much light has been thrown upon the subject, by many able pens; and so many respectable persons have already engaged to use their utmost influence, for the suppression of a traffic, which contradicts the feelings of humanity; that it is hoped, this stain of our National character will soon be wiped out."

Newton died on December 21, 1807 in London.
