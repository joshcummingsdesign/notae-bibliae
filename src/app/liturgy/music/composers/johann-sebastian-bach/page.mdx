<Initial text="Johann Sebastian Bach" />

Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) was a German Lutheran composer and musician of the late Baroque period. He was a contemporary of [George Frideric Handel](/liturgy/music/composers/george-frideric-handel). His compositions include hundreds of cantatas (a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment) both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions (sacred music for Good Friday), oratorios (large-scale musical work for orchestra and voices), and motets (a polyphonic vocal composition). His compositions include the famous ["Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"](/liturgy/music/hymns/jesus-joy-of-mans-desiring).
