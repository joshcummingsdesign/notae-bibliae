<Initial text="John Mason Neale" />

Rev. Dr. John Mason Neale (1818–1866) was an English Anglican priest, scholar, and hymnist born in London, renowned for his contributions to Christian hymnody and liturgical scholarship. Educated at Sherborne School and Trinity College, Cambridge, he was deeply influenced by the Oxford Movement and co-founded the Cambridge Camden Society, advocating for Gothic Revival architecture and richer church rituals. Ordained in 1842, Neale is celebrated for translating and adapting ancient hymns from Latin, Greek, and other languages, introducing English-speaking congregations to centuries-old traditions. His work enriched hymnals like *<Definition lang="english" anchor="hymns-ancient-and-modern" text="Hymns Ancient & Modern" />* (1861) and *The English Hymnal* (1906), with his most famous hymn, ["Good King Wenceslas"](/liturgy/music/songs/good-king-wenceslas), adapted from a medieval Latin poem. An Anglo-Catholic, Neale's legacy resonates in high-church Anglicanism and Western Rite Orthodoxy, reflecting his dedication to preserving and revitalizing Christian heritage. His most famous hymn translations include ["Come, Thou Redeemer of the Earth"](/liturgy/music/hymns/come-thou-redeemer-of-the-earth), ["Again We Keep This Solemn Fast"](/liturgy/music/hymns/again-we-keep-this-solemn-fast), ["O Come, O Come, Emmanuel"](/liturgy/music/hymns/o-come-o-come-emmanuel), and ["Unto Us Is Born a Son"](/liturgy/music/hymns/unto-us-is-born-a-son).
