<Initial text="Thomas Helmore" />

Thomas Helmore (1811–1890) was an Anglican priest, choirmaster, writer, and hymnist. After studying at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, he was ordained in 1840 and served as curate and priest-vicar at St. Michael on Greenhill, Lichfield. He became Precentor at St. Mark's College, Chelsea, where he trained students in choral singing; and later, master of choristers at the Chapel Royal, St. James's.

Helmore was a leading figure in the revival of plainsong. He published influential works such as *The Psalter Noted* (1849), *The Hymnal Noted* (1852), and *Primer of Plainsong* (1877). Collaborating with [Rev. Dr. John Mason Neale](/people/divines/john-mason-neale), he adapted tunes from the 1582 Finnish song book *Piae Cantiones* (Latin: "Pious Songs")—a volume of 74 medieval songs with Latin texts collected by Jaakko Suomalainen, a Finnish Lutheran cleric, and published by T. P. Rutha, a Catholic printer—into enduring carols such as "[Good King Wenceslas](/liturgy/music/songs/good-king-wenceslas)", and worked with Neale to translate such songs as "[Unto Us Is Born a Son](/liturgy/music/hymns/unto-us-is-born-a-son)".

His interest in plainsong led him to visit the Abbey of Saint Gall in Switzerland to study ancient Gregorian chant manuscripts. Helmore's contributions to church music and plainsong had a lasting impact on Anglican and Catholic musical traditions.
