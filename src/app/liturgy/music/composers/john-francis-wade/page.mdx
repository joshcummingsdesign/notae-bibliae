<Initial text="John Francis Wade" />

John Francis Wade (1711–1786) was an English Catholic hymnist most famous for writing ["O Come, All Ye Faithful"](/liturgy/music/hymns/o-come-all-ye-faithful) (Latin: *"Adeste Fideles"*, "All Ye Faithful"). Wade fled to France after the Jacobite rising of 1745 was crushed. As a Catholic layman, he lived with exiled English Catholics in France, where he taught music and worked on church music for private use.
