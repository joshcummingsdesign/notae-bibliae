<Initial text="Joseph M. Scriven" />

Joseph M. Scriven (1819–1886) was an Irish-born Canadian poet and low-church Anglican most famous for writing ["What a Friend We Have in Jesus"](/liturgy/music/hymns/what-a-friend-we-have-in-jesus). Scriven graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 1842. His fiancée accidentally drowned in 1843, the night before they were to be married. In 1844, he moved to Canada where he served in the Plymouth Brethren, a low-church nonconformist group that originated from Anglicanism. In 1860, his second fiancée fell ill with pneumonia and died. He then devoted the rest of his life to tutoring, preaching, and helping others. Scriven tragically and unexpectedly drowned in 1886 at age 66.
