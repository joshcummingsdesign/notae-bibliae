<Initial text="James Montgomery" />

James Montgomery (1771–1854) was a Scottish poet, hymn writer, and philanthropist. Born in Irvine, Scotland, he was the son of a Moravian pastor and missionary. After losing both parents early, Montgomery was educated at the Moravian School in Fulneck, England, but left before completing his studies. He pursued various careers, including baking and storekeeping, before joining a newspaper in Sheffield (northern England).

Montgomery took over the English newspaper the *Sheffield Iris* in 1794, during a politically repressive era. He was twice imprisoned for charges of political dissent but turned his experiences into the poetry collection *Prison Amusements* (1797). Despite limited journalistic success, he gained fame as a poet. Notable works include *The Wanderer of Switzerland* (1806), *The West Indies* (1809), and *Greenland* (1819), showcasing his themes of social justice, history, and morality.

A devout Christian, Montgomery wrote over 400 hymns, many still sung today, such as ["Angels From the Realms of Glory"](/liturgy/music/hymns/angels-from-the-realms-of-glory). He collaborated on hymnals, notably revising *A Selection of Psalms and Hymns* (1820), and published *Songs of Zion* (1822). He also edited missionary journals and engaged in philanthropy and religious activism in Sheffield, where he lived from 1835 until his death in 1854. His legacy is honored through memorials, streets, and buildings bearing his name, as well as his enduring hymns.
