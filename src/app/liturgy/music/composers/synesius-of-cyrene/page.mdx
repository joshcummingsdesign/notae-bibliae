<Initial text="Synesius of Cyrene" />

Synesius (373–414 AD) was a native of Cyrene (north Africa). He became distinguished for his eloquence and philosophy, and as a statesman and patriot he took a noble stand. When the Goths were threatening his country he went to the court of Roman emperor Arcadius, and for three years tried to rouse it to the dangers that were coming on the empire. In 410 Synesius, whose Christianity had until then been by no means very pronounced, was chosen to be bishop of Ptolemais (northern Israel). Synesius had a long hesitation on personal and doctrinal grounds. Being steeped in Neoplatonism, he struggled with Christian eschatology and belief in the resurrection. He ultimately accepted the office, and was consecrated by Theophilus of Alexandria. Synesius wrote the hymn ["Lord Jesus, Think on Me"](/liturgy/music/hymns/lord-jesus-think-on-me) (Greek: *Mnóeo Christé*, Μνώεο Χριστέ), which is still sung during the season of Lent to this day.
