<Initial text="Thomas Ken" />

Thomas Ken (1637–1711) was an English Anglican priest most famous for writing ["Praise God, From Whom All Blessings Flow"](/liturgy/music/hymns/praise-god-from-whom-all-blessings-flow). Born in Hertfordshire (east England), he was orphaned as a child and raised by his sister and her husband. They enrolled him in the all-boys school at Winchester College in southern England. After his education there, he attended Hart Hall, Oxford, and New College, Oxford. Ken was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1662, serving as rector to several parishes and as a chaplain to Princess Mary of Orange, King Charles II, and the Tangier Expedition. In 1685, he was appointed Bishop of Bath and Wells. During the reign of King James II, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for refusing to sign the Declaration of Indulgence, a decree designed to promote the king's Catholic faith. Ken was acquitted of the charge. When, however, King William III ascended to the throne, Ken refused to swear loyalty to him and resigned his office, living the rest of his life at the home of his friend in Wiltshire (southwest England).
