John Henry Hopkins Jr. (1820–1891) was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the son of John Henry Hopkins, an Episcopal bishop, and served as rector of Christ Episcopal Church in Williamsport, Pennsylvania where he wrote the famous Christmas carol ["We Three Kings"](/liturgy/music/hymns/we-three-kings) in 1857. "We Three Kings" was the first widely popular Christmas carol written in America. Hopkins delivered the eulogy at the funeral of President Ulysses S. Grant in 1885.
