<Initial text="Katharina von Schlegel" />

Ka­tha­ri­na von Schle­gel (1697–1768) was a German Lutheran most famous for writing the hymn ["Be Still My Soul"](/liturgy/music/hymns/be-still-my-soul) in 1752. She lived in a Damenstift, a place where unmarried women lived together in a community setting, following a set of rules and often engaging in religious activities such as prayer and charitable works. She wrote a number of hymns in the spirit of early Pietism.
