<Initial text="George Frideric Handel" />

George Frideric Handel (1685–1759) was a Lutheran German-British Baroque composer best known for writing the music to ["Messiah"](/liturgy/music/songs/handels-messiah) (1741), an English-language oratorio (large-scale musical work for orchestra and voices). He was a contemporary of [Johann Sebastian Bach](/liturgy/music/composers/johann-sebastian-bach). His other notable works include "See, the Conquering Hero Comes!" (1747), which was written for his oratorio Joshua, and was later added to his oratorio Judas Maccabaeus (1746); and "Antioch", which was later used for [Isaac Watts'](/liturgy/music/composers/isaac-watts) hymn ["Joy to the World"](/liturgy/music/songs/joy-to-the-world).
