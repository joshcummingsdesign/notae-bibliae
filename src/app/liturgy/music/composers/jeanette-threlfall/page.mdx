<Initial text="Jeanette Threlfall" />

Jeanette Threlfall (1821–1880) was an English poet and hymnist most famous for writing ["Hosanna, Loud Hosanna"](/liturgy/music/hymns/hosanna-loud-hosanna). Born in Blackburn, Lancashire (northwest England), she was orphaned at an early age. Threlfall worked as a Sunday school teacher, had a great passion for reading and writing. In 1877, she slipped during a carriage accident, which led to a leg amputation, and a later accident left her unable to walk. She bore her sufferings well, retaining a positive attitude until her death in 1880.
