<Initial text="Joachim Neander" />

Joachim Neander (1650–1680) was a German Reformed theologian and hymnist most famous for writing "Lobe den Herren, den machtigen Konig der Ehren" (German: "Praise the Lord, the Mighty King of Honor"), which was translated into English as ["Praise to the Lord, the Almighty"](/liturgy/music/hymns/praise-to-the-lord-the-almighty). In 1679, Neander became a pastor of St Martin's church in Bremen, Germany. Neander wrote about 60 hymns and provided tunes for many of them. He is one of the first notable German hymnists after the Reformation, and is regarded as the outstanding hymnist of the German Reformed Church.
