<Initial text="Henry Francis Lyte" />

Henry Francis Lyte (1793–1847) was a Scottish Anglican divine, hymnist, and poet. Within the Anglican tradition, "divines" are clergy of the Church of England whose theological writings have been considered standards for faith, doctrine, and worship. After studying at Trinity College, Dublin, Lyte took Anglican holy orders in 1815 and for some time he held a curacy in Taghmon near Wexford, Ireland. He wrote many famous hymns including ["Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven"](/liturgy/music/hymns/praise-my-soul-the-king-of-heaven).
