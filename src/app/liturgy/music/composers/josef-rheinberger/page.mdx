<Initial text="Josef Rheinberger" />

Josef Rheinberger (1839–1901) was a German Catholic organist and composer from Liechtenstein, residing in Bavaria for most of his life. When only seven years old, he was already serving as organist at the Vaduz parish church, and his first composition was performed the following year. He is most famous for writing *["Abendlied"](/liturgy/music/hymns/abendlied)* (German: "Evensong"), a song he wrote two weeks before his 16th birthday.
