<Initial text="Horatio Spafford" />

Horatio Spafford (1828–1888) was an American Presbyterian church elder most famous for writing the hymn ["It Is Well With My Soul"](/liturgy/music/hymns/it-is-well-with-my-soul). The hymn was written following two tragic events in Spafford's life: the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which ruined him financially, and the loss of his four daughters in a shipwreck in 1873. His wife Anne survived the shipwreck, and he and Anne went on to have three more children. In 1880, their son Horatio died of scarlet fever, which prompted them to leave the Presbyterian Church and establish a religious foundation in Jerusalem called the American Colony.
