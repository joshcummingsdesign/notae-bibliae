## History

When King Edward VI ascended the throne in 1547, the Protestant reformation of the Church of England advanced rapidly under the influence of Reformers such as Thomas Cranmer. Two years later, Cranmer produced the 1549 Book of Common Prayer, which set forth the entire Latin liturgy in the English vernacular.[^1] Drawing heavily on the <Definition lang="english" anchor="sarum" text="Sarum Rite" />,[^2] it simplified the complex medieval system of seven daily <Definition lang="latin" anchor="officium" text="offices" />—designed largely for monastic communities—into two: Matins and Evensong. This reform, accompanied by a monthly psalter and a scriptural cycle of readings, aimed to make the daily worship of the Church both accessible and intelligible to the laity, thereby restoring their active participation in the Church’s continual offering of praise and prayer.[^3]
