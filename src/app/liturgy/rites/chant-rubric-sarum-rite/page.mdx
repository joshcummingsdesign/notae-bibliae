## History

---

### 3rd Century

- [St. Hippolytus](/people/saints/early/hippolytus-of-rome) attests the singing of the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hallel" text="Egyptian Hallel Psalms" /> with the Alleluia refrain.[^1]

### 4th Century

- [The Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers) introduce the practice of chanting through all 150 psalms.[^2]
- [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan) brings plainchant to the Western Church.[^3]
- The Latin translation of the [Gloria](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria)—the Angelic Hymn based on Luke 2:14—is attributed to [St. Hilary](/people/saints/latin-fathers/hilary-of-poitiers), who may have learned it while in the East,[^4] where it is used in <Definition lang="greek" anchor="orthros" text="Orthros" />, the morning office.[^5]

### 6th Century

- A system of eight chant tones called the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="octoechos" text="Octoechos" /> appears in the East.[^6]
- [Pope St. Gregory the Great](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great) organizes the corpus of plainchant for the Western Church, which comes to be known as Gregorian chant.[^7]
- The eight chant tones of Gregorian chant come to be known as the Eight Gregorian Tones.[^8]
- [*The Rule of Saint Benedict*](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) prescribes the [Domine labia mea](/liturgy/music/chants/domine-labia-mea) and the [Gloria Patri](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) for the opening rites of Matins.[^9]
- Gregorian chant makes its way to England during the Gregorian Mission.[^10]

### 8th Century

- [St. John of Damascus](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-of-damascus) is credited with further systematizing the Octoechos in the East.[^11]

### 11th Century

- The Sarum Rite, developed at Salisbury Cathedral in southern England, makes use of the Eight Gregorian Tones. The Sarum Rite is unique in that it is accepted by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion.[^12]

## The Eight Gregorian Tones

---

## Colons

Each verse in a Psalm is split up into two halves, and each half is called a "colon".

<Poetry>
|  *colon* ⇒ O Lord, open thou my lips,
|      *colon* ⇒ and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
</Poetry>

## Accents

In Gregorian chant, the first colon is split up into two halves: the "Intonation" and the "Mediation", and the second colon is referred to as the "Ending". The accent marks above the staff tell you how to match the syllables with the tone.

**Example: Tone II — Mediation with One Accent**

**Example: Tone III — Mediation with Two Accents**

  alt="Example: Tone II* — Mediation with Two Accents"
  width="600"
  height="203"
/>

As a general rule of thumb, **accent marks always fall on a colon's penultimate or antepenultimate syllable.**

## Intonation

- The Intonation is only used in the first verse and is not repeated, except for in the Gospel canticles where it begins each verse.
- If a verse doesn't have enough syllables for both the Intonation and the Mediation, one of the following should be done:
  - Abbreviate the Intonation
  - Abbreviate the Intonation and the Mediation
  - Omit the Mediation

## Mediation

- Accent marks should fall on a colon's penultimate syllable.
  - In *God* my S**á**-vior
  - *God* shall bl**é**ss us
  - *Thine* in-dig-n**á**-tion

- If that doesn't make sense, use the antepenultimate syllable.
  - Be-*cause* of thine **é**-ne-mies
  - In-*creas*-ed that tr**ó**u-ble me
  - The *beau*-ty of h**ó**-li-ness

- If neither option makes sense, use the abrupt form of the Mediation, i.e. end on the accent.
  - His *tem*-ple on h**í**gh
  - That *say* of my s**ó**ul
  - And *house* of de-f**é**nse

- Apply this rule down the line with Mediations that have two accents.
  - In the d**á**y of tr**ó**u-ble
  - Re-*mem*-ber **á**ll thy **ó**f-fer-ings
  - Gr**á**nt we thy h**é**art's de-*sire*
  - In the n**á**me of the L**ó**rd our *God*

## Ending

- The Ending has no abrupt form, and uses only one accent mark. Thus, the accent mark always falls on a colon's penultimate or antepenultimate syllable.
  - And *to* the H**ó**-ly Ghost
  - In the *way* of g**ó**d-li-ness
  - *Through* the **é**ast wind[^13]

## Pointing

Psalters will often have marks to indicate when to leave the reciting note and enter the Mediation or the Ending. This is called "pointing". Here are some common symbols used for pointing along with their meanings:

The Dot **<Red text="·"/>** indicates when to leave the reciting note and enter the Mediation or the Ending.

The Asterisk **<Red text="*"/>** indicates the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="caesura" text="caesura" />* (the end of a colon).

The Flex **<Red text="†" />** indicates a short pause for a breath. The syllable before the Flex is either inflected (dropping in pitch) or uninflected (staying on the reciting note). After the Flex, you stay on the reciting note.

The [ **<Red text="ˇ" />** ] mark indicates that the syllable before the Flex is inflected.

The [ **<Red text="¯" />** ] mark indicates that the syllable before the Flex is uninflected.[^14]
