<Initial text="Chant Rubric: Sarum Rite" />

<Definition lang="english" anchor="sarum" text="The Sarum Rite" />, was the local form of the Latin liturgy used at Salisbury Cathedral in southern England from the 11th century until the English Reformation. The following is the chant rubric for the Sarum Rite, which gives us a clear understanding of how the chant tones can be applied to the psalms and canticles.

## The Eight Gregorian Tones

---

## Colons

Each verse in a psalm is split up into two halves, and each half is called a "colon".

<Poetry>
|  *colon* ⇒ O Lord, open thou my lips,
|      *colon* ⇒ and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
</Poetry>

## Accents

In Gregorian chant, the first colon is split up into two halves: the "Intonation" and the "Mediation", and the second colon is referred to as the "Ending". The accent marks above the staff tell you how to match the syllables with the tone.

**Example: Tone II — Mediation with One Accent**

**Example: Tone III — Mediation with Two Accents**

  width="600"
  height="203"
/>

As a general rule of thumb, **accent marks always fall on a colon's penultimate or antepenultimate syllable.**

## Intonation

- The Intonation is only used in the first verse and is not repeated, except for in the Gospel canticles where it begins each verse.
- If a verse doesn't have enough syllables for both the Intonation and the Mediation, one of the following should be done:
  - Abbreviate the Intonation
  - Abbreviate the Intonation and the Mediation
  - Omit the Mediation

## Mediation

- Accent marks should fall on a colon's penultimate syllable.
  - In *God* my S**á**-vior
  - *God* shall bl**é**ss us
  - *Thine* in-dig-n**á**-tion

- If that doesn't make sense, use the antepenultimate syllable.
  - Be-*cause* of thine **é**-ne-mies
  - In-*creas*-ed that tr**ó**u-ble me
  - The *beau*-ty of h**ó**-li-ness

- If neither option makes sense, use the abrupt form of the Mediation, i.e. end on the accent.
  - His *tem*-ple on h**í**gh
  - That *say* of my s**ó**ul
  - And *house* of de-f**é**nse

- Apply this rule down the line with Mediations that have two accents.
  - In the d**á**y of tr**ó**u-ble
  - Re-*mem*-ber **á**ll thy **ó**f-fer-ings
  - Gr**á**nt we thy h**é**art's de-*sire*
  - In the n**á**me of the L**ó**rd our *God*

## Ending

- The Ending has no abrupt form, and uses only one accent mark. Thus, the accent mark always falls on a colon's penultimate or antepenultimate syllable.
  - And *to* the H**ó**-ly Ghost
  - In the *way* of g**ó**d-li-ness
  - *Through* the **é**ast wind[^1]

## Pointing

Psalters will often have marks to indicate when to leave the reciting note and enter the Mediation or the Ending. This is called "pointing". Here are some common symbols used for pointing along with their meanings:

The Dot **<Red text="·"/>** indicates when to leave the reciting note and enter the Mediation or the Ending.

The Asterisk **<Red text="*"/>** indicates the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="caesura" text="caesura" />* (the end of a colon).

The Flex **<Red text="†" />** indicates a short pause for a breath. The syllable before the Flex is either inflected (dropping in pitch) or uninflected (staying on the reciting note). After the Flex, you stay on the reciting note.

The [ **<Red text="ˇ" />** ] mark indicates that the syllable before the Flex is inflected.

The [ **<Red text="¯" />** ] mark indicates that the syllable before the Flex is uninflected.[^2]

## Chanting the Collect

---

There are two melodic cadences for the [Collect](/glossary/liturgical-terms#collect): the **<Definition lang="latin" anchor="metrum" text="Metrum" />** and the **Flex**.

**The Metrum**

/>

**The Flex**

  src="/chants/collect-flex.svg"
  alt="Collect Flex"
  width="600"
  height="60"
/>

The Collect has three parts the **address** ("Almighty God..."), the **petition** ("Grant us that..."), the **oblation** ("So that we may..."), and the **doxology** ("Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.").

The **Metrum** is applied to the **end of the address** and the **doxology**, and the **Flex** is applied to the **end of the petition** and the **oblation**. In other words, you open and close with the Metrum, and the Flex goes in the middle.

**Example: Collect for Peace at Matins**
