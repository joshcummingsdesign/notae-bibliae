|  On the day he was to suffer,
|      he took bread
|          in his holy and venerable hands,
|      and with eyes raised to heaven to you, O God,
|          his almighty Father,
|          giving you thanks he said the blessing,
|      broke the bread
|      and gave it to his disciples, saying:
|  Take this all of you and eat of it,
|      for this is my body.[^8][^9]
|
|  In a similar way,
|      when supper was ended,
|      he took this precious chalice
|          in his holy and venerable hands,
|          and once more giving you thanks,
|      he said the blessing
|      and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
|  Take this, all of you, and drink from it,
|      for this is the chalice of my blood,
|          the blood of the new covenant,
|          the mystery of faith,
|      which will be poured out for you and for many
|      for the forgiveness of sins.[^10][^11]
