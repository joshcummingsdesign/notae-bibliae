<Initial text="Liturgy of the Hours: Sarum Rite" />

The Sarum Rite, developed in the 11th century at Salisbury Cathedral in southern England, is unique in that it is accepted by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion. Some of the history of the Rite is outlined in the *<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter" />* (2002).[^1] Much like the Benedictine Rite, the Sarum Rite uses a seven-day psalter, meaning that by the end of the week, one will have chanted through all 150 psalms.
