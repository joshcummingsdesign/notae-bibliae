<Initial text="Liturgy of the Hours: Sarum Rite" />

The Sarum Rite, developed in the 11th century at Salisbury Cathedral in southern England, is unique in that it is accepted by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion. Some of the history of the Rite is outlined in the *<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter" />* (2002),[^1] which is helpful for praying through the Divine Office. The *Saint Dunstan's Psalter* is a 30-day psalter, meaning that by the end of the month, one will have gone through all 150 psalms.
