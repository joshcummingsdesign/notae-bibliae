<Initial text="Sarum Rite" />

<Definition lang="english" anchor="sarum" text="The Sarum Rite" />, or <Definition lang="latin" anchor="usus" text="Use of Sarum" />, was the local form of the Latin liturgy used at Salisbury Cathedral in southern England from the 11th century until the English Reformation. Though largely conforming to the [Roman Rite](/liturgy/rites/roman-rite), it incorporated distinctive English elements of ceremony, chant, and calendar. The Sarum Rite is significant because it provides a clear window into the liturgical practices of the English Church before the Reformation.[^1]
