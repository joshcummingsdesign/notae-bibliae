<Initial text="Liturgy of the Hours: Benedictine" />

In the 6th century, [St. Benedict](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) composed his *Rule of Saint Benedict* for monks living in community under the authority of an abbot. In it, he prescribed a seven-day psalter, so that by the end of each week all 150 psalms would have been chanted—a task, he notes, that his predecessors had accomplished within a single day.[^1] Although his *Rule* sets forth an order for the weekly psalms, St. Benedict allowed for adjustments to the sequence, provided that the entire psalter was completed each week.[^2]
