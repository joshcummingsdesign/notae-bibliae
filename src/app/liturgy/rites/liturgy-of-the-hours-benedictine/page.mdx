<Initial text="Liturgy of the Hours: Benedictine" />

[*The Rule of Saint Benedict*](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) defines a seven-day psalter, meaning that by the end of the week, one would have gone through all 150 psalms; a task that St. Benedict points out had been accomplished by his predecessors in just one day. While St. Benedict outlines the order of the psalter, he emphasizes that completing the seven-day cycle is more important than strictly following his order.[^1]
