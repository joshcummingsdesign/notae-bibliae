## Introductory Rites
---

## Opening Sentence

*❡ The Officiant reads an Opening Sentence proper to the day, for example:*

<Poetry>
|  The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
|      a broken and contrite heart, O God,
|          thou wilt not despise.[^1][^2]
</Poetry>

## Exhortation

*❡ Then the Officiant shall read the Exhortation.*

Dearly beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us, in sundry places, to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness and mercy. And although we ought, at times, humbly to acknowledge our sins before God; yet ought we chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet together to render thanks for the great benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, to hear his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are requisite and necessary, as well as for the body as for the soul. Wherefore I pray and beseech you, as many as are here present, to accompany me with a pure heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace, saying—[^3]

## General Confession

*❡ To be said by the Officiant bowing and congregation kneeling (a layman Officiant kneels).*

Almighty and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; And we have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind In Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.[^4]

## Absolution

*❡ Here follows the Absolution, pronounced by the Priest alone, in the normal reading voice, standing; the people still kneeling.*

Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and live, hath given power, and commandment, to his Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent, the Absolution and Remission of all their sins. He pardoneth and absolveth <Red text="✠" /> all those who truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel. Wherefore, let us beseech him to grant us true repentance, and his Holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we do at this present; and that the rest of our life hereafter may be pure and holy; so that at the last we may come to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen*.[^5]

## Closing Prayers

*❡ Then the Officiant shall read the following prayers.*

**Prayer for Civil Authorities**

O Lord, our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings, Lord of lords, the only Ruler of princes, who dost from thy throne behold all the dwellers upon earth; Most heartily we beseech thee, with thy favor to behold our civil authorities; and so replenish them with the grace of thy Holy Spirit, that they may alway incline to thy will, and walk in thy way. Endue them plenteously with heavenly gifts; grant them in health and wealth long to live; strengthen them that they may vanquish and overcome all their enemies, and finally, after this life they may attain everlasting joy and felicity; through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen*.[^12]

**Prayer for the Clergy and People**

Almighty and everlasting God, who alone workest great marvels; Send down upon our Bishops and Curates, and all Congregations committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace; and that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy blessing. Grant this, O Lord, for the honour of our Advocate and Mediator, Jesus Christ. *Amen*.[^13]

**A Prayer of Saint John Chrysostom**

Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplications unto thee; and dost promise that when two or three are gathered together in thy Name thou wilt grant their requests; Fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and petitions of thy servants, as may be most expedient for them; granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come life everlasting. *Amen*.[^14]
