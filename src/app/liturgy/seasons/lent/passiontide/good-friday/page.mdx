Friday of Holy Week

## Significance

Good Friday commemorates the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="passio" text="Passion" /> of Jesus Christ. The word "good" in this sense means "holy". The fast from Good Friday until Easter Vigil is called the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="paschalis" text="Paschal Fast" />. This fast is to honor Jesus' suffering and death, and to prepare to share more fully and to celebrate more readily his resurrection. From noon to 3pm, The Three Hours' Agony is observed to commemorate Christ's three hours of suffering on the cross. At that time, The Seven Last Words from the Cross are read.

On Friday, likely midnight after the Passover, the day of preparation before the Sabbath during the week of the Passover, Jesus is brought before Annas, the former high priest, and Caiaphas, the high priest. Peter denies Jesus as foretold and weeps bitterly. Jesus is brought before the counsel. Judas hangs himself. Jesus is taken before Pontius Pilate and Herod Antipas. The crowd chooses Barabbas to be released instead of Jesus. Jesus is scourged, given a crown of thorns, and delivered to be crucified. At noon, they arrive at <Definition lang="latin" anchor="calvaria" text="Calvary" /> where he is crucified. Darkness falls until 3pm, and Jesus speaks the Seven Last Words from the Cross. His side is pierced and he is buried in a nearby garden.
