Ash Wednesday – Eastertide

## Significance

<Definition lang="english" anchor="lenten" text="Lent" /> is the season encompassing the 40 days between Ash Wednesday and [Eastertide](/liturgy/seasons/eastertide) (not including Sundays, as fasting is traditionally not practiced on Sundays). The Fifth Sunday of Lent marks the beginning of [Passiontide](/liturgy/seasons/lent/passiontide).

During Lent, fasting (not eating or eating only one meal) and abstinence (not eating meat) are practiced in honor of Jesus' 40 days in the wilderness. Fasting is practiced on Ash Wednesday and from Good Friday to Easter Vigil (the evening before Easter Sunday), and abstinence is practiced every Friday during Lent. Fasting is traditionally not done on Sundays. It is customary to do penance (give alms and/or give up something of importance) during this time. The fast from Good Friday until Easter Vigil is called the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="paschalis" text="Paschal Fast" />. This fast is to honor Jesus' suffering and death, and to prepare to share more fully and to celebrate more readily his resurrection.
