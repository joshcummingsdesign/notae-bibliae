<Initial text="Lent" />

<Definition lang="english" anchor="lenten" text="Lent" /> is the season encompassing the 40 days between Ash Wednesday and [Eastertide](/liturgy/seasons/eastertide) (not including Sundays, as fasting is traditionally not practiced on Sundays). The Fifth Sunday of Lent marks the beginning of [Passiontide](/liturgy/seasons/passiontide).

## Shrove Tuesday

The day before Ash Wednesday is called <Definition lang="english" anchor="shrove" text="Shrove Tuesday" />. Shrove Tuesday is about self-examination, repentance, and reflection on what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth we especially need to ask God's help in dealing with. On this day the palms distributed during the previous year's [Palm Sunday](/liturgy/seasons/passiontide/palm-sunday) liturgies are burned to make the ashes for Ash Wednesday.

## Ash Wednesday

Ash Wednesday is the Wednesday 46 days before Easter Sunday (40 days plus the six Sundays leading up to [Easter](/liturgy/seasons/eastertide/easter), which are traditionally not fast days). It is a day of fasting and penance, and begins the season of Lent. Ashes have a long biblical history of signifying repentance (Dan. 9:3). Traditionally, on Ash Wednesday, one receives the sign of the cross in ashes on one's forehead. This is an outward sign of the inward faith and repentance to which Jesus called us (Mark 1:14-15).

## Fasting

During Lent, fasting (not eating or eating only one meal) and abstinence (not eating meat) are practiced in honor of Jesus' 40 days in the wilderness. Fasting is practiced on Ash Wednesday and from Good Friday to Easter Vigil (the evening before Easter Sunday), and abstinence is practiced every Friday during Lent. Fasting is traditionally not done on Sundays. It is customary to do penance (give alms and/or give up something of importance) during this time. The fast from Good Friday until Easter Vigil is called the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="paschalis" text="Paschal Fast" />. This fast is to honor Jesus' suffering and death, and to prepare to share more fully and to celebrate more readily his resurrection.

## Laetare Sunday

<Definition lang="latin" anchor="laetare" text="Laetare" /> Sunday occurs on the fourth Sunday during Lent, and is a day of celebration within the austere period of Lent.
