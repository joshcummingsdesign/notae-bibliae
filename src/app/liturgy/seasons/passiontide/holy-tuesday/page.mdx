Tuesday of Holy Week

## Significance

On Tuesday, two days before the Passover, the disciples see the cursed fig tree, and from it Jesus teaches them a lesson in faith. Then Jesus enters the temple and begins teaching. Although his authority is challenged by the chief priests and the elders, he speaks about the kingdom, resurrection, and the Great Command, and pronounces seven woes to the scribes and Pharisees. Jesus and the disciples then go to the Mount of Olives opposite the temple and he foretells the destruction of the temple, his second coming, and the final judgment. Jesus then foretells his crucifixion, and the chief priests and the elders gather in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas, and plot to kill him.
