Sunday of Holy Week

## Significance

On Sunday, four days before Passover, Jesus enters Jerusalem riding on a donkey (Zech. 9:9) while people in the crowd spread their cloaks and the branches of palm trees on the road. Palm branches represent praise and rejoicing in Israel (Lev. 23:40), as well as triumph in Roman culture. The people shout, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” and “Hosanna in the highest!”. The word “hosanna” means “O save!”, and it comes from the Hebrew *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hoshia-na" text="hoshia na" />* (Ps. 118:25-26). It was used to address kings.
