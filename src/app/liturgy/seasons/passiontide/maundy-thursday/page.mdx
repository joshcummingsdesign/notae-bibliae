Thursday of Holy Week

## Significance

The word "maundy" refers to the washing of the saints' feet, and comes from the word *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="mandatum" text="mandatum" />*, which is the first word in the Latin verse sung during the rite of footwashing on this day: "A new *mandatum* (commandment) I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another" (John 13:34).

On Thursday, the day of the Passover, Jesus has the Last Supper with the apostles in Jerusalem. He washes their feet to signify that disciples are to serve each other as Christ served them. He inaugurates the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="eukharistia" text="Eucharist" />, signifying that his body and blood are given for the forgiveness of sins. He foretells his betrayal (2 Sam. 16:21) (Ps. 41:9). He gives a new commandment to love one another. He promises the Holy Spirit, and prays the High Priestly Prayer. He then goes to pray in Gethsemane where he is betrayed by Judas. Jesus is seized by a large crowd of soldiers and officers of the chief priests and the Pharisees carrying lanterns, torches, swords, and clubs, and the disciples flee.
