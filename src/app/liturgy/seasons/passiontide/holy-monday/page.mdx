Monday of Holy Week

## Significance

On Monday, three days before the Passover, Jesus and His disciples head back to Jerusalem. On the way, Jesus sees a fig tree with no fruit and curses it. The implication perhaps being that Israel is the fig tree that never bore fruit (Mic. 7:1) (Jer. 8:13) (Luke 13:6-9). Then Jesus enters the temple and drives out the money-changers.

## Readings

- Jesus Curses the Fig Tree (Matt. 21:18-19) (Mark 11:12-14)
