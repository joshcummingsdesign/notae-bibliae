Saturday of Holy Week

## Significance

On Saturday, the Sabbath after Jesus' crucifixion, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and asked that soldiers guard Jesus's tomb so that none of the disciples would steal his body to falsely claim that he had risen on the third day as he had prophesied. Pilate sent soldiers to seal the tomb and guard it.

## Readings

- The Guard at the Tomb (Matt. 27:62-66)
