November 2

## Significance

All Souls' Day is a day of prayer and remembrance for the faithful departed. Praying for the dead is an ancient practice evident in early catacomb inscriptions, liturgies, and the writings of Church Fathers such as [Tertullian](/people/scholars/tertullian) and [St. Cyprian](/people/saints/latin-fathers/cyprian-of-carthage). By the 6th century, [Benedictine](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) monasteries held commemorations for their deceased members at Whitsuntide, and in the time of [St. Isidore of Seville](/people/saints/latin-fathers/isidore-of-seville), communities in what is now Spain observed the Monday after Pentecost for the same purpose. The definitive form of All Souls' Day on November 2 emerged in the 11th century when the Benedictine abbot St. Odilo of Cluny instituted an annual commemoration of all the faithful departed, linking prayer with almsgiving and fasting. The practice spread from Cluniac monasteries throughout the Western Church and was adopted in Rome by the 13th century.
