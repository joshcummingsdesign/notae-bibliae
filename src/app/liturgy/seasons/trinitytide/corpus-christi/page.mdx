Thursday After Trinity Sunday

## Significance

<Definition lang="latin" anchor="corpus-christi" text="Corpus Christi" /> celebrates the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist and the centrality of the Lord's Supper in the life of the Church. The feast focuses on thanksgiving for Christ's self-giving in the bread and wine and invites the faithful to reflect on the spiritual nourishment and unity found in the Sacrament. The feast of Corpus Christi was proposed by [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas) in order to create a feast focused solely on the Holy Eucharist, and it was added to the calendar in 1264 by Pope Urban IV.
