<Initial text="Ordinary Time" />

<Definition lang="latin" anchor="ordinarius" text="Ordinary Time" /> is a period in the liturgical year that falls outside of the major seasons of [Advent](/liturgy/seasons/advent) and [Lent](/liturgy/seasons/lent). It is divided into two parts: the first falls between [Epiphanytide](/liturgy/seasons/epiphanytide) and Lent, and the second falls between [Eastertide](/liturgy/seasons/eastertide) and Advent. During Ordinary Time, the readings and prayers focus on the teachings of Jesus, his ministry, and the Church's mission in the world. It's a time for believers to reflect on their everyday lives and how they can live out their faith in a more profound way. The word "ordinary" in this sense means "ordering our lives".
