First Sunday after Pentecost

## Significance

Trinity Sunday is celebrated on the first Sunday after Pentecost, and commemorates the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, the three Persons of God: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In the early church, no special <Definition lang="latin" anchor="officium" text="office" /> was assigned for the Holy Trinity. When the Arian heresy was spreading, the Fathers prepared an office with canticles, responses, a preface, and hymns, to be recited on Sundays. In the *Gregorian Sacramentary* (10th century) there are prayers and the Preface of the Trinity. During the Middle Ages, especially during the Carolingian period, devotion to the Blessed Trinity was a highly important feature of private devotion and inspired several liturgical expressions. Sundays are traditionally dedicated to the Holy Trinity.

Pope Alexander II (1061–1073), refused a petition for a special feast on the grounds that such a feast was not customary in the Western Church which daily honored the Holy Trinity by such forms of liturgy as the [Gloria Patri](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri), but he did not forbid the celebration where it already existed. A new office had been made by the Franciscan friar John Peckham (1279 – 1292), who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Pope John XXII (1316–1334) ordered the feast for the entire church on the first Sunday after Pentecost. It was raised to the dignity of a solemnity (a feast of the highest rank) in 1911 by Pope Pius X. Since it was after the first great Pentecost that the doctrine of the Trinity was proclaimed to the world, the feast becomingly follows that of Pentecost.
