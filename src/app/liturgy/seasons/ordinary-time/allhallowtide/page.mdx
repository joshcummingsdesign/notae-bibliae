October 31 – November 2

## Significance

All Saints’ Day, also known as All Hallows’ Day, is a Christian solemnity (a feast of the highest rank) celebrated in honor of all the saints of the Church, whether they are known or unknown. From the 4th century, feasts commemorating all Christian martyrs were held in various places, on various dates near Easter and Pentecost. In the 9th century, some churches in the British Isles began holding the commemoration of all saints on November 1, and in the 9th century this was extended to the whole Catholic Church by Pope Gregory IV.

In the Western Church, the liturgical celebration of All Saints’ Day begins with its first [Vespers](/liturgy/rites/liturgy-of-the-hours-benedictine-rite#vespers) on the evening of October 31, All Hallows’ Eve (or “Halloween”), and ends at the [Compline](/liturgy/rites/liturgy-of-the-hours-benedictine-rite#compline) of November 1. It is thus the day before All Souls’ Day, which commemorates the faithful departed. The three-day period from All Hallows’ Eve to All Souls’ Day is referred to as Allhallowtide.
