## Significance

<Definition lang="latin" anchor="sepulcrum" text="The Church of the Holy Sepulchre" /> is a 4th-century church commissioned by Emperor Constantine in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. Tradition holds that this is the location where Jesus was crucified, buried, and rose from the dead, and where the True Cross is said to have been found by Helena, Constantine's mother. The church was consecrated on September 13, 335, and on September 14th, the True Cross was brought outside the church so that the clergy and faithful could pray before it. Unlike Good Friday, which is dedicated to the passion of Christ and the crucifixion, the Feast of the Cross celebrates the cross itself, as the sign of salvation.
