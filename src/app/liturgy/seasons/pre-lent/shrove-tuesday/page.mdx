Day Before Ash Wednesday

## Significance

The day before [Ash Wednesday](/liturgy/seasons/lent/ash-wedensday) is called <Definition lang="english" anchor="shrove" text="Shrove Tuesday" />. Shrove Tuesday is about self-examination, repentance, and reflection on what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth we especially need to ask God's help in dealing with. On this day the palms distributed during the previous year's [Palm Sunday](/liturgy/seasons/lent/palm-sunday) liturgies are burned to make the ashes for Ash Wednesday.
