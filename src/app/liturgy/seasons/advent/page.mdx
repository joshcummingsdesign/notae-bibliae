<Initial text="Advent" />

Beginning the liturgical year, <Definition lang="latin" anchor="adventus" text="Advent" /> is the season encompassing the four Sundays leading up to [Christmastide](/liturgy/seasons/christmastide). Advent is about preparing our hearts and our minds for the coming of Christ.

## Dates

The Nativity Fast was originally 40 days to represent Jesus' 40 days in the wilderness, but it was later shortened to four weeks. Thus, Advent begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas.

## Gaudete Sunday

<Definition lang="latin" anchor="gaudete" text="Gaudete Sunday" /> is the third Sunday of Advent, and is a pause in the penitential spirit of Advent. As the name implies, Gaudete Sunday deals with rejoicing in the Lord as well as remembering the mission of [St. John the Baptist](/people/saints/biblical/john-the-baptist) and his connection with Advent.

## Advent Wreath

The concept of the Advent wreath originated among German Lutherans in the 16th century. The custom gained ground among Protestant churches in Germany, and Roman Catholics in Germany began to adopt the custom in the 1920s. In the 1930s it spread to North America.

Advent wreaths are circular, representing God's infinite love, and are usually made of evergreen leaves, which represent the hope of eternal life brought by Jesus Christ. Within the Advent wreath are four candles that represent the four weeks of the Advent season as well as the light of God coming into the world through the birth of Jesus Christ. The four candles of the Advent wreath also symbolize hope, peace, joy and love, with these candles being lit subsequently throughout each week of the Advent season. There are three violet candles (representing prayer, penance, and sacrifice) and one rose candle (representing joy). The rose candle is lit on Gaudete Sunday. Many Advent wreaths also have a white candle in the center known as the Christ Candle, which is lit on Christmas Eve.

## O Antiphons

The final days of Advent, from December 17 to December 24, are about preparing for the celebrations of the Nativity. The [O Antiphons](/glossary/liturgical-terms#o-antiphons) are sung at [Vespers](/liturgy/rites/liturgy-of-the-hours-benedictine-rite#vespers) during this time.
