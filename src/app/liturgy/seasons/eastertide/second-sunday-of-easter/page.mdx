## Significance

Thomas, doubting and perhaps believing they had seen a spirit, says that unless he touches Jesus’ hands and feels the mark of the nails, he will never believe. Eight days later, the Sunday after Jesus’ resurrection (using inclusive counting), the eleven disciples are gathered with the doors locked. Jesus miraculously opens the doors and stands among them. Thomas believes. Jesus is then with the disciples for 40 days before he ascends into heaven (Acts 1:3).
