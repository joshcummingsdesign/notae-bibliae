Sunday on or after the [Paschal full moon](/meditations/the-lords-day#paschal-full-moon)

## Significance

On Sunday, the third day after Jesus' crucifixion, the day of the Feast of the Firstfruits, early in the morning while it is still dark, Mary Magdalene goes back to the tomb. When she arrives, she sees the stone rolled back from the tomb and the guards on the ground trembling with fear. She runs to tell Peter and John, who see the empty tomb and Jesus' folded grave clothes. Jesus then appears to Mary Magdalene and the disciples.
