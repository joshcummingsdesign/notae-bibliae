40 days after Easter

## Significance

The Feast of the Ascension commemorates the bodily ascension of Jesus into heaven. It is celebrated 40 days after Easter because after Jesus’ resurrection he was on the earth for 40 days before his ascension (Acts 1:3).

## Readings

The apostles are called in the Spirit to go to the mountain in Galilee. When they arrive, they see Jesus and fall down and worship. Jesus says, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matt. 28:18-20). Jesus is with the disciples for 40 days and speaks to them about the kingdom of God (Acts 1:3). Jesus leads the apostles to Bethany. When they arrive, he orders them to wait in Jerusalem for the promise of the Father, the Holy Spirit, and then tells them they will be his witnesses in Jerusalem, all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. Then, Jesus blesses them, and is taken up to heaven in a cloud (cf. the word “cloud” in Ex. 13:21). The disciples worship him, and then return to Jerusalem with great joy. They worship continually in the temple blessing God.
