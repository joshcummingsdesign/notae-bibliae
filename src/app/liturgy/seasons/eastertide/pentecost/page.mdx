50 days after Easter

## Significance

Pentecost commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks. It is celebrated 50 days (inclusive counting) after Easter Sunday. It is also one of the primary days the sacrament of Baptism is celebrated.

The Feast of Weeks (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shavuot" text="Shavuot" />*) was the second of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals commanded by God in the Old Testament. It is also called the Feast of the Harvest.

The day after the Sabbath following Passover (Easter Sunday), one was to take an <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="omer" text="omer" /> of the firstfruits of the harvest to the priest to be waved before the Lord as a wave offering. After omer the was offered at the Feast of Firstfruits, one was to count aloud every day for 50 days (7 weeks or “week of weeks”, inclusive counting) leading up to the Feast of the Harvest. This is called the Counting of the Omer. Thus, the Feast of the Harvest is also called the Feast of Weeks or <Definition lang="greek" anchor="pentekoste" text="Pentecost" />. Petnecost was the concluding festival of the grain harvest, and was a feast giving thanks to the Lord for his abundant provision. The Lord appeared to Israel at Mount Sinai 7 weeks (3rd new moon) after the Exodus, descending in fire on the third day in the sight of all the people to give them the Law, thus Pentecost also commemorated the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai.

After Jesus appeared to the disciples following his resurrection, he told them to wait in the city until they were clothed with power from on high. Jews from all over were gathered together for the feast of Pentecost, and the disciples were there together in one place. The Holy Spirit then descended on them as divided tongues as of fire, and rested on them. They then began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. This then miraculously allowed them to share the gospel with the Jewish diaspora. Peter then delivered a sermon that led to the baptism of about 3,000 people. The believers then began devoting themselves to prayer, fellowship, the sharing of goods, and the giving of alms, and the number of believers began to grow.
