<Initial text="Annunciation" />

March 25 or the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter

## Significance

The Feast of the Annunciation commemorates the visit of the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary, during which he informed her that she would be the mother of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

Tradition holds that Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit on March 25th, which coincides with the day he was crucified ([Augustine, On the Trinity, Book IV, par. 9](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130104.htm)). Thus, the Annunciation is celebrated on March 25th, and Christmas is celebrated on December 25th.

Interestingly, if Zechariah entered the temple to burn incense on Yom Kippur in September (Luke 1:8-9), and Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit six months later on Passover in March (Luke 1:26-27), nine months after that would be December.

If the Feast of the Annunciation falls during Holy Week, it is celebrated the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.

## Readings

Six months after the conception of John the Baptist, the angel Gabriel (Hebrew: "God is my strength") (Dan. 8:16-17) is sent by God to Mary in Nazareth. Gabriel says to her, "Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women" (Luke 1:28). She is greatly troubled, but Gabriel says to her, "Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end" (Luke 1:30-33). Mary wonders how this will happen since she is a virgin, and Gabriel responds, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible" (Luke 1:35-37). Mary responds, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word" (Luke 1:38).
