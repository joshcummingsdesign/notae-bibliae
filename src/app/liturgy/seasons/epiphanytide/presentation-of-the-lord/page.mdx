## Significance

Mary fulfilled the rite of purification according to the Law (Lev. 12:2-8). After the 40 days, Mary and Joseph bring Jesus to the temple in Jerusalem and offer a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons (Luke 2:22-24). The Holy Spirit sends a man named Simeon into the temple who blesses the Lord for sending a light of revelation to the Gentiles and glory to Israel (Luke 2:25-26). He warns Mary that the child is appointed for the rise and fall of many (Luke 2:34-35). The Holy Spirit sends a widow named Anna who is a prophetess who sees Jesus and begins to tell the people of the coming redemption (Luke 2:36-38).
