First Sunday after Epiphany

## Significance

The Baptism of the Lord commemorates the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. It is celebrated on the first Sunday after Epiphany.

## Readings

Jesus comes to John at the Jordan River to be baptized. John says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29) (Isa. 53:7). John argues that Jesus should be the one baptizing him, but Jesus insists in order to "fulfill all righteousness" (Matt. 3:15). After Jesus's baptism, the heavens open, the Holy Spirit descends like a dove and rests on Jesus, and a voice comes from heaven saying, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased" (Mark 1:11) (Isa. 42:1). God tells John the Baptist that Jesus is the one who "baptizes with the Holy Spirit" (John 1:33).
