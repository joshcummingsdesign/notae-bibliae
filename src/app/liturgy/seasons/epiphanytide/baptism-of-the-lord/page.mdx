First Sunday of Epiphany

## Significance

The Baptism of the Lord commemorates the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. It is celebrated on the First Sunday After Epiphany.

Jesus comes to John at the Jordan River to be baptized. John says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29) (Isa. 53:7). John argues that Jesus should be the one baptizing him, but Jesus insists in order to "fulfill all righteousness" (Matt. 3:15). After Jesus's baptism, the heavens open, the Holy Spirit descends like a dove and rests on Jesus, and a voice comes from heaven saying, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased" (Mark 1:11) (Isa. 42:1). God tells John the Baptist that Jesus is the one who "baptizes with the Holy Spirit" (John 1:33).
