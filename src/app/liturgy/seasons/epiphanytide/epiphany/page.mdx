## Readings

Wise men from the east, likely pagan seers, witness a star in the direction of Jerusalem. They take it to be the fulfillment of Balaam’s prophecy that a star shall come out of Jacob (Num. 24:17), so they come to Jerusalem to find the Messianic King.

Herod the Great, Roman-appointed Edomite king of Judea, finds out and is troubled, so he gathers the chief priests and scribes, and they tell him Micah’s prophecy of the coming King from Bethlehem who will shepherd Israel (Mic. 5:2). Herod then summons the wise men to go to Bethlehem to find the Messianic King.

On their way to Bethlehem, the wise men see the star where Jesus is, and follow it. The wise men see Jesus, fall down and worship, and offer him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The wise men are warned in a dream not to return to Herod, so they return home a different way.
