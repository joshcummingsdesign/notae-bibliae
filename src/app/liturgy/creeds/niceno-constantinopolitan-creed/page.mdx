<Poetry>
|  I believe in one God,
|      the Father Almighty,
|      Maker of heaven and earth,
|          of all things visible and invisible.
|
|  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
|      the only-begotten Son of God,
|          born of the Father before all ages,
|      God from God,
|          Light from Light,
|      true God from true God,
|          begotten, not made,
|      consubstantial with the Father;
|           through him all things were made.
|  For us men and for our salvation
|      he came down from heaven,
|      and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
|          and became man.
|  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
|      he suffered death and was buried,
|      and rose again on the third day
|          in accordance with the Scriptures.
|  He ascended into heaven
|      and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
|  He will come again in glory
|      to judge the living and the dead
|          and his kingdom will have no end.
|
|  I believe in the Holy Spirit,
|      the Lord, the giver of life,
|          who proceeds from the Father,
|      who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
|          who has spoken through the prophets.
|
|  I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
|  I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins,
|      and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead,
|          and the life of the world to come. Amen.[^1]
