<Initial text="Chalcedonian Creed" />

<Poetry>
|  Following the holy Fathers,
|      we teach with one voice:
|  that the Son and our Lord Jesus Christ
|      is to be confessed as one and the same;
|  that he is perfect in Godhead and perfect in manhood,
|     very God and very man,
|         of a reasonable soul and body,
|     consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead,
|     and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood;
|         made in all things like us, only without sin;
|     begotten of the Father before all ages according to his Godhead;
|         but in these last days, for us men and for our salvation,
|     born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, according to his manhood.
|  This one and the same Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son,
|      must be confessed to be in two natures
|          unconfusedly, immutably, indivisibly, inseparably;
|      and without the distinction of natures
|          being taken away by such union,
|      but rather the peculiar property of each nature being preserved
|          and being united in one person and subsistence,
|      not separated or divided into two persons,
|          but one and the same Son and only-begotten,
|      God the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ,
|          as the Prophets of old have spoken concerning him,
|      and as the Lord Jesus Christ has taught us,
|          and as the Creed of the Fathers has delivered to us. Amen.[^1]
