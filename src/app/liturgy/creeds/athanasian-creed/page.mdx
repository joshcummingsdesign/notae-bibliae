<Poetry>
|  Whosoever will be saved,
|      before all things it is necessary
|          that he hold the catholic faith.
|      Which faith unless every one do keep whole and undefiled,
|          without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.
|
|  And the catholic faith is this:
|      that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in unity;
|          neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance.
|  For there is one person of the Father,
|      another of the Son,
|          and another of the Holy Spirit.
|  But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son,
|      and of the Holy Spirit is all one;
|          the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.
|  Such as the Father is,
|      such is the Son,
|          and such is the Holy Spirit.
|  The Father uncreated,
|      the Son uncreated,
|          and the Holy Spirit uncreated.
|  The Father incomprehensible,
|      the Son incomprehensible,
|          and the Holy Spirit incomprehensible.
|  The Father eternal,
|      the Son eternal,
|          and the Holy Spirit eternal.
|  And yet they are not three Eternals,
|      but one Eternal.
|  As there are not three Uncreated nor three Incomprehensibles,
|      but one Uncreated and one Incomprehensible.
|  So likewise the Father is almighty,
|      the Son almighty,
|          and the Holy Spirit almighty.
|  And yet they are not three Almighties,
|      but one Almighty.
|  So the Father is God,
|      the Son is God,
|          and the Holy Spirit is God.
|  And yet they are not three Gods,
|      but one God.
|  So likewise the Father is Lord,
|      the Son Lord,
|          and the Holy Spirit Lord.
|  And yet not three Lords,
|      but one Lord.
|  For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity
|      to acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord,
|  so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say,
|      there be three Gods, or three Lords.
|
|  The Father is made of none,
|      neither created nor begotten.
|  The Son is of the Father alone,
|      not made, nor created, but begotten.
|  The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son,
|      neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.
|  So there is one Father, not three Fathers;
|      one Son, not three Sons;
|          one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.
|  And in this Trinity none is before or after other;
|      none is greater or less than another;
|          but the whole three persons are coeternal together, and coequal;
|          so that in all things, as is aforesaid,
|          the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshiped.
|  He, therefore, that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.
|
|  Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation
|      that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
|  For the right faith is that we believe and confess
|      that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man;
|      God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds,
|          and man of the substance of his mother, born in the world;
|      perfect God and perfect man,
|          of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting;
|      equal to the Father as touching his Godhead,
|          and inferior to the Father as touching his manhood;
|      who, although he be God and man,
|          yet he is not two, but one Christ.
|  One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh,
|      but by taking the manhood into God.
|  One altogether, not by confusion of substance,
|      but by unity of person.
|  For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man,
|      so God and man is one Christ;
|  Who suffered for our salvation;
|      descended into hell,
|          rose again the third day from the dead;
|  He ascended into heaven;
|      he sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty;
|          from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
|  At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies,
|      and shall give an account of their own works.
|  And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting;
|      and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.
|
|  This is the catholic faith;
|      which except a man believe faithfully and firmly,
|          he cannot be saved.[^1][^2][^3]
