<Initial text="Nicene Creed" />

<Poetry>
|  I believe in one God,
|      the Father Almighty,
|          Maker of all things visible and invisible.
|
|  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
|      the only-begotten of the Father,
|          of the substance of the Father,
|      God from God,
|          Light of Light,
|      true God from true God,
|          begotten, not made,
|      being of one substance with the Father;
|          through whom all things were made,
|      both in heaven and on earth.
|  Who for us men and for our salvation came down,
|      and was incarnate and was made man.
|  He suffered and the third day he rose again,
|      and ascended into heaven;
|  and he shall come again to judge the living and the dead.
|
|  I believe in the Holy Spirit. Amen.[^1]
