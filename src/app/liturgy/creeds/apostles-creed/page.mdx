<Initial text="Apostles' Creed" />

<Poetry>
|  I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
|      Creator of heaven and earth,
|  and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord,
|      who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
|          born of the Virgin Mary,
|      suffered under Pontius Pilate,
|          was crucified, died, and was buried.
|  He descended into hell;
|      the third day he rose again from the dead.
|  He ascended into heaven,
|      and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
|  From thence he shall come to judge the living and the dead.
|
|  I believe in the Holy Spirit,
|      the holy catholic Church,
|          the communion of saints,
|      the forgiveness of sins,
|          the resurrection of the body,
|      # and life everlasting. Amen.[^1]
