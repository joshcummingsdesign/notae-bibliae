<Initial text="Apostles' Creed" />

<Poetry>
|  I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
|      Maker of heaven and earth:
|  And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord:
|      Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
|          Born of the Virgin Mary:
|      Suffered under Pontius Pilate,
|          Was crucified, dead, and buried:
|  He descended into hell;
|      The third day he rose again from the dead:
|  He ascended into heaven,
|      And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty:
|  From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
|
|  I believe in the Holy Ghost:
|      the holy catholic Church;
|          the Communion of Saints:
|      The Forgiveness of sins:
|          The Resurrection of the body:
|      # And the Life everlasting. Amen.[^1]
