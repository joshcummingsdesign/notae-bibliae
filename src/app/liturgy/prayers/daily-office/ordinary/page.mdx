## Introductory Rites
---

## Silent Prayer

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="officium" text="Office" /> begins with the lighting of a candle, the [Sign of the Cross](/liturgy/prayers/sign-of-the-cross), and kneeling in silent prayer. The candle represents the light of Christ (John 1:1-5), as well as the lamp that burned evening to morning before the Lord in the tabernacle (Ex. 27:20-21). Beeswax candles are the traditional candles used in Christian worship. The pure wax extracted by virgin worker bees symbolizes the pure flesh of Christ, who was born of the Virgin Mary. The wick signifies the soul of Christ, and the flame represents his divinity.[^1]

The 15th-century *Myroure of Our Ladye*, written for the Bridgettine Sisters of Syon Abbey in West London, describes in great detail the purpose of kneeling in silent prayer at the beginning of the Office.

> "Men who live in a land at war keep continual watch in cities, castles, and walled towns. And when an enemy comes near, they ring a certain bell by which all are warned to arm themselves, make ready, and go to their places of defense to fight and drive off their enemies.
>
> In the same way, we are enclosed in this holy monastery as knights in a castle, where we are besieged by a great multitude of fiends who labor night and day to gain entry to our souls and take possession of them. And often they are busiest in the nighttime, when the senses are weighed down with the heaviness of sleep, trying to overcome—or at least to vex and trouble—those whom they could not master by day.
>
> Therefore, when we hear the bell ring for [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins), we ought at once, as true knights of God, to rise quickly, arm ourselves with prayer, make ourselves ready by directing our intention toward God with some devout meditation, and hasten to our place of defense, which is the church, a place fearful to the fiends our enemies, being our stronghold.
>
> There we ought to lift up the long spear of fervent desire from our hearts rising to God, and draw out the sharp sword of the Word of God in his holy service, striking great blows by devout singing and saying of it; by these our enemies shall be rebuked, and we kept safe in godly praises under the banner of his protection.
>
> This readiness to come ought to be kept not only at Matins, but at every hour of the day. For although we sometimes rest from singing or praying with our mouths, our enemies do not rest from warring against us. Therefore we ought never to cease keeping our minds steadfastly fixed on God, and at the time of prayer be ready and glad to go there—as to a stronghold for help, and as to the food and spiritual comfort of our souls.
>
> And when you come to the church before the beginning of each hour, you say an [Our Father](/liturgy/prayers/our-father) and a [Hail Mary](/liturgy/prayers/hail-mary), kneeling. And this is to stir your hearts to greater devotion before you begin your service. And therefore it is said in silence, showing that God is more pleased with the hidden devotion of the heart, to which you ought chiefly to attend in all your service, than with outward noise of the voice."
>

## Opening Sentence

To introduce the Office, an Opening Sentence proper to the day is read. The Opening Sentence is the scriptural call to worship that sets the spiritual tone for the Office. The reading of the Opening Sentence was prescribed in the BCP 1662,[^2] and a selection of Opening Sentences can be found in the <Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Psalter" /> (SDP).[^3]

## General Confession

Then the General Confession is read, which is rooted in the belief that all Christians are called to a life of repentance.

> **"Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.'"**
>
> <cite>Mark 1:14-15</cite>

The 1530 *Augsburg Confession* describes repentance as consisting of two parts: contrition and faith. The former is defined as "terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin," and the latter is defined as "[belief] that for Christ's sake [one's] sins are forgiven," and that this belief "comforts the conscience and delivers it from terrors."[^4] Confession, therefore, is not merely remorse for sin, but trust that God, for Christ's sake, restores the penitent's conscience. Martin Luther's 1529 *Exhortation to Confession* articulates this profound relationship with remarkable clarity and warmth.

> "So notice then, that Confession, as I have often said, consists of two parts. The first is my own work and action, when I lament my sins and desire comfort and refreshment for my soul. The other part is a work that God does when he declares me free of my sin through his word placed in the mouth of a man. It is this splendid, noble, thing that makes Confession so lovely, so comforting."
>
> <cite>[Luther, Exortation to Confession, 1529, par. 15](https://bookofconcord.org/other-resources/sources-and-context/exhortation-to-confession/)</cite>

According to the BCP 1662, the Exhortation, General Confession, and Absolution follow the Opening Sentence.[^5] The BCP 1928 gives an optional shorter version of the Exhortation than the one found in the BCP 1662, which is here used, as it seems more fitting for private devotion.[^6] The SDP states that if a priest is not present, the Absolution may be replaced with the [Collect](/glossary/liturgical-terms#collect) for the Twenty-First Sunday after Trinity, which is here used, as it also seems more fitting for private devotion.[^7]

Note that the Our Father is here omitted to harmonize with the 6th-century *Rule of Saint Benedict*, which places the Our Father at the end of [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds) and [Vespers](/glossary/liturgical-terms#vespers).[^8]

## The Office Proper
---

## Opening Versicles

Then stand for the Opening Versicles.

The chanting of the [Domine labia mea](/liturgy/music/chants/domine-labia-mea), the [Deus in adjutorium](/liturgy/music/chants/deus-in-adjutorium), and the [Gloria Patri](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) at the beginning of the Office goes back to at least the 6th century when it was prescribed in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^9] The English translation comes from the BCP 1549.[^10] The BCP 1662 added "The Lord's Name be praised" in place of the Alleluia so that the ending could be sung <Definition lang="english" anchor="antiphonal" text="antiphonally" />, and to simplify the rubric, as the Alleluia was permitted only at certain times of the year.[^11][^12]

According to the 16th-century [*Roman Breviary*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#breviary), the Sign of the Cross is to be made on the mouth with the thumb of your right hand when saying, "O Lord, open thou my lips."[^13] The custom of bowing in reverence to the Holy Trinity at the Gloria Patri is an ancient one. The 16th-century [*Roman Missal*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#roman-missal) includes it as a rubric for the [Introit](/glossary/liturgical-terms#introit) of the Mass.[^14]

## Invitatory

The chanting of the [Venite](/liturgy/music/chants/venite) goes back to at least the 4th century when it was attested to by [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo).[^15] It was prescribed as the [Invitatory](/glossary/liturgical-terms/#invitatory) for Matins in the 6th-century *Rule of Saint Benedict*.[^16] It is sung to many different tones depending on the season, however, using the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="tonus-peregrinus" text="Tonus Peregrinus" /> and omitting the antiphon seems most appropriate for ferial days.[^17]

According to the BCP 1662, the [Pascha nostrum](/liturgy/music/chants/pascha-nostrum) replaces the Venite on Easter Day;[^18] and according to the BCP 1928, it may be sung until the Second Sunday of Easter, when the Venite is restored to regular use.[^19]

## Psalm

Then sit for the psalm appointed to the day, as the chanting of psalms is properly a meditation.[^20]

Antiphonal psalmody traces back to the Jewish temple, and the early Christians continued on in the regular singing of psalms.[^21] In the 6th century, the *Rule of Saint Benedict* outlined a seven-day psalter, so that by the end of each week all 150 psalms would have been chanted—a task, Benedict notes, that his predecessors had accomplished within a single day.[^22] Benedict prescribed that at Matins the psalms be sung following the Invitatory and a hymn,[^23] and at Vespers after the Opening Versicles.[^24] The BCP 1549 adopted a monthly psalter, retaining the liturgical order but omitting the hymn at Matins.[^25] While one psalm seems suitable for private devotion, an alternative distribution may be used.

## Reading

According to the 6th-century *Rule of Saint Benedict*, the daily readings follow the psalms.[^26] While one reading seems suitable for private devotion, an alternative lectionary system may be used.

## Te Deum

At Matins, the [Te Deum](/liturgy/music/chants/te-deum) is sung standing.

The Te Deum is an ancient hymn from the 4th century, or perhaps even earlier.[^27] The 6th-century *Rule of Saint Benedict* prescribed it for use at Matins after the readings on Lord's Days.[^28] By the 11th century, the rubrics for when to chant the Te Deum were further codified in the [Sarum Rite](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite).[^29][^30]

- Lord's Days outside of Advent and Lent
- Daily during Christmastide
- Daily during Eastertide
- All feast days except for Holy Innocents' Day when it is not on a Lord's Day

When the Te Deum is not sung, it is replaced by an [Old Testament Canticle](/liturgy/psalter#old-testament-canticles) proper to the day.[^31] This harmonizes with the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, which states that an Old Testament Canticle is to be sung at Lauds.[^32]

## Gospel Canticles

[**Benedictus**](/liturgy/music/chants/benedictus)

The *Rule of Saint Benedict* places a Gospel Canticle after the hymn which follows the reading of the Epistle at Lauds.[^33] In 820 AD, Frankish Bishop Amalarius attested to the use of the Benedictus as this canticle.[^34] The Sarum Rite has used the Benedictus as this canticle since the 11th century.[^35]

[**Magnificat**](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat)

The *Rule of Saint Benedict*, places a Gospel Canticle after the hymn which follows the reading at Vespers.[^36] In 820 AD, Amalarius attested to the use of the Magnificat as this canticle.[^37] The Sarum Rite has used the Magnificat as this canticle since the 11th century.[^38]

The last seven nights of Advent, the [O Antiphons](/glossary/liturgical-terms#o-antiphons) are added to the Magnificat at Vespers, and likely have been since as early as the 6th century. [Boethius](/people/scholars/boethius) attests to it in his *Consolation of Philosophy* (524 AD).[^39] During this time Tone II S 1 from the SDP is used.[^40] Otherwise, Tone VIII S 1 is used.[^41]

[**Nunc dimittis**](/liturgy/music/chants/nunc-dimittis)

The Nunc dimittis has been used as an evening prayer since at least the 4th-century when it was included in the *Apostolic Constitutions*.[^42] Since the 11th century, the Sarum Rite has included it after the hymn which follows the reading at [Compline](/glossary/liturgical-terms#compline).[^43]

According to the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />*, the antiphon [Salva nos Domine](/liturgy/music/chants/salva-nos-domine) is added to the Nunc dimittis on Lord's Days.[^44]

## Concluding Rites

---

The *Rule of Saint Benedict* concludes the Office with the [Kyrie](/liturgy/music/chants/kyrie) and the Our Father.[^45] The BCP 1662 concludes with the [Apostles' Creed](/liturgy/creeds/apostles-creed), [Salutation](/glossary/liturgical-terms#salutation), Kyrie, Our Father, [Suffrages](/glossary/liturgical-terms#suffrages), Collects, and the Grace.[^46] The Sarum Rite concludes with the [Benedicamus](/liturgy/music/chants/benedicamus).[^47] The three here have been harmonized for private devotion.

## Apostles' Creed

The Apostles' Creed is read. According to the BCP 1662, the [Athanasian Creed](/liturgy/creeds/athanasian-creed) is read instead at Matins on the following feast days:

- Christmas Day
- Epiphany
- Saint Matthias
- Easter Day
- Ascension Day
- Pentecost
- Nativity of Saint John the Baptist
- Saint James
- Saint Bartholomew
- Saint Matthew
- Saints Simon and Jude
- Saint Andrew
- Trinity Sunday[^48]

## Kyrie

Then kneel for the chanting of the [Kyrie](/liturgy/music/chants/kyrie).

## Our Father

Then the [Our Father](/liturgy/prayers/our-father) is said.

## Collects

Then the Collects are chanted according to the [Sarum Rite rubric](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite/chant-rubric#chanting-the-collect).

## Benedicamus

Then the Benedicamus is chanted.

## The Grace

Finally, according to the BCP 1662, the Grace is said to end the Office.[^49] It is customary to make the Sign of the Cross at this time.[^50] The text of the Grace comes from [St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) closing words to the Corinthians (2 Cor. 13:14).

<Poetry>
|  The grace # of our Lord Jesus Christ,
|      and the love of God,
|      and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,
|          be with us all evermore. Amen.
</Poetry>
