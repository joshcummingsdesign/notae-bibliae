<Poetry>
|  O God, whose only begotten Son,
|      by his life, death, and resurrection,
|          has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life.
|  Grant, we beseech thee,
|      that while meditating on these mysteries
|          of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
|      we may imitate what they contain,
|      and obtain what they promise.
|  Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.[^1]
</Poetry>
