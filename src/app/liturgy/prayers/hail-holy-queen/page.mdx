<Initial text="Hail Holy Queen" />

<Poetry>
|  Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,
|      our life, our sweetness and our hope.
|  To thee do we cry,
|      poor banished children of Eve.
|  To thee do we send up our sighs,
|      mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
|  Turn then, most gracious advocate,
|      thine eyes of mercy toward us,
|      and after this our exile
|          show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
|      O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.[^1]
