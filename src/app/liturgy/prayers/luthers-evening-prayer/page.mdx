<Poetry>
|  I thank thee, my Heavenly Father,
|      through Jesus Christ, thy dear Son,
|          that thou hast graciously kept me this day,
|      and I pray thee to forgive me all my sins,
|          where I have done wrong,
|      and graciously keep me this night.
|  For into thy hands I commend myself,
|      my body and soul, and all things.
|  Let thy holy angel be with me,
|      that the Wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.[^1]
