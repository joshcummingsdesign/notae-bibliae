<Initial text="Hail Mary" />

<Poetry>
|  Hail Mary, full of grace,
|      the Lord is with thee.[^1]
|  Blessed art thou amongst women,
|      and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.[^2]
|  Holy Mary, Mother of God,
|      pray for us sinners,
|          now and at the hour of our death. Amen.[^3]
