<Poetry>
|  I thank thee, my Heavenly Father,
|      through Jesus Christ, thy dear Son,
|          that thou hast kept me this night from all harm and danger,
|      and I pray thee to keep me this day also from sin and all evil,
|          that all my doings and life may please thee.
|  For into thy hands I commend myself,
|      my body and soul, and all things.
|  Let thy holy angel be with me,
|      that the Wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.[^1]
