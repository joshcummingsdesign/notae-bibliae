<Poetry>
|  O my Jesus,
|      forgive us our sins,
|      save us from the fires of hell,
|      and lead all souls to heaven,
|          especially those most in need of thy mercy.[^1]
</Poetry>

[^1]: O My Jesus, also called the Fátima Prayer, originated in 1917 during the Marian apparitions at Fátima, Portugal.
