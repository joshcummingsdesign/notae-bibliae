<Poetry>
|  Our Father, who art in heaven,
|      hallowed be thy name.
|  Thy kingdom come,
|      thy will be done,
|          on earth as it is in heaven.
|  Give us this day our daily bread,
|      and forgive us our trespasses,
|          as we forgive those who trespass against us.
|  And lead us not into temptation,
|      but deliver us from evil.
|  For thine is the kingdom,
|      and the power,
|          and the glory,
|              forever and ever. Amen.[^1]
