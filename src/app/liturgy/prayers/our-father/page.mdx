<Poetry>
|  Our Father, who art in heaven,
|      Hallowed be thy Name.
|  Thy kingdom come.
|      Thy will be done,
|          On earth as it is in heaven.
|  Give us this day our daily bread.
|      And forgive us our trespasses,
|          As we forgive those who trespass against us.
|  And lead us not into temptation,
|      But deliver us from evil.
|  For thine is the kingdom,
|      and the power,
|          and the glory,
|              # forever and ever. Amen.[^1]
