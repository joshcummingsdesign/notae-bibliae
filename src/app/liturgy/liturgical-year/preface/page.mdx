<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Preface" />

This calendar is based on the 1928 American Book of Common Prayer, received here as a faithful representation of the ancient English calendar, made accessible to the laity and adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States.

To broaden the range of feasts and commemorations, the General Roman Calendar has been consulted where the Prayer Book’s calendar is intentionally brief—especially when the General Roman Calendar reflects long-standing Western usage or when such additions are theologically or historically fitting. These supplements are not intended to alter the character of the liturgical year, but to illuminate its continuity and enrich it, in keeping with the broader Western tradition. Civic observances, such as national holidays, have been omitted in order to preserve the calendar’s liturgical focus.

All of the saints’ days are drawn from the General Roman Calendar, except Saint Gregory of Nyssa, which follows the Eastern date of January 10th to preserve the Cappadocian grouping. Saint Matthias is celebrated on May 14th, following the General Roman Calendar’s transfer of his feast from February 24th so as not to be observed in Lent but instead in Eastertide near the Ascension, after which Acts recounts his selection to be numbered with the Twelve Apostles. Saints Peter and Paul are observed jointly, in keeping with the General Roman Calendar. Saint Dunstan is included according to ancient English precedent. Saint Thomas is celebrated on July 3, reflecting the date of his death in the Martyrology of St. Jerome, and following the General Roman Calendar’s transfer of his feast from December 21 to avoid its observance in Advent.

Several feasts and commemorations follow the Church of England’s *<Definition lang="english" anchor="common-worship" text="Common Worship" />*: the celebration of the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary on August 15th, the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary on December 8, Corpus Christi (the Day of Thanksgiving for the Institution of Holy Communion) on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday, and the commemorations of Thomas Cranmer on March 21 and Martin Luther on October 31. According to the General Roman Calendar, the feast of Christ the King marks the culmination of the liturgical year.

It is my most sincere prayer that no unintentional mistakes were made in compiling this calendar, and that its use builds you up in the faith and draws you more deeply into the Church’s continual offering of praise and prayer.
