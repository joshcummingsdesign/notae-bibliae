<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Preface" />

This calendar is based on the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer*, received here as a simplified yet faithful expression of the ancient Western liturgical calendar, adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States.

To supplement the Prayer Book's feasts and commemorations, the Church of England's [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) (2000)—taken here as a scholarly retrieval and scripturally coherent ordering of the Western liturgical year—has been carefully consulted. Each feast and commemoration has been checked against the [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (1969) as a second witness to ensure it reflects the broader Western tradition.

All red-letter days from the Prayer Book are retained, with three exceptions: the feast of [Saint Matthias](/people/saints/apostles/matthias) has been transferred to May 14 to avoid its observance during Lent and to place it near the Ascension, after which the Book of Acts recounts his selection to be numbered with the Twelve; Saints [Peter](/people/saints/apostles/peter) and [Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) are observed jointly on June 29; and the feast of [Saint Thomas](/people/saints/apostles/thomas) has been transferred to July 3 to avoid its observance during Advent and to coincide with the date of his death in the [*Martyrology of Saint Jerome*](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon).

As a general rubric, only pre-Reformation saints that appear in both *Common Worship* and the General Roman Calendar are commemorated. Civic observances, such as national holidays, have been omitted in order to preserve the calendar’s liturgical focus.

It is my most sincere prayer that no unintentional mistakes were made in compiling this calendar, and that its use builds you up in the faith and draws you more deeply into the Church’s continual offering of praise and prayer.

*— J. C. Cummings*
