<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Preface" />

This calendar is based on the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer*, received here as a faithful representation of the ancient Western liturgical calendar, rendered accessible to the laity and adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States. To enrich devotional life throughout the year, the Prayer Book calendar has been supplemented with feasts and commemorations drawn principally from the [Use of Sarum](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite). Civic observances have been omitted to maintain the calendar's liturgical focus.

One might rightly ask whether it is appropriate to supplement the Prayer Book calendar, to which I respond: while the Prayer Book is fully capable of standing on its own, devout Christians throughout the centuries have supplemented its observances to preserve the rich liturgical heritage handed down by their spiritual predecessors. In light of this long-standing precedent, the question is not whether supplementation is appropriate, but rather which observances are most fitting to include. To answer this question, two guiding principles have been applied: (1) observances must demonstrate continuity with the Prayer Book's liturgical heritage, and (2) observances must reflect long-standing usage in the Western tradition.

To demonstrate continuity, observances must be attested in the pre-Reformation [breviary](/glossary/liturgical-terms#breviary) tradition, particularly within the English uses. The breviaries consulted were the [York Breviary](/glossary/liturgical-terms#use-of-york) (1493), the [Hereford Breviary](/glossary/liturgical-terms#use-of-hereford) (1505), the [Aberdeen Breviary](/glossary/liturgical-terms#aberdeen-breviary) (1510), the [Roman Breviary](/liturgy/rites/roman-rite) (1529), and the [Sarum Breviary](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite) (1531).

To reflect long-standing usage, observances must also appear in two modern calendars grounded in extensive historical and liturgical scholarship: the [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (1969) and the Church of England's [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) (2000).

The resulting calendar captures the spirit of the ancient Sarum Use, while allowing the Prayer Book's simplicity to shine in the foreground. Because each observance is well attested, the calendar may be used with the utmost confidence.

It is my most sincere prayer that no unintentional errors were made in compiling this calendar, and that its use builds you up in the faith and draws you more deeply into the Church's continual offering of praise and prayer.
