The calendar used here is based on the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer*, received here as a faithful representation of the ancient Western calendar, made accessible to the laity and adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States.

To give fuller expression to the liturgical year’s feasts and commemorations, the General Roman Calendar has been consulted where the Prayer Book’s calendar is intentionally brief—especially where it reflects long-standing Western usage or where such additions are theologically or historically fitting. These supplements are not intended to alter the character of the liturgical year, but to enrich it, in keeping with the broader Western tradition.

Saints’ days are drawn from the General Roman Calendar, except [Saint Gregory of Nyssa](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/gregory-of-nyssa), whose commemoration follows the Eastern date of January 10th in order to preserve the January grouping of the three [Cappadocian Fathers](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers). [Saint Matthias](/people/saints/apostles/matthias) is celebrated on May 14th—following the General Roman Calendar’s transfer of his feast from February 24th—to avoid its observance in Lent, and so that it falls in Eastertide near the Ascension, after which the Acts of the Apostles recounts his selection to be numbered with the Twelve. Saints [Peter](/people/saints/apostles/peter) and [Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) are observed jointly on June 29th, in keeping with the General Roman Calendar. [Saint Dunstan](/people/saints/medieval/dunstan-of-canterbury) is included on May 19th according to ancient English precedent. [Saint Thomas](/people/saints/apostles/thomas) is celebrated on July 3rd, reflecting the date of his death in the [*Martyrology of Saint Jerome*](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon), and following the General Roman Calendar’s transfer of his feast from December 21st to avoid its observance in Advent.

Several feasts and observances follow the Church of England’s *<Definition lang="english" anchor="common-worship" text="Common Worship" />*: the feast of the [Blessed Virgin Mary](/people/saints/biblical/blessed-virgin-mary) on August 15th, the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary on December 8th, Corpus Christi (the Day of Thanksgiving for the Institution of Holy Communion) on the Thursday After Trinity Sunday, and the commemorations of [Thomas Cranmer](/meditations/a-brief-history-of-the-reformation-part-3#the-book-of-common-prayer) and [Martin Luther](/meditations/a-brief-history-of-the-reformation-part-3#martin-luther) on March 21st and October 31st, respectively.

According to the General Roman Calendar, the feast of Christ the King marks the culmination of the liturgical year. Civic observances, such as national holidays, have been omitted in order to preserve the calendar’s liturgical focus.

It is my most sincere prayer that no unintentional mistakes were made in compiling this calendar, and that its use builds you up in the faith and draws you more deeply into the Church’s continual offering of praise and prayer.
