<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Preface" />

The calendar presented here is based on the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer*, a simplified yet faithful expression of the ancient Western liturgical calendar, thoughtfully adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States.

While the Prayer Book calendar is excellent and fully capable of standing on its own, devout Christians throughout the centuries have supplemented its observances by drawing upon the ancient <Definition lang="latin" anchor="usus" text="Church Uses" />—not to replace the Prayer Book, but to ensure the full richness of the English Offices and continuity with historic devotional practice. The question, then, is not whether supplementation is appropriate, but rather which observances ought to be supplemented. This calendar therefore applies two guiding criteria to determine which observances should be supplemented: (1) they have endured through the generations, and (2) they demonstrate clear continuity with the Western liturgical heritage.

To apply these criteria in a principled and consistent manner, two calendars grounded in extensive historical and liturgical scholarship were carefully consulted: the [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (1969) and the Church of England’s [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) calendar (2000). Observances were supplemented only when they (1) appear in both calendars and (2) are attested in the pre-Reformation English breviary tradition. The breviaries consulted for this purpose were the [York Breviary](/glossary/liturgical-terms#use-of-york) (1493), the [Hereford Breviary](/glossary/liturgical-terms#use-of-hereford) (1505), the [Aberdeen Breviary](/glossary/liturgical-terms#aberdeen-breviary) (1510), the [Roman Breviary](/liturgy/rites/roman-rite) (1529), and the [Sarum Breviary](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite) (1531).

As a matter of good order, the dates of the General Roman Calendar have generally been adopted, as they more closely align with the Gospel narrative. For example, the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary is observed on May 31, placing it between the Annunciation of the Lord and the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. Civic observances have been omitted in order to maintain the calendar’s liturgical focus.

The resulting calendar is both well ordered and well attested, and may therefore be used with the utmost confidence. It is my most sincere prayer that no unintentional errors were made in compiling this calendar, and that its use builds you up in the faith and draws you more deeply into the Church’s continual offering of praise and prayer.
