<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Preface" />

This calendar is based on the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer*, received here as a simplified yet faithful expression of the ancient Western liturgical calendar, adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States. Its structure provides the foundation for the calendar presented here.

This foundation is enriched through the modern scholarship provided in the Church of England’s [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) (2000), which offers historically-grounded and theologically-fitting feasts and commemorations. These feasts and commemorations are then checked against the [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (1969) to ensure that the resulting observances remain in continuity with the broader Western tradition.

Red-letter days are retained from the Prayer Book, with three exceptions: the feast of [Saint Matthias](/people/saints/apostles/matthias) has been transferred to May 14 to avoid its observance during Lent and to place it near the Ascension, after which the Book of Acts recounts his selection to be numbered with the Twelve; Saints [Peter](/people/saints/apostles/peter) and [Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) are observed jointly on June 29; and the feast of [Saint Thomas](/people/saints/apostles/thomas) has been transferred to July 3 to avoid its observance during Advent and to coincide with the date of his death in the [*Martyrology of Saint Jerome*](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon).

As a general rubric, only pre-Reformation saints that appear in both *Common Worship* and the General Roman Calendar are commemorated. To account for the fact that *Common Worship* commemorates many key Reformation figures while the General Roman Calendar does not, October 31 has been marked as Reformation Day to preserve the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="via-media" text="via media" />* between the two traditions. Civic observances, such as national holidays, have been omitted in order to preserve the calendar’s liturgical focus.

It is my most sincere prayer that no unintentional mistakes were made in compiling this calendar, and that its use builds you up in the faith and draws you more deeply into the Church’s continual offering of praise and prayer.

*— J. C. Cummings*
