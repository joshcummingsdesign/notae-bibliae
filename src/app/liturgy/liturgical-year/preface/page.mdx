<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Preface" />

This calendar is based on the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer*, received here as a simplified yet faithful expression of the ancient Western liturgical calendar, adapted to the pastoral needs of Christians in the United States.

To supplement the provision of feasts and commemorations throughout the liturgical year, two modern calendars have been carefully consulted: the [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (1969) and the Church of England’s [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) (2000). As a general rubric, feasts and commemorations are only included when they (1) appear in both calendars and (2) are attested in a well-respected pre-Reformation breviary. The breviaries consulted for this purpose were the York Breviary (1493), the Hereford Breviary (1505), the Aberdeen Breviary (1510), the Roman Breviary (1529), and the [Sarum Breviary](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite) (1531).

As a matter of good order, the dates of the General Roman Calendar have generally been adopted, as they more closely align with the Gospel narrative. For example, the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary is observed on May 31, placing it between the Annunciation of the Lord and the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. The ranking system used represents a simplified harmonization of the aforementioned traditions. Civic observances have been omitted in order to maintain the calendar’s liturgical focus.

The resulting calendar is both well ordered and well attested, and may therefore be used with the utmost confidence. It is my most sincere prayer that no unintentional errors were made in compiling this calendar, and that its use builds you up in the faith and draws you more deeply into the Church’s continual offering of praise and prayer.
