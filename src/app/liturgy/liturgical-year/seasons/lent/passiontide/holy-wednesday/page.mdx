## Significance

On Wednesday, the day before the Passover which begins at sundown, Judas Iscariot succumbs to the enemy. He goes to the chief priests and the elders, and they agree to pay him 30 pieces of silver if he delivers Jesus to them. Judas Iscariot then lies in wait for Jesus. Being the day on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, Peter and John come to Jesus to ask where they should prepare for him to eat the Passover. He tells them to go into the city, and they will find a man carrying a jar of water. He says he will invite them in, and show them a large, furnished upper room where they are to prepare the Passover.
