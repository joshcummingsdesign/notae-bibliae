Forty-Six Days Before Easter

## Significance

Ash Wednesday is 46 days before [Easter](/liturgy/liturgical-year/seasons/eastertide/easter-day) (40 days plus the six Sundays leading up to Easter, which are traditionally not fast days). It is a day of fasting and penance, and begins the season of [Lent](/liturgy/liturgical-year/seasons/lent). Ashes have a long biblical history of signifying repentance (Dan. 9:3). Traditionally, on Ash Wednesday, one receives the [Sign of the Cross](/meditations/the-history-of-the-sign-of-the-cross) in ashes on one's forehead. This is an outward sign of the inward faith and repentance to which Jesus called us (Mark 1:14-15).
