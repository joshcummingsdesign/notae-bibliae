December 25

## Significance

<Definition lang="english" anchor="christmas" text="Christmas Day" />, aslo called the Nativity of the Lord, is the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

## Dates

Tradition holds that Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit on March 25th, which coincides with the day he was crucified ([Augustine, On the Trinity, Book IV, par. 9](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130104.htm)). Thus, the Annunciation is celebrated on March 25th, and Christmas is celebrated on December 25th.

Interestingly, if Zechariah entered the temple to burn incense on <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="yom-kippur" text="Yom Kippur" /> in September (Luke 1:8-9), and Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit six months later on Passover in March (Luke 1:26-27), nine months after that would be December.
