## Significance

Herod the Great summons the wise men to go to Bethlehem to find the Messianic King. On their way to Bethlehem, the wise men see the star where Jesus is, and follow it. The wise men see Jesus, fall down and worship, and offer him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The wise men are warned in a dream not to return to Herod, so they return home a different way. An angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream and tells him to take Mary and Jesus and flee to Egypt as Herod was out to destroy Jesus. They flee to Egypt which coincides with Hosea's prophecy, "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hos. 11:1). Herod realizes that the wise men had not returned, and so he kills all the male children two and under in Bethlehem. This coincides with Jeremiah's prophecy that "Rachel is weeping for her children" (Jer. 31:15).
