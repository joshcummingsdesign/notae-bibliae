September 8

## Significance

Since as early as the 6th century, the Church has observed the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary on September 8.[^1] The feast honors Mary as specially chosen and prepared by God to bear Jesus. It highlights her purity, devotion, and obedience from the very beginning of her life. It marks a devotional opportunity to reflect on God's providence and Mary's faithfulness, encouraging the faithful to follow her example of obedience to God. It is observed as a joyful remembrance that Mary's life is inseparable from the Incarnation of Christ, and therefore her birth marks the first light before the rising of the Sun of Righteousness.
