August 6 (Forty Days Before Holy Cross Day)

## Significance

The feast of the Transfiguration commemorates the transfiguration of Jesus. The word transfiguration comes from the Latin *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="transfiguratio" text="transfiguratio" />* which means "a major change in appearance or form", and refers to an experience of momentary divine radiance in which Jesus becomes radiant in glory upon a mountain, traditionally identified as Mount Tabor, though the location is debated. Although Scripture does not tell us the date of the Transfiguration, is has been traditionally celebrated on August 6th, 40 days before [Holy Cross Day](/liturgy/liturgical-year/seasons/trinitytide/holy-cross-day). The 40 days between Transfiguration and the Cross mirrors a spiritual journey—a movement from glory to suffering, from the mount of divine light (Tabor) to the mount of sacrifice (Calvary).
