Sunday Before the First Sunday of Advent

## Significance

The feast of Christ the King celebrates the sovereignty of Jesus Christ over all creation. Originally established in 1925 by Pope Pius XI as a response to rising secularism and nationalism, its central message is that no earthly power, ideology, or allegiance outranks the reign of Christ, whose kingdom is marked not by coercion but by truth, justice, mercy, and peace. Christ the King concludes the liturgical year, and serves as a theological "summit" that looks ahead to Christ's final reconciliation of all things, tying together themes of judgment, hope, and the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom before Advent begins.
