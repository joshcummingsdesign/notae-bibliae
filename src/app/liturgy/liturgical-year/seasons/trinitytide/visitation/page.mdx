## Significance

The feast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary celebrates the the visit of Mary, who was pregnant with Jesus, to Elizabeth, who was pregnant with Saint John the Baptist.

After the angel Gabriel foretells to Mary the birth of Christ, Mary goes to the hill country of Judea (likely Hebron) to visit her relative Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist. Baby John leaps in Elizabeth's womb and Elizabeth is filled with the Holy Spirit. She blesses Mary, and Mary prays the [Magnificat](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat), which begins with, "My soul magnifies the Lord" (Luke 1:46). She thanks God for his grace and mercy, and for exalting the humble.

In 1389, Pope Urban VI added the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the Roman Calendar for celebration on July 2. The 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar observes it on May 31 so that it falls between the Annunciation of the Lord and the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, which more closely aligns with the Gospel narrative.
