## Significance

All Saints' Day, also known as <Definition lang="english" anchor="hallow" text="All Hallows' Day" />, is a feast of the highest rank honoring of all the saints of the Church, whether they are known or unknown. From the 4th century, feasts commemorating all Christian martyrs were held in various places, on various dates near Easter and Pentecost. In the 9th century, some churches in the British Isles began holding a commemoration of all saints on November 1, and in the 9th century this was extended to the whole Catholic Church by Pope Gregory IV.
