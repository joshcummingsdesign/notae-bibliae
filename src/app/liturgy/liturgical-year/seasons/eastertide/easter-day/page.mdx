Sunday on or After the Psachal Full Moon

## Significance

Passover begins at sundown on the 14th of Abib, which technically begins the day of the 15th (Ex. 12:6). This coincides with the first full moon after the spring equinox. The first full moon after the spring equinox is called the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="paschalis" text="paschal full moon" />. The resurrection of Jesus (the celebration of which we call Easter) occurred on the day after a very special Sabbath that occurred during the week of Passover (John 19:31).

On Sunday, the third day after Jesus' crucifixion, the day of the Feast of the Firstfruits, early in the morning while it is still dark, Mary Magdalene goes back to the tomb. When she arrives, she sees the stone rolled back from the tomb and the guards on the ground trembling with fear. She runs to tell Peter and John, who see the empty tomb and Jesus' folded grave clothes. Jesus then appears to Mary Magdalene and the disciples.
