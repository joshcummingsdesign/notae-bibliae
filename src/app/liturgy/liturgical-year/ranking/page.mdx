<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Ranking" />

The following ranking system is a harmonization of the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer* and the [Use of Sarum](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite). The calendar presented here employs this ranking system not only for simplicity and practicality, but because it attempts to demonstrate continuity with the Prayer Book’s liturgical heritage, and reflect long-standing usage in the Western tradition.
