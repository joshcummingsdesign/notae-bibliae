<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Ranking" />

This calendar uses the following ranking system, which is a simplified harmonization of the [Use of Sarum](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite), the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer*, the [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (1969), and the Church of England's [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) (2000). This system is used not only for simplicity and practicality, but because it attempts to reflect the broader Western liturgical tradition.
