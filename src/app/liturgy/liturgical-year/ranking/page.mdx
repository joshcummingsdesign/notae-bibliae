<Initial text="Liturgical Year: Ranking" />

The following is a harmonization of the ranking systems used in the 1928 American *Book of Common Prayer* and the [Use of Sarum](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite). This ranking system is used not only for simplicity and practicality, but because this calendar supplements the Prayer Book's observances with those from the Use of Sarum in order to preserve the Prayer Book's rich liturgical heritage.
