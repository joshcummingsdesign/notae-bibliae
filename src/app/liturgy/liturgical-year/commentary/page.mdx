**January 1**<br/>
**Circumcision and Holy Name of Jesus**<br/>
*Feast*

"The Circumcision of Christ" according to the Prayer Book. The [Sarum Breviary](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite) (1531) has two related feasts: The Circumcision of the Lord on January 1 and The Most Holy Name of Jesus on August 7. Both relate to the same event, but the former's focus is on the event itself, while the latter's focus is on the intrinsic power of Jesus' Name. The [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (1969) adds The Most Holy Name of Jesus as an optional memorial on January 3. The Church of England's [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) (2000), combines the two feasts, calling it "The Naming and Circumcision of Jesus." To keep the spirit of both feasts, the title [Circumcision and Holy Name of Jesus](/liturgy/liturgical-year/seasons/christmastide/circumcision-and-holy-name-of-jesus) is here used.

**Repose of the Blessed Virgin Mary**<br/>
*Feast*

August 15 has long been observed as a Marian feast, however, through the centuries it has been known by different titles. The Eastern Church refers to it as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="dormitionem" text="Dormition of the" /> *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="theotokos" text="Theotokos" />*, confessing both the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="repauso" text="repose" /> and the bodily assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Roman Catholic Church refers to it as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="assumptio" text="Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary" />, affirming her bodily assumption without requiring an explicit affirmation of her repose—though many Roman Catholics would affirm her repose as well. *Common Worship* lists this day simply as "The Blessed Virgin Mary," omitting further theological definition where Scripture is silent. [*Breviary Offices*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#breviary-offices) (1874) refers to this feast as the [Repose of the Blessed Virgin Mary](/people/saints/biblical/blessed-virgin-mary), the title here used, as it affirms Mary's rest in Christ while leaving the manner of her glorification reverently undefined.
