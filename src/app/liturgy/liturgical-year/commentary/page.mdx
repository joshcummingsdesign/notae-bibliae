**<Red text="January 1 — Circumcision and Holy Name of Jesus"/>**

"The Circumcision of Christ" according to the Prayer Book. The [Sarum Breviary](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite) (1531) has two related feasts: The Circumcision of the Lord on January 1 and The Most Holy Name of Jesus on August 7. Both relate to the same event, but the former's focus is on the event itself, where the latter's focus is on the intrinsic power of Jesus' Name. The 1969 revision of the [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (GRC) adds The Most Holy Name of Jesus as an optional Memorial on January 3. The Church of England's [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) (CW), published in 2000, combines the two feasts, calling it "The Naming and Circumcision of Jesus." To keep the spirit of both feasts, the title ["Circumcision and Holy Name of Jesus"](/liturgy/liturgical-year/seasons/christmastide/circumcision-and-holy-name-of-jesus) is here used.
