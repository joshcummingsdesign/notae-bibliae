**<Red text="January 1 — Circumcision and Holy Name of Jesus"/>**

The Prayer Book lists this as the "Circumcision of Christ". The [Sarum Breviary](/liturgy/rites/sarum-rite) (1531) had two related but separate feasts: the Circumcision of the Lord on January 1 and the Most Holy Name of Jesus on August 7. Both relate to the same event, but the former's focus is more on the event itself, where the latter's focus is more on the intrinsic power of Jesus' Name. In the 1969 revision of the [General Roman Calendar](/glossary/liturgical-terms#general-roman-calendar) (GRC), the Most Holy Name of Jesus was added as an optional Memorial on January 3. The Church of England's [*Common Worship*](/glossary/liturgical-terms#common-worship) (CW), published in 2000, combines the two feasts, calling it the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus. To keep the spirit of both feasts, the title [Circumcision and Holy Name of Jesus](/liturgy/liturgical-year/seasons/christmastide/circumcision-of-the-lord) has been here used.

**January 2 — Saint Basil the Great, Bishop and Doctor of the Church**

The Sarum Breviary lists [Saint Basil the Great](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/basil-the-great) on June 14, the date believed to be that of his ordination as bishop. Tradition holds that the date of his death is January 1, thus the GRC moved his commemoration to January 2 so that it wouldn't overlap with the feast of the Circumcision.

**<Red text="January 6 — The Epiphany" />**

[The Epiphany](/liturgy/liturgical-year/seasons/epiphanytide/epiphany), or the Manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles, is maintained on January 6—twelve days after Christmas—according to ancient precedent.

**<Red text="February 2 — Presentation of the Lord (Purification)" />**

The Prayer Book lists this as the "Presentation of Christ in the Temple, commonly called the Purification of Saint Mary the Virgin." It is sometimes also referred to as Candlemas, as the blessing and use of candles is common on this day. The title [Presentation of the Lord](/liturgy/liturgical-year/seasons/epiphanytide/presentation-of-the-lord) is here used, and the title Purification is put in parenthesis for quick Prayer Book reference.

**<Red text="July 3 — Saint Thomas, Apostle" />**

The Prayer Book lists [Saint Thomas](/people/saints/apostles/matthias) on December 21 by ancient precedent.

Christians who hold that Mary was bodily assumed into heaven have referred to it as the Assumption. Those who hold that she first fell asleep (cf. Matt. 27:51-53) have referred to it as the Dormition. Others have simply celebrated it as a feast for the Mother of God. To preserve the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="via-media" text="via media" />*, the simple title [Blessed Virgin Mary](/people/saints/biblical/blessed-virgin-mary) has been here used.
