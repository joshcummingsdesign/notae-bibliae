Psalm 51:1-19

Matthew 16:15-19

<small>*From a commentary on Matthew by [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas), Priest and Doctor of the Church.*</small>

> "But let us see what the keys are. When a house is locked, it obstructs entry; but a key removes the obstacle. The kingdom of heaven had an obstacle, but not on its own part; 'I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven' (Rev 4:1), but the obstacle was on our part, namely, sin, because 'there shall not enter into it anything defiled' (Rev 21:27). Christ removed this impediment by his passion, because 'he washed us from our sins in his blood' (Rev 1:5). And he communicated this so that sins might be removed through a ministry, which is completed by the strength of Christ's blood. Hence the Sacraments have strength from the strength of Christ's passion. Hence I will give to you a ministry."

[^1]: The candle represents the light of Christ (John 1:1-5), as well as the lamp that burned evening to morning before the Lord in the tabernacle (Ex. 27:20-21). The use of the [Sign of the Cross](/meditations/the-history-of-the-sign-of-the-cross) traces back to as early as the 3rd century. Beginning in silent prayer serves to prepare your heart and mind for worship.
[^2]: The reading of the Opening Sentence in the Introductory Rites of [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins) was prescribed in the [*Book of Common Prayer*](https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/the-book-of-common-prayer-1662.pdf) (1662), p. 9, and a selection of Opening Sentences can be found in the *<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter" />* (2002), p. 256.
[^3]: The Introductory Rites of Matins in the BCP 1662, pp. 9–10, include the Exhortation, General Confession, and Absolution. For private devotion, however, [Daily Repentance](/meditations/philip-melanchthon-on-repentance) is a fitting substitute for this section (Mark 1:14-15).
[^4]: The Collect for the Twenty-First Sunday after Trinity (BCP 1662, p. 118), which according to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 232, may replace the Absolution if a priest is not present. The language here has been adapted for private devotion.
[^5]: The chanting of the [Domine labia mea](/liturgy/music/chants/domine-labia-mea), the [Deus in adjutorium](/liturgy/music/chants/deus-in-adjutorium), and the [Gloria Patri](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) at the beginning of Matins goes back to at least the 6th century when it was prescribed in the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*](https://www.solesmes.com/sites/default/files/upload/pdf/rule_of_st_benedict.pdf), ch. 9. The English translation comes from the [BCP 1549](https://archive.org/details/bookofcommonpraycs00chur/page/n29/mode/2up), p. 1. The BCP 1662, p. 11, added "The Lord's Name be praised" in place of the Alleluia so that the ending could be sung <Definition lang="english" anchor="antiphonal" text="antiphonally" />, and to simplify the rubric, as the Alleluia was permitted only at certain times of the year (see the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 15). According to the 16th-century [Roman Breviary](https://ia904607.us.archive.org/34/items/TheRomanBreviaryV1/TheRomanBreviaryV1.pdf), ch. 13, par. 1, the first Sign of the Cross is to be made on the mouth with the thumb of your right hand. The chant tone for the Opening Versicles comes from the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 245, where it also says that the first Sign of the Cross is to be made on the lips. The custom of bowing in reverence to the Holy Trinity at the Gloria Patri is an ancient one. The 16th-century [Roman Missal](https://media.churchmusicassociation.org/pdf/romanmissal_classical.pdf), p. 62, includes it as a rubric for the [Introit](/glossary/liturgical-terms#introit) of the Mass.
[^6]: <Red text="‡" /> According to the BCP 1662, p. 83, the [Pascha nostrum](/liturgy/music/chants/pascha-nostrum) replaces the Venite on Easter Sunday, and according to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 342, it may be sung through the week of Easter.
[^7]: According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 294, the use of the Venite in the [Divine Office](/glossary/liturgical-terms#divine-office) goes back to at least the 4th century when it was attested to by [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo). It was prescribed as the Invitatory for Matins in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 9.
[^8]: According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. vi, par. 2, antiphonal psalmody traces back to the Jewish temple, and according to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 9, the chanting of psalms at Matins follows the Invitatory and the singing of a hymn.
[^9]: According to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 9, the daily readings follow the chanting of psalms.
[^10]: According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 297, the Te Deum is from the 4th century, or perhaps even earlier, and according to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 11, it is to be chanted after the readings on Lord's Days. By the 11th century, the rubrics for when to chant the Te Deum were further codified in the [Sarum Rite](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sarum-rite) (see the [Sarum Rite rubrics for Matins](https://sarum-chant.ca/resources/anatomy-of-the-sarum-liturgy/matins/)), and are outlined in the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 235.
[^11]: According to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 12, the Benedicite was to be chanted after the psalms at [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds) on Lord's Days, and according to ch. 13, an Old Testament Canticle proper to the day was to be chanted at Lauds on weekdays, and the Song of Moses from Deut. was to be chanted at Lauds on Saturdays. It is therefore fitting that the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 236, states that an Old Testament Canticle may replace the Te Deum on days when it is not sung. Additionally, the distribution of the Old Testament Canticles found on p. iv—which is said to be from the ancient Church of England—harmonizes with the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.
[^12]: <Red text="‡" /> According to the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />* (1961), p. 398, the antiphon [Facta est cum Angelo](/liturgy/music/chants/facta-est-cum-angelo) is added to the Benedicite on Christmas Day.
[^13]: The chant tone for the Benedicite, "Tone VII 4", comes from the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 505.
[^14]: The *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 12, places a Gospel Canticle after the hymn which follows the reading of the Epistle at Lauds. According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 300, in 820 AD, Frankish Bishop Amalarius attested to the use of the Benedictus as this canticle. The Sarum Rite has used the Benedictus as this canticle since the 11th century (see the [Sarum Rite rubrics for Lauds](https://sarum-chant.ca/resources/anatomy-of-the-sarum-liturgy/lauds/)).
[^15]: The *Rule of Saint Benedict*, chs. 12–13, ends Lauds with the [Kyrie](/liturgy/music/chants/kyrie) and the Our Father. The BCP 1662, pp. 16-17, ends Matins with the Apostles' Creed, [Salutation](/glossary/liturgical-terms#salutation), Kyrie, Our Father, [Suffrages](/glossary/liturgical-terms#suffrages), Collect, and the Grace. The Sarum Rite places the Benedicamus at the end of Lauds (see the aforementined rubrics for Lauds). The three here have been harmonized for private devotion.
