Psalm 51:1-19 — David — Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God

Matthew 16:18-19 — The Keys to the Kingdom

From a commentary on Matthew by [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas), Priest and Doctor of the Church.

> "But let us see what the keys are. When a house is locked, it obstructs entry; but a key removes the obstacle. The kingdom of heaven had an obstacle, but not on its own part; 'I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven' (Rev 4:1), but the obstacle was on our part, namely, sin, because 'there shall not enter into it anything defiled' (Rev 21:27). Christ removed this impediment by his passion, because 'he washed us from our sins in his blood' (Rev 1:5). And he communicated this so that sins might be removed through a ministry, which is completed by the strength of Christ's blood. Hence the Sacraments have strength from the strength of Christ's passion. Hence I will give to you a ministry."

[^1]: The candle represents the light of Christ (John 1:1-5), as well as the lamp that burned evening to morning before the Lord in the tabernacle (Ex. 27:20-21). The use of the [Sign of the Cross](/meditations/the-history-of-the-sign-of-the-cross) traces back to as early as the 3rd century. Beginning in silent prayer serves to prepare your heart and mind for worship.
[^2]: The reading of the Opening Sentence in the Introductory Rites of [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins) was prescribed in the [*Book of Common Prayer*](https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/the-book-of-common-prayer-1662.pdf) (1662), p. 9, and a selection of Opening Sentences can be found in the *<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter" />* (2002), p. 256.
[^3]: The Introductory Rites of Matins in the BCP 1662, p. 9, includes the recitation of the Absolution by a priest. For private devotional use, the practice of daily [repentance](/meditations/philip-melanchthon-on-repentance) is a fitting choice to replace this section.
[^4]: According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 232, if a priest is not present, the Absolution may be replaced with the Collect for the Twenty-First Sunday after Trinity (BCP 1662, p. 118), thus it is a fitting choice to end the Introductory Rites.
[^5]: The chanting of the [Domine labia mea](/liturgy/music/chants/domine-labia-mea), the [Deus in adjutorium](/liturgy/music/chants/deus-in-adjutorium), and the [Gloria Patri](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) at the beginning of Matins goes back to at least the 6th century when it was prescribed in the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*](https://www.solesmes.com/sites/default/files/upload/pdf/rule_of_st_benedict.pdf), ch. 9. The English translation comes from the BCP 1549, p. 1. The BCP 1662, p. 11, added the words "The Lord's Name be praised" so that the ending could be sung <Definition lang="english" anchor="antiphonal" text="antiphonally" />, and to simplify the rubrics around when "Alleluia" could be said (see the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 15). The chant tone for the Opening Versicles comes from the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 245, where it also says that the first Sign of the Cross is to be made on the lips.
[^6]: <Red text="‡" /> According to the BCP 1662, p. 83, the [Pascha nostrum](/liturgy/music/chants/pascha-nostrum) replaces the Venite on Easter Sunday, and according to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 342, it may be sung through the week of Easter.
[^7]: According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 294, the use of the Venite as the Invitatory for Matins goes back to at least the 4th century when it was attested to by [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo). It is also prescribed in the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 9.
[^8]: According to the *Saint Dunstan’s Psalter*, p. vi, par. 2, antiphonal psalmody traces back to the Jewish temple, and according to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 9, the chanting of psalms at Matins follows the Invitatory and the singing of a hymn.
[^9]: According to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 9, the daily readings follow the chanting of psalms.
[^10]: According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 297, the Te Deum is from as early as the 4th century, and according to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 11, it is to be chanted after the readings on Lord's Days. By the 11th century, the rubrics for when to chant the Te Deum were further codified in the [Sarum Rite](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sarum-rite) (see the [Sarum Rite rubrics for Matins](https://sarum-chant.ca/resources/anatomy-of-the-sarum-liturgy/matins/)), which are outlined in the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 235.
[^11]: According to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 12, the Benedicite was to be chanted after the psalms at [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds) on Lord's Days, and according to ch. 13, the Old Testament Canticles were to be chanted at Lauds on weekdays, and the Song of Moses from Deut. was to be chanted on Saturdays. It is therefore fitting that the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 236, states that the Te Deum may be replaced with an Old Testament Canticle on days when it is not said. Additionally, the order of the Old Testament Canticles found on p. iv—which is said to be from the ancient Church of England—harmonizes with the *Rule of Saint Benedict*.
[^12]: <Red text="‡" /> According to the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />* (1961), p. 398, the antiphon [Facta est cum Angelo](/liturgy/music/chants/facta-est-cum-angelo) is added to the Benedicite on Christmas Day.
[^13]: The chant tone for the Benedicite, "Tone VII 4", comes from the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 505.
[^14]: The *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 12, places a Gospel Canticle after the hymn which follows the reading of the Epistle at Lauds. According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 300, in 820 AD, Frankish Bishop Amalarius attested to the use of the Benedictus as this canticle. The Sarum Rite has used the Benedictus as this canticle since the 11th century (see the [Sarum Rite rubrics for Lauds](https://sarum-chant.ca/resources/anatomy-of-the-sarum-liturgy/lauds/)).
[^15]: The *Rule of Saint Benedict*, chs. 12–13, ends Lauds with the [Kyrie](/liturgy/music/chants/kyrie) and the Our Father. The BCP 1662, pp. 16-17, ends Matins with the Apostles' Creed, [Salutation](/glossary/liturgical-terms#salutation), Kyrie, Our Father, [Suffrages](/glossary/liturgical-terms#suffrages), Collect, and the Grace. The Sarum Rite places the Benedicamus at the end of Lauds (see the aforementined rubrics for Lauds). Thus the three here have been harmonized for private devotional use. The tone for the Benedicamus, "Benedicamus II", comes from the *Liber Usualis*, p. 22.
