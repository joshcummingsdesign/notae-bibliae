Psalm 51:1-19 — David — Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God

Matthew 16:18-19 — The Keys to the Kingdom

From a commentary on Matthew by [St. Thomas Aquinas](/people/saints/medieval/thomas-aquinas), Priest and Doctor of the Church.

> "But let us see what the keys are. When a house is locked, it obstructs entry; but a key removes the obstacle. The kingdom of heaven had an obstacle, but not on its own part; 'I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven' (Rev 4:1), but the obstacle was on our part, namely, sin, because 'there shall not enter into it anything defiled' (Rev 21:27). Christ removed this impediment by his passion, because 'he washed us from our sins in his blood' (Rev 1:5). And he communicated this so that sins might be removed through a ministry, which is completed by the strength of Christ's blood. Hence the Sacraments have strength from the strength of Christ's passion. Hence I will give to you a ministry."
