[^1]: The candle represents the light of Christ (John 1:1-5), as well as the lamp that burned evening to morning before the Lord in the tabernacle (Ex. 27:20-21). The use of the [Sign of the Cross](/meditations/the-history-of-the-sign-of-the-cross) traces back to as early as the 3rd century. Beginning in silent prayer serves to prepare your heart and mind for worship.
[^2]: The reading of the Opening Sentence in the Introductory Rites of [Evensong](/liturgy/rites/daily-office-bcp/evensong) was prescribed in the [*Book of Common Prayer*](https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/the-book-of-common-prayer-1662.pdf) (1662), p. 18, and a selection of Opening Sentences can be found in the *<Definition lang="english" anchor="saint-dunstans-psalter" text="Saint Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter" />* (2002), p. 256.
[^3]: The chanting of the [Deus in adjutorium](/liturgy/music/chants/deus-in-adjutorium) and the [Gloria Patri](/liturgy/music/chants/gloria-patri) at the beginning of [Vespers](/glossary/liturgical-terms#vespers) goes back to at least the 6th century when it was prescribed in the [*Rule of Saint Benedict*](https://www.solesmes.com/sites/default/files/upload/pdf/rule_of_st_benedict.pdf), ch. 18. The English translation comes from the [BCP 1549](https://archive.org/details/bookofcommonpraycs00chur/page/8/mode/2up), p. 8. The BCP 1662, p. 20, added "The Lord's Name be praised" in place of the Alleluia so that the ending could be sung <Definition lang="english" anchor="antiphonal" text="antiphonally" />, and to simplify the rubric, as the Alleluia was permitted only at certain times of the year (see the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 15). The chant tone for the Opening Versicles comes from the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 245. The custom of bowing in reverence to the Holy Trinity at the Gloria Patri is an ancient one. The 16th-century [Roman Missal](https://media.churchmusicassociation.org/pdf/romanmissal_classical.pdf), p. 62, includes it as a rubric for the [Introit](/glossary/liturgical-terms#introit) of the Mass.
[^4]: According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. vi, par. 2, antiphonal psalmody traces back to the Jewish temple, and according to the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 17, the chanting of psalms at Vespers follows the Opening Versicles.
[^5]: <Red text="‡" /> The last seven nights of Advent, the [O Antiphons](/glossary/liturgical-terms#o-antiphons) are added to the Magnificat at Vespers, and likely have been since as early as the 6th century. [Boethius](/people/scholars/boethius) attests to it in his *Consolation of Philosophy* (524 AD). The tone for the Magnificat for the last seven nights of Advent, "Tone II S 1", comes from the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 501.
[^6]: The *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 17, places a Gospel Canticle after the hymn which follows the reading at Vespers. According to the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, pp. 302–303, in 820 AD, Frankish Bishop Amalarius attested to the use of the Magnificat as this canticle. The Sarum Rite has used the Magnificat as this canticle since the 11th century (see the [Sarum Rite rubrics for Vespers](https://sarum-chant.ca/resources/anatomy-of-the-sarum-liturgy/vespers/)). The tone for the Magnificat, "Tone VIII S 1", comes from the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, pp. 506–507.
[^7]: <Red text="‡" /> According to the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="liber-usualis" text="Liber Usualis" />* (1961), pp. 271–272, the antiphon [Salva nos Domine](/liturgy/music/chants/salva-nos-domine) is added to the Nunc dimittis on Lord's Days.
[^8]: The 4th-century [*Apostolic Constitutions*](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/07157.htm), 7.5, includes the Nunc dimittis as an evening prayer. The Sarum Rite has included the Nunc dimittis after the hymn which follows the reading at Compline since the 11th century (see the [Sarum Rite rubrics for Compline](https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/16031/147/NPA-11%20Psalter%20Compline.pdf), p. 442). The tone for the Nunc dimittis, "Tone II A 5", comes from the *Saint Dunstan's Psalter*, p. 502.
[^9]: The *Rule of Saint Benedict*, ch. 17, ends Vespers with the [Kyrie](/liturgy/music/chants/kyrie) and the Our Father. The BCP 1662, pp. 21-23, ends Evensong with the Apostles' Creed, [Salutation](/glossary/liturgical-terms#salutation), Kyrie, Our Father, [Suffrages](/glossary/liturgical-terms#suffrages), Collect, and the Grace. The Sarum Rite places the Benedicamus at the end of Vespers (see the aforementined rubrics for Vespers). The three here have been harmonized for private devotion.
