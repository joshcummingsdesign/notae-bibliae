## Introductory Prayers

### Opening Sentence

<Poetry>
|  Give thanks unto the Lord,
|      call upon his Name,
|      make known his deeds among the people.
|  Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice:
|      and let men say among the nations,
|          the Lord reigneth.
</Poetry>

### Exhortation

Dearly beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us in sundry places, to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by his infinite goodness and mercy. And although we ought, at all times, humbly to acknowledge our sins before God; yet ought we most chiefly so to do, when we assemble and meet together to render thanks for the great benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, to hear his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore I pray and beseech you, as many as are here present, to accompany me with a pure heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace, saying –

Let us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.

### General Confession

Almighty and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; And we have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are penitent; According to thy promises declared unto mankind in Jesus Christ our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

### Collect

<Poetry>
|  Grant, we beseech thee, mer_ciful Lord,
|      to thy faithful people pardon and _ peace; *
|          that they may be cleansed from all their sins,
|      and serve thee with a quiet _ mind; *
|          through _ Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
</Poetry>
