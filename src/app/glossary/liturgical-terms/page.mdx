## Liturgy of the Hours

The Liturgy of the Hours, also known as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="officium" text="Divine Office" /> or *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="opus-dei" text="Opus Dei" />*, is a daily prayer liturgy at regular intervals known as the canonical hours. It marks the hours of each day and sanctifies the day with prayer.

Judaism had three times of daily prayer. The early church was known to pray the Psalms, which have remained a part of the canonical hours. In the 1st century, the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="didakhe" text="Didache" />—the first example of church orders—recommends disciples pray the Lord's Prayer three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. By the second and third centuries, such Church Fathers as [Clement of Alexandria](/people/scholars/clement-of-alexandria), [Origen](/people/scholars/origen), and [Tertullian](/people/scholars/tertullian) wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at Terce (the third hour), Sext (the sixth hour), and None (the ninth hour).

[*The Rule of Saint Benedict*](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia)—drawing from the [Apostolic Fathers](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers), [Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers), and [St. John Cassian](/people/saints/early/john-cassian)—gives a detailed description of the Divine Office as eight canonical hours: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. This Benedict associated with Psalm 119:164, "Seven times a day I praise you", and Psalm 119:62, "At midnight I rise to praise you."

## Mass

The Mass is the central liturgical service of the Eucharist in the Catholic Church. Mass comes from the Latin word *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="missio" text="missio" />*, which means "a sending", as the Catholic liturgy concludes with the sending forth of the faithful, so that they may fulfill God's will in their daily lives.

## Matins

The first canonical hour in the Liturgy of the Hours. From the Latin *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="matutinus" text="matutinus" />* which means "morning", as it is a liturgy of morning prayer (before dawn). It is also called the Office of Readings—because it emphasizes Scripture reading and reflection—or <Definition lang="latin" anchor="vigilia" text="Vigil" />. It occurs in the nighttime or early in the morning before dawn after one has fully rested, in the 8th hour of the night, or about 2 a.m. Traditionally, whatever time was left after the office was to be used for study.

## Nocturne

A <Definition lang="latin" anchor="nocturnus" text="nocturne" /> is a collection of psalms and readings said in the nighttime at Matins.

## None

A canonical hour in the Liturgy of the Hours. From the Latin *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="nona" text="nona" />*, which refers to the ninth hour of daylight. It occurs at the ninth hour, at around 3 p.m.

## O Antiphons

The O Antiphons are a series of plainchant antiphons dating back to the 6th century. [Boethius](/people/scholars/boethius) refers to the text in *The Consolation of Philosophy*, which was published in 524 AD. As the name implies, each antiphon begins with the exclamation "O", and is sung immediately before the [Magnificat](/liturgy/music/chants/magnificat) each of the last seven nights of Advent at Vespers. They are a magnificent theology that uses ancient biblical imagery drawn from the messianic hopes of the Old Testament to proclaim the coming of Christ as the fulfillment not only of Old Testament hopes, but of present ones as well.
