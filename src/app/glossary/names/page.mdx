## Cleopas

The name Alphaeus comes from the Hebrew name *Heleph* (חֵלֶף, “to change”), which may also be pronounced Cheleph. With the Greek termination it written as either Alphaeus, Cleopas (Luke 24:18), or Clopas (John 19:25).

## James

The name James is derived from the name Jacob, who became Israel (Gen. 32:28). In Hebrew, the name יַעֲקֹב (*Yaʿăqōḇ*) means "he who takes by the heel" or "supplanter" (Gen. 25:26). The Greek transliteration of this name is Ἰάκωβος (*Iákōbos*). The "os" was added to make the name masculine. In Latin, however, it was perfectly fine to translaterate the name as Iacob. The Germanic version is Jacob ("J" is pronounced like "Y"). Thus, in English it became Jacob. The Latinized version of the Greek is Iacobus. The Germanic version is Jacoumus. In French, it became Jammes. Thus, in English it became James.

## Judah

The Hebrew name יְהוּדָה (*Y’hudá*) means “praise”. The Greek transliteration is Ἰούδας (Ioúdas). The “as” was added to make it masculine. The Latinized version is Iudas. In English it is Judas, but is also transliterated as Judah. The short form is Jude.

## Thaddaeus

Thaddaeus (Greek: Θαδδαῖος, *Thaddaîos*) comes from the Aramaic word תדי (*Taddai*) meaning “heart”. The Latinized version of his name is Thaddaeus, which is the same name we use in English.
