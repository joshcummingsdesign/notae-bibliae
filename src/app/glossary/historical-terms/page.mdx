## Arianism

A heretical view which holds that Jesus Christ is not coeternal with the Father, but was created by God before anything else. Named after its proponent Arius, a priest in Alexandria.

## Council of Nicaea

The first ecumenical council of the Church in 325 AD, in which the [Nicene Creed](/liturgy/creeds/nicene-creed)—Christianity's defining statement of belief—was drawn up. The term "Nicene Faith" corresponds to this council, and namely its affirmation of the Holy Trinity.
