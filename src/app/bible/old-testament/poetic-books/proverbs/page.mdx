## Synopsis

Proverbs (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="mishlei" text="Mishlei" />*) is a book linked to, but not exclusively written by Solomon, the father of Israel's wisdom tradition. It is a guide for living wisely—in the fear of the Lord—in his good world, using the accumulated insight of his people through the generations.

## 1. The Beginning of Knowledge

This section sets the stage for the book by introducing the goal of the book, "To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight, to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity," and the motto that underlies every instruction, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction." It then moves to a father's invitation to his son to seek wisdom, saying, "If sinners entice you, do not consent." He explains that the wicked will try and encourage others to join them, often with material pursuits, but that a wise person will turn away from them because the wicked will ultimately set a trap for their own lives. He says, "For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird, but these men lie in wait for their own blood." The final part of the chapter personifies wisdom as a woman who calls fools to heed her words, and warns them of the consequences of not doing so. She explains that when calamity strikes as a result of refusing to listen to wisdom, she will not be found. She says, "They shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices." She explains, "The simple are killed by their turning way, and the complacency of fools destroys them." She contrasts this with those who heed her words, saying, "Whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."

## 2. The Value of Wisdom

The father continues by defining wisdom for his son, and highlighting the good that wisdom does for God's children, and the perils that come with not heeding God's wisdom. He says about wisdom, "Seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity; guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints." He says that God gives wisdom to the upright to protect them and watch over them, and that in walking in accordance with God's wisdom, we will be delivered from the ways of evil. He warns his son of being flattered into unfaithfulness, and uses an example of the adulteress who uses "smooth words", but forsakes God and her home and takes others down with her. He says, "None who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life." Lastly, he explains that because of wisdom, we will "walk in the way of good and keep to the paths of righteousness," and that "the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it." He contrasts this with the wicked who will be cut off from the land and "rooted out of it." (Implication: God gives wisdom to protect his kids, and in using it, we will walk away from evil and find abundant peace.)

## 3. Trust in the Lord with All Your Heart

The father urges his son not to forget his teaching, and says wisdom will lead to abundant peace. He says, "Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart." He says this will lead to success in the eyes of God and man. He says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not learn on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord, and turn away from evil. It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones." He says, "My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline or be weary of his reproof, for the Lord reproves him who he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights." He says that wisdom is more precious than silver, gold, and jewels, and that nothing can compare to her. He says, "Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor." He compares her to the tree of life, and says, "Those who hold her fast are called blessed." He explains that in his wisdom, God created the heavens and earth, and that keeping this wisdom will protect his path, give him peace and rest without fear, and allow him to navigate trouble when it arises because the Lord will be his confidence. He urges him to not withhold goodness from his neighbor, to be peaceful, and to not envy the wicked. He says that God blesses the house of the righteous, saying, "Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor. The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace."

## 4. A Father's Wise Instruction

In this section, the father asserts that wisdom is a tradition worth maintaining, that there is a choice between entering the way of wisdom and the way of folly, and that choosing wisdom will give you a fullness of life. The father acknowledges that he too was once young and was told by his parents to seek wisdom and insight, and that in doing so, would receive honor and protection. He says, "The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight." The implication being that the first step in getting wisdom is to seek it, and that it is an invaluable gift from the Lord. He tells his son by choosing wisdom, he will not stumble, and will receive light unlike the wicked who make for themselves a deep darkness. He says, "Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life." He urges his son to "put away crooked speech" and "devious talk", to keep his eyes "directly forward", and to "ponder the path of [his] feet". He ends with, "Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil."

## 5. Warning Against Adultery

The father warns his son of the adulteress who is alluring but deadly, urging him to confine his sexuality to his wife and hold fast to her. He says, "The lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol; she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it…Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house, lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless." He says, "Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well. Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? Let them be for yourself alone, and not for the strangers with you. Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth." He says his wife is the one in whom he should delight and in whose love he should be intoxicated. He says, "A man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord." He contrasts holding fast to one's wife and being intoxicated in her love with being held fast in the cords of one's sin and being intoxicated in evil (led astray).

## 6a. Practical Warnings

The father warns the son about agreeing to pay someone's debt if they default on a loan. He calls this being "snared in the words of your mouth" and coming "into the hands of your neighbor." He says the solution is to focus all your energy on getting out and to plead with your neighbor urgently. Next he warns about the effects of laziness by comparing the ant and the sluggard. The ant works hard to prepare and gather food in the warm seasons, whereas the sluggard falls into excessive rest. He says, "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man." Then he says that those who devise evil and sow discord will suddenly be thrown into calamity and be broken beyond healing. Finally, he lists six or seven things that the Lord hates: pride, lying, violence, plotting evil, following evil, bearing false witness, and sowing discord among brothers.

## 6b. Warnings Against Adultery

The father warns his son about the "smooth tongue of the adulteress," saying, "Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes; for the price of a prostitute is a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life." He continues, "Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?" He says a man who commits adultery will pay sevenfold and ultimately destroy himself with no chance of forgiveness from the woman's husband.

## 7. Warnings Against the Adulteress

The father tells his son to keep his teaching as the apple of his eye. He says, "Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister,' and call insight your intimate friend." He warns his son of the adulteress with her smooth words. He tells a story of seeing a young man lacking sense who sneaks off into the night with a scantily clad married woman whose husband is away. He says, "She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home; now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait." He describes how she seduces the man, and how he gives in and follows her like "an ox that goes to slaughter," saying, "He does not know that it will cost him his life." He says, "Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths, for many a victim she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death."

## 8. The Blessings of Wisdom

The father says, "Does not wisdom call? Does not understanding raise her voice?" Wisdom cries, "To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the children of man. O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense." She says, "Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold, for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her." She says, "I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me." She says, "The Lord possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old." She explains how before God created the heavens and the earth, she was beside him "like a master workman". She says, "I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always, rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man." She says those who listen to her will be blessed, saying, "Whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord, but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death."

## 9. They Way of Wisdom

The father describes how wisdom builds her house with seven pillars, prepares a feast, sets her table, and sends out her young women to call from the highest places in town, "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here…Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight." He says, "Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury. Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight." He says, "If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it." He describes folly as a woman who also calls from her house and in the highest places in town, "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here…Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant." He says, "But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol."

## The Proverbs of Solomon

## 10. The Blessing of the Lord Makes Rich

This section begins the "proverbs proper". The first cluster describes how the righteous understand that it is the Lord who provides and delivers them, so they work diligently in a manner that is upright and blameless before the Lord, whereas the wicked work in a manner that is wicked and/or lazy, which ultimately does not profit them materially or spiritually. The next cluster describes how neither the blessings on the head of the righteous nor the violence that is concealed by the mouth of the wicked are obvious to the casual observer, but that the steps of the righteous and those who follow the righteous are protected, whereas the wicked and those who follow the wicked will ultimately come to ruin. The next cluster describes how the wise lead with love, life, knowledge, and openness which leads to material and spiritual success, whereas the wicked lead with hatred, lies, foolishness, and defensiveness which may lead to material gain, but ultimately leads to spiritual ruin. This implies that what you pursue and how you pursue it is more important than what you possess. The next cluster describes how the wicked may do a lot of talking, which is of little worth and is harmful to themselves and others, whereas the righteous may not talk much, but when they say something, it is invaluable to themselves and others. The verse in the center of the section says, "The blessing of the Lord makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it." This implies that one is truly wealthy when they act righteously and maintain a hope that rests not in material wealth, but in the Lord who provides, and when he provides, he does so freely and with joy. The next cluster describes how the righteous take pleasure in wisdom and are led to a place of stability and security, whereas the wicked are delighted by sin, but end up dreading the path they create for themselves which leads to death (physical or spiritual). The next verse describes how a lazy person is irritating and unreliable to those around him. The next cluster describes how the way of the Lord is a stronghold which makes for a long and joyful life and keeps the wicked at bay. The last cluster describes how the wicked only know what is perverse, which ultimately destroys them, whereas the righteous know what is acceptable and share their wisdom with others.

## 11. One Gives Freely Yet Grows All the Richer

The first cluster describes how a false balance (i.e. falsifying a transaction) is an abomination to the Lord. It says that the prideful get disgrace, self-destruction, and slavery of the heart, whereas the humble get wisdom, guidance, and deliverance. It describes how when you die, your riches, wealth, and pursuit of wealth will do you no good, and that righteousness delivers from death. It says, "The righteous is delivered from trouble, and the wicked walks into it instead." The next cluster describes how when the righteous prevail, all rejoice, but when the wicked prevail, neighbors are destroyed, cities are overthrown, and no one rejoices until the wicked perish. Those with understanding hold their judgment, whereas a fool is quick to belittle his neighbor. The next verse implies that people need guidance and good counsel. The verse after that explains that agreeing to pay someone's debt if they default on a loan is ill-advised. The next cluster describes how although the wicked may prosper materially, the Lord will not let them go unpunished, and they will ultimately not truly live. The righteous also reap what they sow, and they and their offspring will be delivered. An attractive woman without discretion is like "a gold ring in a pig's snout". The final cluster explains how those who withhold what they have only for themselves and trust only in their riches will ultimately lack and fall, whereas the righteous person who gives freely will ultimately flourish and be enriched. Those who seek evil will find it, and will ultimately be repaid on earth. The righteous will also be repaid on earth, and are like a tree of life, helping those around them flourish.

## 12. The Tongue of the Wise Brings Healing

The first cluster describes how he who loves discipline and reproof and seeks favor in the eyes of the Lord will be wise, good, and have a firm foundation. The wicked will have the opposite fate. A wife who is true to her husband will uplift him, whereas one who brings shame will bring him low. The righteous person's fairness and honesty will build them a solid house in the spiritual sense, but the wicked who lie hurt themselves and others and are ultimately brought to destruction. People respect and honor those with good sense, whereas the wicked are despised. The next cluster explains that the wise man will tend to his land and be kind to his animals and servants which will give him plenty of bread. The wicked man is full of pride, cruel, and follows worthless pursuits. The next cluster describes how the wicked are trapped by their own words and live in a state of lack where they covet the riches of other wicked men. The righteous are set free by the truth they speak. They escape from trouble, flourish, and enjoy the abundance God provides for them. Ultimately the work that we do comes back to us, for better or for worse. The wise listen to advice, where fools do what is right in their own eyes. The foolish person is quick to anger and lets their anger be known to others immediately in confrontation. The person may then lie or say something hurtful without thinking, which is an abomination to the Lord, creates more trouble for themselves and others, and promotes folly. The wise person is patient, ignores insult, gives honest evidence, and responds in a manner that brings healing. This is the Lord's delight, and it leads to a life full of peace and joy. The final cluster describes how a diligent and righteous man will lead himself and others to a life of abundance and light, where a lazy and wicked man will be beholden to others, full of anxiety, and will lead himself and others astray to the path of destruction.

## 13. The Soul of the Diligent is Richly Supplied

The first cluster describes how a wise person listens to his father's instruction, speaks goodness into the world, is careful with his words, and is diligent. This ultimately protects him and makes him materially and spiritually wealthy. The fate of the wicked is the reverse. The next cluster describes the paradox of material wealth. One can pretend to be rich or poor. One can have wealth, but live in the fear of others who threaten him, whereas the poor have nothing to lose. This implies that material wealth is not the measure of one's character. The next cluster describes how the righteous man seeks wisdom, sows light, gives hope, reveres the Word, wins favor, acts with knowledge, heeds reproof, brings healing, and is thus honored. The fool "flaunts his folly" and condemns those who don't follow his foolish ways, but will ultimately destroy himself and others. It says, "Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it." It says, "Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm." It says, "Disaster pursues sinners." The final cluster states that a good man will have an effect on his family that will carry on through his kids and grandkids, and that he sees the potential within his kids and nurtures it by teaching them what is just, and disciplining them when necessary. This will ultimately allow them to receive God's abundant provision.

## 14. In the Multitude of People is the Glory of a King

The first cluster describes how a wise woman will build up her house, but a foolish one will tear it down with her folly. The righteous fear the Lord where the fool despises him. Fools create their own suffering. The next verse says, "Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean, but abundant crops come by the strength of the ox." In other words, if you have no ox, you won't have any unpleasant work to do to keep them, but you also won't have the abundant crops that come with them. Truthful witnesses are faithful, and can even save lives. Those who scoff seek knowledge in vain, where knowledge comes easily to those who are understanding. It is advised to walk away from a fool, for no knowledge is found there. The next cluster describes how wisdom leads you, and folly deceives you. It says, "Fools mock at the guilt offering, but the upright enjoy acceptance." It describes how both the heart's bitterness and joy are not known to the outsider, but the upright of heart will flourish while the wicked are destroyed. It says, "There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death." The wicked may have good moments, but they will ultimately slide back into grief and bad habits that lead them to reap what they sow. The wise give thought to their actions, whereas the simple believe everything they hear. The next cluster describes how a wise man turns away from evil, whereas a fool is impulsive, reckless, careless, quick to anger, and ultimately hated. In the next cluster, the prudent man is described as a king, who is well-liked, faithful, and generous to the poor. The fool bows to the king, and his folly only brings about more folly. The next cluster describes how in the Lord we have confidence, life, and protection for us and our children. The last cluster describes how the glory of a king is in his servants, but if a prince has no servants, he is ruined. So too is the prince of the wicked, whose servants' paths lead to self-destruction. Those who are slow to anger reflect God's character, so it is foolish to have a hasty temper. The Lord gives honor to the man who is generous to the needy. Even in the midst of fools, wisdom makes herself known. Righteousness brings a nation high, whereas sin brings it low. The section ends with. "A servant who deals wisely has the king's favor, but his wrath falls on one who acts shamefully."

## 15. The Fear of the Lord is Instruction in Wisdom

The first cluster describes how God sees all, the good and the evil, and how the righteous listen to reproof and are very careful with their words, which leads to less contention, more wisdom, and can be life-giving to the speaker and listener. The wicked do just the opposite. The Lord accepts the sacrifices of the righteous, whereas the wicked receive severe discipline. It says, "Better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble with it. Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a fattened ox and hatred with it." The next cluster describes how a hot temper stirs up strife, and how laziness creates a path that is like walking through a hedge of thorns. It says, "Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed." Giving good counsel brings joy to all involved. The Lord will humble the proud, and protect the needy. Wicked thoughts and unjust gain brings trouble to man's life and home. It is better to think before you speak lest your mouth cause more harm than good. The Lord hears the prayers of the righteous. Those who listen to reproof gain wisdom. It ends with, "The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom, and humility comes before honor."

## 16. The Answer of the Tongue is from the Lord

The first cluster begins with, "The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord…Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established." God has a purpose for all things. The arrogant will not go unpunished, and the humble will receive atonement by God's grace. The righteous will have peace, even from their enemies. It says, "Better to have little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice." It ends with, "The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps." The next cluster describes how the throne of a king is established by justice and righteousness, which come from the Lord. It is wise to obey such a king, whose mission is to lead his people to peace and abundance. The next cluster describes how wisdom and humility are better than material riches because pride leads you to destruction. The next cluster describes how those who give thought to the Word and trust in God will discover good and be blessed. It says, "The wise of heart is called discerning, and sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness." Gracious words are life-giving, and are refreshing to the soul. The last cluster describes how the wicked do what's right in their own eyes, lead their neighbors astray, and sow discord. It says, "Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is gained in a righteous life." It describes how one who is slow to anger and rules his spirit is mightier than one who captures a city. It ends repeating the idea from the beginning of the section saying, "The lot is cast into the lap, but every decision is from the Lord."

## 17. The Lord Tests Hearts

The first cluster describes how it is better to have little with peace in the home, than a lot with strife. It says, "A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers." This means that someone born in a lower status can rise up through diligence and hard work, and one who is foolish can be brought low even if they are born with a higher status. The Lord tests hearts through adversity. The wicked spread lies and mock the poor. It says, "Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of children is their fathers." It says, "Fine speech is not becoming to a fool; still less is false speech to a prince." It warns of the temptations of bribery. The next cluster describes how the righteous seek love and forgiveness, and when they receive forgiveness look to repent and to not repeat their past mistakes. This is what maintains close friendships. It says, "A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred blows into a fool." It is better to be righteous and in danger, than safe as a fool. It is an abomination to the Lord to side with the wicked. Wisdom cannot be bought or sold. Bonds between friends grow deeper through adversity. Being a good friend doesn't mean going along with their foolish ways, e.g. cosigning on a loan when they don't have the funds to pay it. It says, "The discerning sets his face toward wisdom, but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth." The last cluster describes how the foolish bring shame and heartache to their parents, how it is wrong to punish someone for being upright, and how restraining your words and having a "cool spirit" puts you on the path of righteousness.

## 18. Wisdom is a Babbling Brook

The first cluster describes that one who isolates himself seeks selfish gain, ignoring the sound judgment of the wise. It says, "A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, only in expressing his opinion." Our words can go in many directions and even into darkness like deep waters, but wisdom brings us to a pleasant and refreshing place like a babbling brook. The next cluster encourages us to be careful with our words. Our words can create injustice, violence, and can even trap us. When chosen carefully, they can deeply affect us and our listeners. The next cluster implies that while wealth can give us a false sense of security, God is our true security. Laziness and pride are both destructive. It says, "If one gives an answer before he hears, it is his folly and shame." It says that we can bear sickness, but not a crushed spirit. The next cluster begins with, "The one who states his case first seems right, until the other comes and examines him". It continues, "A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city, and quarreling is like the bars of a castle." The last cluster describes how words can bring death or life, and those who choose life will reap many rewards. It is good for a man to find a wife, and when doing so, he obtains favor from the Lord. Even at a man's worst, there will be one who sticks by him closer than a brother.

## 19. The Fear of the Lord Leads to Life

The first cluster describes how although wealth brings many new friends, and the poor are often deserted, it is better to be poor with integrity than rich and foolish. When we hastily make decisions without seeking wisdom, we can head down the wrong path. The path that leads to foolishness and ruin can make one resent the Lord. The next cluster describes how lying will trap you and will not go unpunished, but one who is generous and understanding will discover good and live with peace in his heart. The next cluster begins with, "It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury, much less for a slave to rule over princes." It continues, "Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense." A king's anger and favor are both powerful and thus must be used wisely. While a house and wealth can be gained materially, a prudent wife is a gift from God. A lazy person is always too tired to work, but they will go hungry. The next cluster advises the wise to listen to instruction, be kind to the poor, be involved in your children's lives and discipline them, avoid friendships with those who lack self-control, acknowledge the rule of God, and understand that love and integrity are what bring real happiness. It says, "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand…The fear of the Lord leads to life, and whoever has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm." The last cluster describes how rebuking a scoffer can have a positive effect on the simple who listen on, and how if a person is wise, they will gain knowledge from a rebuke. When you stop listening, you miss or stray away from knowledge. Honor your mother and father, be just, and be humble.

## 20. The Spirit of Man is the Lamp of the Lord

The first cluster describes how it is unwise to be led astray by drunkenness. It warns of the terror of an angry king. The wise stay away from quarreling. The wise plow in the autumn so they can enjoy the fruit of their labor at harvest time. The next cluster describes how a man's purpose is buried in his heart, and if he is wise, he will bring it forth. Many claim they are faithful, but a faithful person is hard to find. The family of the righteous will be blessed through the generations. The next cluster describes how a king should use fair and impartial judgment to curb evil, how our own sin should make us forbearing in judging others, that even children make their character known through their actions, and that the Lord is the final judge. The next cluster describes how people have a tendency to say something is bad to negotiate a better price, but then brag when they walk away with it. Knowledge is more precious than gold and costly stones. It is best to be wary of those who foolishly put up security for a stranger. It says, "Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel." The next cluster describes how plans are established by counsel, and how loose lips sink ships. Cursing your mother and father leads to darkness. A young, foolish person will squander their inheritance. The next cluster begins with, "Do not say, 'I will repay evil'; wait for the Lord, and he will deliver you." It goes on to describe how our steps are directed by the Lord, and our will should be with him lest we do what is right in our own eyes. It is unwise to make rash vows. A wise king rules over sin, leads with steadfast love and faithfulness, and thus reflects God's character. It says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all his innermost parts." When we are young, we feel our strength is our greatest asset, but as we age, we see it is our wisdom.

## 21. Victory Belongs to the Lord

The first cluster states that a king's heart is guided by the Lord, that what a man does is right in his own eyes, but the Lord will judge him for his actions, that righteousness and justice are more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice, and that pride is the lamp of the wicked. Diligent plans lead to success while hasty ones lead to failure. Don't quarrel with your wife or make her fret, or you'll be sleeping on the rooftop or in the desert. Also don't be antagonistic yourself and don't be ruled by fear in your marriage. The next cluster describes how the greedy and scoffer will have no mercy from others or from God, but when one is punished they gain knowledge when they listen. Bribes may create a temporary solution, but lead to long-lasting suffering due to injustice. The next cluster describes how pursuing injustice and mere pleasure and material gain, and wandering away from good sense will lead to one's own demise. In a sense this makes them a ransom for the righteous, i.e. their death frees others from the suffering they cause. The wise earn wealth, while the poor squander it. Those who seek righteousness will find it. Wisdom can overcome might. The sluggard lives in a state of lack and want, but does not work for it, whereas the diligent works and gives freely yet has abundance. The wicked make sacrifices in vain, especially when their intent is not repentance. The wicked rush into things with pride, but the wise give thought to their actions. It ends with, "The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the Lord."

## 22a. Thorns and Snares are in the Way of the Crooked

Your legacy is more valuable than your material wealth. The rich and the poor are all God's children. The wise turn away from danger, and the simple do not and suffer. The humble and the pious get protection, blessings, honor, and life. The greedy and unjust will ultimately fail and come to poverty, whereas the generous who sees abundance gives freely and will be blessed. Don't put up with scoffers, they only lead to strife, quarreling, and abuse. It says, "He who loves purity of heart, and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend." It says, "The sluggard says, 'There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets!" This implies that the lazy go to great lengths to avoid work, but will be destroyed by the reality of poverty. Lust leads to suffering and makes the Lord turn away from us. Children need guidance and discipline, which will have a lasting effect on them, and will give them the tools they need to live wisely.

## 22b. Thirty Sayings of the Wise

The section begins with an introduction to the 30 sayings of the wise, which urges the reader to listen and apply the knowledge, asserts the knowledge will help them know what is right and true, and encourages the fear of the Lord.

1. Don't rob the poor or crush the afflicted. The Lord protects the needy.
2. Don't befriend bitter people lest you end up like them and entangle yourself.
3. Don't put up security for debts lest you lose the bed you sleep on.
4. Moving your neighbor's landmark is effectively stealing their land.
5. Don't be careless about the quality of your work. Skillful work wins the respect even of kings.

## 24b. Justice and Economy

Impartial judgment leads to blessing, and injustice leads to being abhorred and cursed. One should commit to speaking honestly. One should refrain from bearing false witness, even when one is angry or wants revenge. One should make the proper preparations before starting on one's work. The end of the verse explains how the proverbs are to work. A man passes by the field of a sluggard and sees that it is overgrown with thorns and has a broken wall, and remembers, "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man."

## 25. A Man Without Self-Control is Like a City Broken Into and Left Without Walls

Although the king's heart is hidden, and his role is to search things out and govern with wisdom, he is ultimately subordinate to God who has the power to conceal things. A king should choose their advisers carefully, based on their moral character. It is better to humbly be called into the king's presence and be honored than to presumptuously enter it and be put low. Peacefully work things out with your neighbor instead of running to others. Wisdom shared at the proper time is valuable and refreshing. Don't boast of gifts yet give nothing. Be diplomatic and tactful. Patience and humility have a more powerful impact than arrogance and forcefulness. Don't eat in excess. Don't wear out your welcome. Don't lie, be untrustworthy, or be insensitive (whistling past the graveyard). Be kind even to your enemies, as the Lord will bring them to repentance. Speaking ill of someone, especially when they're not in your presence, causes damage and anger. It says, "Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country." It says, "Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked." Seeking glory is not glorious. It ends with, "A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls."

## 26. Honor is Not Fitting for a Fool

Honor is not fitting for a fool. A curse that is causeless is like a bird that never lands because God gives no heed to it but rather protects the righteous. Fools need discipline. Correct a fool lest they be right in their own eyes, but don't become a fool yourself in the pursuit. It says, "Like one who binds the stone in the sling is one who gives honor to a fool." A foolish person who judges is ultimately referring to himself. It is harmful to yourself and others to hire a foolish person. It is unwise to repeat your past mistakes. It says, "Do you see a man who is right in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him." The sluggard looks for ways to avoid work, but will ultimately go hungry. It is foolish to meddle in quarrels not your own. It is foolish to deceive your neighbor. It says, "For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisper, quarreling ceases." A quarrelsome man adds fuel to the fire. Gossip is tempting, but has negative consequences. Like the glaze on an earthen vessel, one may lie to cover up an evil heart. One who lies to cover up his evil will ultimately be exposed and entrapped in his own web of deceit. It says, "Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling." Lying and flattery has negative consequences for you and those around you.

## 27. A Man Is Tested by His Praise

Be humble, don't brag about a day that has yet to arrive, and don't praise yourself. Jealousy and provocation put a weight on one's heart and the hearts of others. It is better to be openly rebuked by a friend, than to have an enemy pretend to love you. It says, "One who is full loathes honey, but to one who is hungry everything bitter is sweet." Don't stray from your home. A good friend gives you earnest counsel. Don't run to your brother's house on the day of your calamity. The fool rushes into danger, consigns a loan for a stranger or immoral woman, and lets friendliness turn into obnoxiousness. One should be cautious about quarreling with his wife or entering into a quarrelsome marriage, as changing someone is like restraining the wind or grasping oil in your hand. It says, "Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another." If you work hard, you will eat the fruit of your labor. A man's heart reflects his being. The enemy is never satisfied, and neither are the foolish. A man's humility is tested by praise. A fool will not depart from his foolish ways, even when he is crushed. The wise attend to their herds and their flocks because they understand that wealth is fleeting and it does not last forever. By being good stewards of what they have, they will have food and clothing for their household.

## 28. The One Who Trusts in the Lord Will Be Enriched

The section opens with, "The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion." The first cluster describes how a land under righteous leadership will have stability and social order, whereas a land ruled by the wicked will be oppressed. It says, "Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways." The righteous are generous to the poor. It says, "If one turns away from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination." It describes how the poor who have understanding will expose the rich who are wise in their own eyes. The cluster ends with, "When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, people hide themselves." The next cluster says, "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy. Blessed is the one who fears the Lord always, but whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity." A lasting ruler is one who rules justly. Following worthless pursuits leads to poverty. It says, "A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished." It says, "To show partiality is not good, but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong." Rebuke is more honorable than flattery. It says, "A greedy man stirs up strife, but the one who trusts in the Lord will be enriched." It says, "Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered." Blessings come to those who give freely and generously. It ends with, "When the wicked rise, people hide themselves, but when they perish, the righteous increase."

## 29. By Justice a King Builds Up the Land

The section opens with, "He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck, will suddenly be broken beyond healing." People rejoice when their leaders are righteous. There are two paths a man can take, the path of wisdom, which makes his family proud, and the path of sin, which squanders all wealth. A just king builds up the land and does not demand gifts. It says, "An evil man is ensnared in his transgression, but a righteous man sings and rejoices." The righteous understand the rights of the poor. Scoffers add fuel to the fire, but the wise douse the flame. Arguing with a fool who does not listen is a worthless pursuit. The fool speaks loudly and seeks praise, the wise is quiet and humble. A corrupt system is built upon falsehoods. It says, "The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both." A king's throne is established in justice. A child left to himself without discipline will bring shame to his family. If you give your child discipline, they will bring you great joy. People need hope for the future. It says, "Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him." Anger, wrath, and strife lead to sin. It says, "One's pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor." Following the wicked, or standing by and doing nothing leads to one's own suffering. It ends with, "The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe. Many seek the face of a ruler, but it is from the Lord that a man gets justice. An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, but one whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked."

## 30. The Words of Agur

The title of this section says, "The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle." It is unclear who he was as he appears nowhere else in the Bible. It is apparent, however, that he is someone well-versed in the wisdom tradition of Solomon. The first cluster describes how man cannot fully understand all the works of God, but how God's Word is true, and that man should humble himself before God and not add or take away from his Word. He says, "Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and be found a liar." The next cluster is a prayer for deliverance from lies, and that one has enough to not be poor, but not so much that he becomes too proud. He says, "Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, lest I be full and deny you and say, 'Who is the Lord?' or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God." The next verse is a warning against slander. The next cluster describes those who do not honor their mother and father, those who are too proud to confess their sin, and those who are greedy and "devour the poor". The next cluster describes those who want and want and can never be satisfied, likening their insatiable desire to Sheol whose fire never says, "Enough." The next verse is a curse to those who dishonor their parents. The next cluster describes how like an eagle in the sky, a serpent on a rock, or a ship on the sea, the way of a virgin is not known, but that the way of the adulteress is known, yet she covers it up and pretends to have done no wrong. The next cluster describes the insufferable person who takes a position they are not qualified to hold. The next cluster describes the ants who gather their food for the summer, the rock badgers who take care to build their homes, the locusts who have no king yet work together to achieve a task, and the lizards who are small and humble yet make their way to dwell with kings. The next cluster describes how a king's majesty is not in himself, but in his subjects. The last cluster describes how it is best for the foolish who devise evil to remain quiet lest they become embroiled in conflict.

## 31. The Words of King Lemuel

The title of this section says, "The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him." Like Agur, it is unclear who he was, but he exemplifies how all rulers are called by wisdom to rule justly. This section has two parts, the first describes the archetype of the noble king, and the second describes the archetype of the positive feminine. The king does not let his judgment be clouded by lust or drunkenness, but rather protects the rights of his subjects, particularly the poor and the needy. He even celebrates with them from time to time to let them forget their misery. The next section begins with, "An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels." It describes how her husband trusts in her and together they have abundance. She is strong, and works tirelessly to provide for her family. She is generous and kind. She doesn't fear the snow, but rather bundles her family up in the winter. Her husband is known at the gates of the city. It says, "Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come. She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue." Her children and her husband bless her. It ends with "Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Give to her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates."
