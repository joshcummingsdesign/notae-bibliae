## Synopsis

<Definition lang="greek" anchor="ekklesiastes" text="Ecclesiastes"/> (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="kohelet" text="Kohelet"/>*) is the story of a teacher who explores the enigma of life, the phenomenon that everything is fleeting, and the issues that come along with pursuing meaning and purpose apart from God.

## 1a. All Is Vanity

In the title of the section, the Hebrew word *"<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hevel" text="hevel"/>"* is translated as "vanity". *"Hevel"* could also mean "mist", "vapor", "fleeting", or "elusive". The book begins with the narrator quoting the words of a "Preacher" who is described as a Davidic king in Jerusalem. The Preacher says, "Vanity of vanities…All is vanity. What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun? A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever." He describes how the natural world goes in cycles like seasons, and man perceives there to be nothing new, like everything that could be done has been done already. Just as things in the natural world come and go, people in the world come and go, and very few make a significant impact.

## 1b. The Vanity of Wisdom

The Preacher describes the anxious toil that has been his pursuit of wisdom, which he describes as "striving after wind". He says even after all this striving, there are still things beyond our comprehension, things that God does not reveal to us. He says, "For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases in knowledge increases in sorrow."

## 2a. The Vanity of Self-Indulgence

The Preacher goes on to describe how he turned his life over to pleasure and self-indulgence. He drank wine, built houses, planted vineyards, made gardens and parks, and acquired great wealth. He considered this a reward for all his toil. He then realized that this too was striving after wind. He says, "There was nothing to be gained under the sun."

## 2b. The Vanity of Living Wisely

The Preacher goes on to explain how he saw that there was more to be gained in living a life of wisdom than of folly, but how he realized that both the wise and the fool die and are forgotten. This made him despair as he realized that the pursuit of living wisely is also fleeting.

## 2c. The Vanity of Toil

The Preacher goes on to describe how he realized that even in all his toil and accumulation of wealth through the pursuit of wisdom, he will have to leave all his wealth to someone else when he dies. Worse than that, the person he may have to leave his wealth to may himself be a fool. He despairingly says, "What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun? For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This is also vanity." He then makes a profound observation; that there is nothing better for man to do than to receive the joy that God gives us in our toil. To receive his gifts of food, drink, wisdom, knowledge, and joy. These are the gifts he gives to the one who pleases him, but to the sinner he gives a life full of empty toil.

## 3a. A Time for Everything

A short poem which opens with, "For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven." For example, "a time to be born, and a time to die," and, "a time for war, and a time for peace."

## 3b. The God-Given Task

The Preacher describes how he has seen all the work that God has given to man, and how though all things are fleeting, God has made everything beautiful in its time. He notices how God gave us the ability to understand that there is eternity, i.e. things that came before us and things that live on long after us, while simultaneously limiting our ability to understand it all. He explains that the best that man can do is to do good so he may receive God's gifts: joy, food, drink, and enjoyment in one's work. He points out that in a world full of *hevel*, the work of God endures forever. Nothing can be added to it, and taken away from it. This gives us our sense of humble reverence and awe of God.

## 3c. From Dust to Dust

The Preacher points out that even in God's just world there is human wickedness, and that though God will bring justice, it may be that man is being tested to show that they are but beasts, and both man and beast return to the dust in the end. Because life is fleeting in this way, he argues that the best man can do is rejoice in his works, for that is his portion in life.

## 4. Evil Under the Sun

The Preacher reflects on all of the oppression and misery he's seen at the hands of man. He notices man's striving as a result of envying his neighbor. He notices the self-destructive nature of laziness. He comments on humility by saying, "Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind." He notices the lone person who endlessly strives after wealth, but is never satisfied, and notices the blessings that come with working together. He recounts that during the time of an old foolish king, a poor wise youth ascends to the throne and leads his people, and how even he is forgotten in the end.

## 5. Fear God

The Preacher says, "Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools." He advises to not be hasty and unintentional with your words, and to not make rash vows. He says, "It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay." He again comments on humility and reverence for God and his blessings saying, "When dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; but God is the one you must fear." He says be not surprised of injustice in a land, for it is at the hand of a king only committed to cultivated fields. He says that those who love their wealth will never be satisfied. He says, "When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep." He tells the story of a man who had a family and worked away his life to earn wealth only to lose it in a bad venture. He says, "What gain is there to him who toils for the wind?" He repeats the sentiment that the best we can do is eat, drink, and find enjoyment in our works, and be thankful for what we have, for that is our portion from God. He ends with, "For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart."

## 6. Find Contentment

The Preacher describes the darkness that comes with a man who has many blessings from God, but is never satisfied with them. He describes this as worse than death. He says, "Better is the sight of the of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite." He describes how it is foolish for man to dispute God's ordering of the world, and that doing so only produces more words and more vanity. He describes man's inability to define what is good for himself as his life is fleeting, and no one knows what tomorrow will bring. The implication being that only God, who has named all things, knows what is truly good.

## 7. The Contrast of Wisdom and Folly

The Preacher begins by saying, "A good name is better than precious ointment." He continues describing how it is important for us to mourn and bereave as it shows more wisdom and maturity than feasting and mirth. He says, "It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools." Blackmail and bribery corrupt the heart. Be patient and not proud. Be slow to anger. Don't feel like "the good ol' days" are better than the days now, this is foolish. Though wisdom can't give you eternal life, it can protect your steps while you are living. Fear God, as he withholds knowledge even from the wise. Receive joy when it comes, for adversity will also come, God gives man both. Don't be one who believes he is always right, constantly judging others. At the same time, don't be foolish. The wise show compassion to both types of men. Wisdom brings strength. The wise understand that no one is free of sin. Don't take to heart the things that people say of you, and remember the times you have said things about other people. The Preacher explains that he has dedicated his life to pursuing wisdom, but is far from achieving it. One who pleases God escapes the sinful woman, but the sinner is taken by her. In his pursuit of wisdom, the Preacher explains that he still cannot fully comprehend the actions of man. He ends by saying, "God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes."

## 8. Man Cannot Know God's Ways

The section opens with a short poem about how wisdom is not common, and when someone has it, it makes them stand out. The Preacher then explains that while one should respect the Lord's anointed, one should wisely stand up to injustice and not do evil if the king commands it. Regarding standing up to injustice, he says, "The wise heart will know the proper time, and the just way." He says, "No man has power to retain the spirit, or power over the day of death." He then explains that although there are times when the wicked seemingly prosper, the blameless should not despair, as God will judge them in the end. It is best that the blameless receive his joy, as this is God's gift to man. He ends by stating that although a man can endlessly pursue knowledge, and claim to know all that is under the sun, we ourselves are not God, and cannot understand the things that have not been revealed to us no matter how hard we try.

## 9. Death Comes to All

The Preacher describes how the wicked and the righteous both die in the end, but that it is better to choose life, with all its uncertainties, over death, because when one dies, they are unable to partake in the beauty the living get to enjoy. He says, "He who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten." Thus we should enjoy our life and all the gifts that God gives us, as that is our portion. He ends by describing how folly can be detrimental to ourselves and others, and how wisdom can overcome even the mighty. He explains that it is better to be wise, even if it doesn't come with glory, than to be a fool who tarnishes the good in God's world. He says, "The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools."

## 10. Proverbs Concerning Wisdom and Foolishness

The Preacher begins saying that a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. He says that calmness will lay great offenses to rest. He describes how he has seen foolish kings, and wise paupers. He says those who dig a pit will fall into it. He describes how the foolish will have to work harder, and how the wise work efficiently. He describes how the wise gain respect, while the fool is consumed by his words. He describes how a fool multiplies his words about matters he is unsure of, i.e. what will happen after him. He says the land will mourn a foolish king, and praise a noble one. Laziness will cause more trouble than good, and working hard will allow you to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Be careful what you say (and think), because news travels fast.

## 11. Cast Your Bread Upon the Waters

The section opens with, "Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days." One interpretation of this is that you should give freely as God will provide. The Preacher explains that it is wise to diversify your efforts as you don't know what will happen to any one of them tomorrow. He says, "He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap." In other words, too much regard for the "weather" or external situations will cause you to not take action. Be humble, because no one truly knows all the works of God, i.e. the spirit. One should enjoy life and all the gifts life has to offer, but should not forget death comes to us all, and that God will judge us all. It ends with a reminder not to be bitter and not to dwell on pain because youth is fleeting.

## 12. Remember Your Creator in Your Youth

In the final section, the Preacher urges the reader to remember the Creator in the days of his youth, before his eyes are dimmed, he is hard of hearing, he is weak, he has too few teeth to enjoy food, he is afraid, his zeal is low, his youth pours out like water, his body returns to the earth, and his spirit returns to God who gave it. "Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity." The book concludes with a final message from the narrator. He says, "The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; they are given by one Shepherd." In other words, wisdom guides us on the proper path, it is lasting, and it is ultimately given by God. He says,"My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of flesh." In other words there is no end to the pursuit of knowledge, and one can wear himself out trying to gain all the knowledge he can, but true wisdom comes from God. The book concludes with, "The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil."
