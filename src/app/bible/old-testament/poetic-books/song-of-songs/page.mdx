## Synopsis

Song of Songs, which is a Hebrew idiom meaning "The Greatest Song", is also called "Song of Solomon". It consists of eight chapters of poetry, which was likely not written by Solomon, but was written in the wisdom tradition of Solomon. It paints a picture of man and woman's love before the fall, where they were naked, unafraid, and completely unified.

## 1. The Bride Confesses Her Love

The book opens with a woman confessing her love to a man, and he responds lovingly in return. She says, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine." A chorus responds, "We will rejoice in you. We will extol your love more than wine." She continues by expressing how she is unrefined and has spent her life working in the vineyard under the hot sun, but that this makes her lovely, powerful, and beautiful like the tents of Kedar and the curtains of Solomon. She says the man is who her soul loves, and she asks him where he pastures his flock and lies down at noon so they can meet. The man responds calling her "most beautiful among women", and tells her where she can find him. He compares her to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots. The chorus responds, "We will make for you ornaments of gold, studded with silver." She responds with a poetic description of his beauty, and compares the outdoor scenery to a beautiful house for them.

## 2. The Bride Adores Her Beloved

This section begins with, "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys." Sharon is a coastal plain in the west of Israel (near modern Tel-Aviv). The man compares the woman to "a lily among brambles." She compares him to "an apple tree among the trees of the forest." She says, "He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love." She says she is "sick with love", and urges the daughters of Jerusalem not to "stir up or awaken love until it pleases", i.e. not to rush things before they are ready and to take their time. She describes the man bounding over the hills like a gazelle, inviting her to come his way during the springtime when love is in the air. She says, "Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom." She says, "My beloved is mine, and I am his."

## 3. The Bride's Dream

The woman describes a dream in which she goes about the city to find her love. She finds him, embraces him, brings him to her mother's house, and they go into her room where they can be alone. She again urges the daughters of Jerusalem not to awaken love until it pleases. It then switches to a scene where "Solomon" is being carried to the location of his wedding by 60 mighty men. She tells the daughters of Jerusalem to look upon him and his crown on the day of the gladness of his heart.

## 4. Solomon Admires His Bride's Beauty

The man poetically describes and admires his bride's unparalleled beauty, comparing it to a locked garden with the choicest fruit and spices and a sealed fountain with the freshest of water (living water). He ends with, "Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden and let its spices flow." She responds with, "Let my beloved come to his garden, and eat its choicest fruits."

## 5. The Bride Searches for Her Beloved

The man accepts the woman's invitation to love her fully. The chorus responds with, "Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!" The bride has a dream where the man is knocking at her door, ready to consummate the marriage, but when she answers he is gone. The dream turns into a nightmare when she is taken by the watchmen of the city and beaten and bruised. She says, "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am sick with love." The chorus asks her what sets her man apart, and she responds with a beautiful and poetic description of his physical appearance. She ends with, "This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."

## 6. Together in the Garden of Love

The chorus asks where the woman's beloved had gone. She explains that he has gone down to the garden to graze and gather lilies, insinuating that they have committed themselves to each other. The man poetically describes her beauty, and even describes her as "awesome as an army with banners," and "beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun." He says, "Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me." The woman reciprocates and goes to the garden to see all that is blooming, and finds her prince. The chorus tells her to return so they may look upon her. The man protects her and doesn't let her go.

## 7. The Bride Gives Her Love

The man's desire grows as he showers her with poetry about her beauty and his physical attraction to her. He makes his move saying, "Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters. I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit." She responds saying that she is her beloved's, and his desire is for her. She says that she is ready, and compares her love to the time when the garden has fully blossomed saying, "Beside our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved."

## 8. Longing for Her Beloved

The woman longs for his kiss and his embrace, and once again reminds the daughter of Jerusalem not to awaken love until it pleases. She then says, "Under the apple tree I awakened you," implying that the couple has consummated their marriage. She then says, "Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. Its flashes are the flashes of fire, the very flame of the Lord. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised." The chorus (now likely her brothers) asks her what they can do for her now that she's married, as in the past they had protected her. The woman responds that she waited until the time was right, and now has contentment with her one true love. She goes on to describe how Solomon had a vineyard that he let out to keepers, and that they were to bring him a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit; i.e. Solomon spent extravagantly to maintain his harem. She says, "My vineyard, my very own, is before me; you, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred;" i.e. her love is not for sale, it is to be given freely to her one true love. The man calls to the women whose friends are listening for her voice, and desires to be the one to hear it. She responds, "Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices."
