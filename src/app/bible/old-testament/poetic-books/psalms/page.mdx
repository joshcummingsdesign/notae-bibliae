## Introduction

* * *

## 1. The Way of the Righteous and the Wicked

The first psalm introduces the entire book by singing of the blessings that come with walking in accordance with God's law, and the physical and spiritual perils that the wicked face when they turn away from righteousness and God's Word. It introduces the idea that there are really only two ways to live. It begins with, "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but delight in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night." It compares the pious to a flourishing tree, and the wicked to "chaff that the wind drives away." It says, "The wicked will not stand in the judgment," which could be any judgment, or the final judgment, but could also imply that sinners don't care to be judged and turn away from God. It ends with, "The Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish." Note: "knows" here may mean "looks affectionately upon."

## 2. The Reign of the Lord's Anointed

A royal psalm that reminds its singers that God anointed David and his descendants as kings to fulfill the Abrahamic promise. It begins by depicting kings of enemy nations, who are "against the Lord and against his Anointed," and who are looking to revolt and overthrow the king of Israel. It displays confidence that the Lord sees their rebellion, will discipline them, and will establish his king in Zion. The king recalls his coronation, how the Lord told him, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you," and how he will fulfill the Abrahamic promise through the king. It ends with a blessing to those who take refuge in the Lord and in the Son, and a curse to those who rule with pride.

## 3. Save Me, O My God

A psalm of David when he fled from his son Absalom. It begins with, "O Lord, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me; many are saying of my soul, 'There is no salvation for him in God." He continues, "But You, O Lord, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. I cried aloud to the Lord, and he answered me from his holy hill." He describes how despite all the enemies that surround him, God continues to sustain him each morning he wakes, and so he will not be afraid. He prays for salvation from the God who delivers us from the wicked. It ends with, "Salvation belongs to the Lord; Your blessing be on Your people."

## 4. Answer Me When I Call

A psalm of David displaying quiet trust amid troubling circumstances. It begins with, "Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!" It lamens man's vanity and dishonor, but puts trust in God who answers the prayers of the godly. It says to "be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your own beds, and be silent." It reminds us to "offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the Lord." He expresses how the Lord gives him more joy than any material possession could ever provide saying, "You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound." It ends with, "In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety."

## 5. Lead Me in Your Righteousness

A psalm of David describing how evil tarnishes God's house and drives us away from him, and how he will lead those who come to him with humility and reverence in his righteousness. It begins with, "Give ear to my words, O Lord; consider my groaning. Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray. O Lord, in the morning You hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for You and watch." David says that God is his king. He continues, "For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you." He says, "But I, through the abundance of Your steadfast love, will enter Your house." He prays, "Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me." He then prays that the wicked and prideful who will not repent and rebel against God will bear their guilt and fall by their own counsels. It ends with hope that the pious will take refuge in God and rejoice saying, "For you bless the righteous, O Lord; you cover him with favor as with a shield."

## 6. O Lord, Deliver My Life

A penitential psalm. David's lament, often included in the Penitential Psalms, in which David prays for God's grace and mercy during a time of crisis. He says, "Rebuke me not in your anger…Be gracious to me O Lord, for I am languishing." He prays, "Turn, O Lord, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love." It ends with confidence the Lord hears his prayer, and that he will be delivered from his enemies.

## 7. In You Do I Take Refuge

David's song to the Lord concerning the words of Cush, a Benjaminite (the tribe of Saul who was pursuing David during their conflict). It begins with a cry for safety saying, "O Lord my God, in you do I take refuge. Save me from all my pursuers and deliver me." It is a plea of innocence. It calls for God to arise as a righteous judge to save the upright in heart. It describes the Lord's anger toward those who threaten the faithful, and calls the wicked to repent saying sinners will fall into a hole they dug themselves. The implication is that we should pray our enemies turn to God rather than pray they suffer punishment. It ends by giving thanks to the Lord the Most High because his righteousness and justice will prevail.

## 8. How Majestic Is Your Name

David's hymn of praise celebrating God's created order, and man's special place in it. It begins with, "O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!" It praises God for giving his faithful the strength to "still the enemy." It asks, "What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?" It continues, "[You have] crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet."

## 9. I Will Recount Your Wonderful Deeds

Psalms 9 and 10 are from David, and are in a mostly acrostic pattern (following most of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet). Psalm 10 doesn't have a title, so it could be seen as a continuation of Psalm 9, but it has somewhat of a different theme, so it could also be seen as a separate psalm. Psalm 9 begins, "I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart." It praises the Most High for his "wonderful deeds." It sings of how God maintained the singer's just cause and judged his enemies with righteous judgment. It sings of how God destroyed the enemy, how he is a stronghold for the oppressed in times of trouble, and how he has not forsaken those who seek him. It prays for God's grace and deliverance so one may recount all his praises. It sings of how the enemy fell into their own net that they hid, while hope for the poor and needy lives on. It ends with a prayer that the enemy will see that they are but men.

## 10. Why Do You Hide Yourself?

David's lament (and possibly continuation of Psalm 9) in which the wicked (or faithless) pursue the poor (or faithful). It begins by asking why God stands far away when the wicked pursue the poor out of arrogance and greed and renounce the Lord. It sings, "The wicked boasts of the desires of his soul." It continues, "In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, 'There is no God.'" It then describes how although God is out of sight and the wicked feel as if they are unseen, he is judging from up high. It goes on to say that while God is noting the actions of the wicked, the helpless are committing themselves to him. It calls God "the helper of the fatherless". It ends with acknowledging the Lord as King, and prays he will do justice so they wicked can strike terror no more.

## 11. The Lord Is in His Holy Temple

David's song which expresses the confidence the faithful may have in a time of severe crisis. When the wicked seek to do harm, one finds oneself fleeing and taking refuge in the Lord. The first part of the psalm asks what a righteous person can do when the pillars of justice are destroyed and the unfaithful have free rein. The second part of the psalm provides the answer. God rules all things. He loves and tests the righteous (danger is an opportunity to prove your faith), and punishes and hates the wicked (those who do harm are liable to God's judgment).

## 12. The Faithful Have Vanished

David's psalm for a time where it seems like all the faithful are gone and wickedness and lies prevail, though we know God is sovereign over all. It begins with, "Save, O Lord, for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man. Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak." It prays God will put an end to the "flattering lips" of man who speaks with "great boasts." It describes such people as, "those who say, 'With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?'" It describes them as people who put their own grandiose and flattering words before God. It contrasts the words of man with the Word of God, and describes his word as the purest silver. It ends with faith that God will protect the poor and the needy even when wickedness is exalted throughout the land.

## 13. How Long, O Lord?

David's psalm. A lament for a time that we feel far from God and it seems our enemies prevail, though we know God is always with us and prevails every time. It begins with, "How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?" David expresses great sorrow, and cries out for a nearness with God, one that it seems even too hard to remember. He asks, "How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?" He asks, "Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; light up my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death." David doesn't want to feel a spiritual death, but wants a closeness to God like he has experienced in the past. He prays God will answer him. It ends by David remembering all the prayers God has already answered, and all the love and faithfulness he has already shown, saying, "But I have trusted your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me."

## 14. The Fool Says, There Is No God

David's psalm. A community lament, mourning the fact that those who do not seek God treat God's people cruelly. It begins with, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.' They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds." It reminds the faithful that even when threatened, God is our refuge. It ends by praying that God, from his sanctuary, will deliver and restore God's people so that all the land can be glad and rejoice.

## 15. Who Shall Dwell on Your Holy Hill?

David's psalm which encapsulates the ideals at which the Israelites should aim when serving the Lord in Jerusalem. It begins with, "O Lord, who shall sojourn in Your tent? Who shall dwell on Your holy hill? He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks the truth in his heart." These ideals include being kind to your neighbor, showing compassion, despising evil and loving the Lord, keeping your promises, telling the truth, not charging interest or taking bribes. This person "shall never be moved." God will ensure his stability.

## 16. You Will Not Abandon My Soul

David's song of trust and confidence in the Lord, that he is our portion, wisdom, guidance, and source of joy. It says, "The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot. The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed I have a beautiful inheritance." It blesses the Lord who gives counsel, and says that putting God first leads to a fullness of heart and rejoicing. It expresses confidence that the Lord will not abandon the souls of the faithful. It ends with, "You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore."

## 17. In the Shadow of Your Wings

David's prayer for vindication. It begins with a call for God to hear a just cause so that the righteous may be vindicated. It describes how he has directed his life towards following God's Word, and has avoided the transgression that comes with following the works of man. It prays that God will show his steadfast love to those who seek refuge in him. He prays, "Keep me as the apple of your eye, hide me in the shadow of your wings, from the wicked who do me violence, my deadly enemies surround me." He poetically describes the dangers of evil that surround him. He calls to the Lord to confront and subdue these evil men, whose only portion in life are the material treasures of the here and now. It ends with a statement of faith that he will behold God's face in righteousness and awake with his likeness (for that is his portion).

## 18. The Lord Is My Rock and My Fortress

A psalm of David to the Lord after he delivered him from his enemies and Saul. It begins with, "I love you, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer." It praises God, who saved David in his darkest moments when he called upon him. It recounts God's awesome power in the face of the enemy, and how God saves the righteous. David expresses how he kept the Lord's statutes and kept himself from guilt, and how the Lord rewarded him according to his righteousness. It says, "The Lord my God lightens my darkness." It speaks of how the Lord will strengthen us to do what he asks of us. It says, "This God—his way is perfect; the Word of the Lord proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him." It praises God for strengthening David to defeat the enemy, while saying, "Your gentleness made me great." He acknowledges that it is the Lord who makes him great, who made him head of the nations, and who brought those who felt lost before him to find strength. It closes by saying he will praise him among the nations and sing his name, and says, "Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever."

## 19. The Law of the Lord Is Perfect

A psalm of David in which God's people celebrate his law as his supreme revelation of himself, and humbly respond by reflecting on their own moral failures while looking to God for forgiveness and protection from sin. It says, "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge." Regarding his words it says, "In them he has set a tent for the sun, which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy." It says the laws of the Lord are perfect, invaluable, and rewarding to those who keep them. It asks, "Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults. Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me!" It prays the Lord hears the prayer and that one may be acceptable in his sight.

## 20. Trust in the Name of the Lord Our God

A royal psalm from David which prays God will grant the king success in battle, recognizing that salvation comes from him. It begins with, "May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob protect you! May he send you help from the sanctuary and give you support from Zion!" It prays God will "grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans." It displays trust that the Lord saves his anointed, and that Israel's salvation comes from God and not their army, saying, "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God." It ends with, "O Lord, save the king! May he answer us when we call."

## 21. The King Rejoices in the Lord's Strength

A royal psalm from David giving thanks to God for answering his prayer in Psalm 20. It begins with, "O Lord in your strength the king rejoices, and in your salvation how greatly he exults! You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips." It praises God for blessing him, making him king, and giving him life and salvation. It speaks of how the king finds joy in God and trusts in him, saying, "You make [the king] glad with the joy of your presence. For the king trusts in the Lord, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved." The psalm ends with confidence the Lord will seek out the wicked, and praise to the Lord for his strength and power.

## 22. Why Have You Forsaken Me?

A prophetic psalm of David. A lament in which he expresses great suffering and the feeling that God has all but abandoned him, yet confidence that the Lord will vindicate him so that he may praise him among the congregation and ultimately all nations throughout the generations. It begins with, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" He expresses great sorrow in the midst of his trial, to the point he feels as if God has forsaken him. It continues, "Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel. In you our fathers trusted, and you delivered them." Despite his trial and anguish, he remembers how God delivered his people. Despite this history, he describes how the people mock and ridicule him in the midst of his great suffering, and say to him, "He trusts in the Lord; let him deliver him." Despite this he remembers how the Lord has been faithful to him since birth and prays, "Be not far from me, for trouble is near, and there is none to help." He further describes the pain of his trial and how his enemies surround him, but remembers how God has answered his past prayers and says, "But you, O Lord, do not be far off! O you my help, come quickly to my aid! Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog! Save me from the mouth of the lion!" He then goes on to say that when he is vindicated he will go on to glorify the Lord's name before the great congregation and ultimately all nations saying, "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord." It ends with, "It shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation; they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn, that he has done it."

## 23. The Lord Is My Shepherd

David's psalm of confidence in the Lord's care. It begins with "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me to paths of righteousness for his name's sake." It goes on to say, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me." It ends describing how God shows his grace and mercy even in the presence of enemies, and how this grace and mercy will follow one forever in the house of the Lord.

## 24. The King of Glory

David's psalm, perhaps from the time he brought the ark of the Lord into Jerusalem, which asserts the idea that the God who created and owns everything is the very same God into whose presence the faithful worshiper enters because of the covenant with Israel. It says, "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof…Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false and does not swear deceitfully. He will receive blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation." It ends with a call and response where the gatekeepers are called to open the gates of Jerusalem for the King of glory and they ask, "Who is the King of glory?" The congregation responds with, "The Lord, strong and mighty."

## 25. Teach Me Your Paths

A penitential psalm. An acrostic psalm by David which prays for wisdom, forgiveness, protection, and redemption. It begins with, "To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul. O my God, in you I trust; let me not be put to shame." It prays, "Let me know your ways, O Lord; teach me your paths. Lead me in your truth and teach me." It prays for God's mercy and steadfast love and says, "Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions." It praises God for his justice, faithfulness, and steadfast love. It acknowledges God as the Savior saying, "My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he will pluck my feet out of the net." It prays for grace saying, "Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted." It prays for forgiveness. It prays for deliverance from enemies and says, "May integrity and uprightness preserve me." It ends with a prayer for all Israel saying, "Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles."

## 26. I Will Bless the Lord

A psalm of David which praises the Lord and prays to be faithful to him. It begins with, "Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the Lord without wavering." David prays that should the Lord test him, he shall see his faithfulness, that the Lord's steadfast love is before his eyes, that he has kept away from the assembly of the wicked, and that he has proclaimed thanksgiving in the name of the Lord and has told of his deeds. It displays the love of the house of the Lord, and prays he will not be swept away with sinners. It ends with, "I shall walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me. My foot stands on level ground; in the great assembly I will bless the Lord."

## 27. The Lord Is My Light and My Salvation

David's song about cultivating confidence in the Lord in order to handle the toughest of life's circumstances. It begins with "The Lord is my light and salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" It describes how God calls us to be confident in his love through difficult times, and how the one thing we should ask of him is to be in his family so that we may meditate on his Word. His love allows us to lift up our heads in tough times and sing with joy rather than turn away with anger. The Lord will take you in when others reject you. It calls for God to direct our steps. We must wait on the Lord and be strong and courageous.

## 28. The Lord Is My Strength and My Shield

A psalm of David praying God answer him and not let him be dragged down with the wicked, and remembering that the Lord is his shield. It begins with, "To you, O Lord, I call; my rock, be not deaf to me, lest, if you be silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit." David truly prays the Lord will answer him in his time of trouble, though he has faith because he knows God will protect him and turn him away from the wicked. He says, "Do not drag me off with the wicked, with the workers of evil, who speak peace with their neighbors while evil is in their hearts." David knows that evil is not only in man's action, but can be in his heart and influence his actions. He prays God does to the wicked according to their deeds and build them up no more. It ends with David remembering and honoring the steadfast love and faithfulness of the Lord saying, "The Lord is the strength of his people; he is the saving refuge of his anointed. Oh, save your people and bless your heritage! Be their shepherd and carry them forever."

## 29. Ascribe to the Lord Glory

David's hymn which calls to ascribe glory to the Lord for his majesty and power, and prays for strength and peace for God's people. It begins with, "Ascribe to the Lord, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength." It describes the voice of the Lord as full of power and majesty which breaks cedars, makes lightning strike, shakes the wilderness, and brings forth life. It sings that beyond all great powers of the world is the Lord. It ends with, "May the Lord give strength to his people! May the Lord bless his people with peace!" Through the storm, God gives us strength and peace.

## 30. Joy Comes with the Morning

David's song for the dedication of the temple, which took place after he died. He is a song of thanksgiving for God's deliverance over the course of his life. It begins with, "I will extol you, O Lord, for you have drawn me up and have not let my foes rejoice over me. O Lord my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me. O Lord, you have brought up my soul from Sheol; you restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit." It continues, "Sing praises to the Lord, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name. For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning." He describes how although God blessed him with prosperity, there is no profit in a death (physical or spiritual) without God, so he prays for God's mercy. He describes how God turns our situations around so we can praise his name and give thanks to him forever.

## 31. Into Your Hand I Commit My Spirit

David's song which is a lament that seeks help from God for a faithful person worn out with trouble and beset by enemies who want to do him harm. It begins by acknowledging God as our refuge, and praying for salvation. He sings, "Into your hand I commit my spirit," expressing trust that God will vindicate the innocent sufferer. Jesus uses these words on the cross. It calls for us to rejoice in his steadfast love because he sees our affliction. It expresses trust in the Lord amidst the present dangers we face (this trust comes from personal experience and by remembering God's covenant with his people). David says, "My strength fails because of my iniquity," (this could be a lament about how his lie caused the priests to die). It calls for God to judge the wicked, and praises God for his abundant goodness, which he stores up for the righteous (those who trust him). It recounts how David was shown this love when he was in a besieged city. It ends with a call to love the Lord, to be courageous, and to wait for the Lord.

## 32. Blessed Are the Forgiven

A penitential psalm of David about confession and forgiveness. It begins with, "Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit." It addresses the pain and suffering that comes with carrying our sin around with us, and how the pious bring their sins before the Lord because they trust in his mercy. It prays that the pious turn to God and pray for their sins, as he will deliver us. He says, "Be not like a horse or mule, without understanding, which must be curbed with bit and bridle, or it will not stay near you." It ends with, "Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the Lord. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, O righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!"

## 33. The Steadfast Love of the Lord

A hymn which praises the Lord who created the heavens and earth for his steadfast love, power, protection and faithfulness. It begins with, "Shout for joy in the Lord, O you righteous. Praise befits the upright. Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre." It says, "He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the Lord." It praises God as the Creator, and prays all will stand in awe of him and be blessed through the family of Israel. It sings of God's awesome power over even kings saying, "The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength. The war horse is a false hope for salvation, and by its great might it cannot rescue." It describes how God will love and protect those who fear and trust him, and describes the Lord as our help and our shield. It ends with, "Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in you."

## 34. Taste and See That the Lord is Good

David's psalm, written when he pretended to be mad before the king of Gath, Achish (described here as Abimelech), and was sent away. It begins by a commitment to bless the Lord at all times, and calls for the congregation to exalt his name together. It recounts how the Lord answered David when he turned to him when he was fearful, and describes how the Lord answers and delivers the righteous to seek him. David says, "Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed." It calls us to "taste and see that the Lord is good." Those who seek the Lord will never lack. It calls us to do good and seek peace. The Lord delivers the righteous from affliction, and the wicked will be slain by it. It ends by saying, "None of those who take refuge in him will be condemned." (The righteous and the wicked will both have trouble, but the righteous are promised a different ending.)

## 35. Great Is the Lord

David's prayer for God to fight on behalf of the faithful when the malicious seek to do them harm. It begins by saying, "Contend, O Lord, with those who contend with me." He says, "Say to my soul, 'I am your salvation.'" he prays that the wicked who look to do him harm will be dishonored, and will fall into their own nets and holes that they set out for the righteous, ones they created with no just cause. When the Lord vindicates him, his soul will rejoice and he will exalt his salvation. He describes how he prayed and mourned for the people when they were sick, but now they mock him and rejoice at his misery. He calls to the Lord to rescue him. He says, "Let not those rejoice over me who are wrongfully my foes, and let not those wink the eye who hate me without cause. For they do not speak peace, but against those who are quiet in the land they devise words of deceit." It ends with a prayer that when he is vindicated, others will see how God vindicates the righteous, and will rejoice in his name.

## 36. How Precious Is Your Steadfast Love

David's psalm reflecting on the wicked who oppose the faithful, and the steadfast love of the Lord. It begins with, "Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes. For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out or hated." David contrasts how the wicked do not reject evil with the steadfast love and righteousness of the Lord, comparing his faithfulness, righteousness, and judgements to the clouds, the mountains, and the ocean. It highlights how God's love protects us and gives us abundance and light. It prays for this steadfast love to continue to those who know him. It ends with, "Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me, not the hand of the wicked drive me away. There the evildoers lie fallen; they are thrust down, unable to rise."

## 37. He Will Not Forsake his Saints

A wisdom psalm of David in acrostic form that  urges the faithful to remain righteous even when the wicked prosper. It begins with, "Fear not yourself because of evildoers; be not envious of wrongdoers! For they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the green herb. Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness. Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart." It urges the pious to wait on the Lord even when the wicked prosper in their way. It explains that anger and wrath only lead the pious down the path of evil. He explains that in waiting, the pious realize it will only be a little while before the wicked are judged by the Lord, while the righteous dwell in abundant peace. He says, "Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked." He says, "In the days of famine [the righteous] have abundance." He contrasts the greed of the wicked with the generosity of the righteous, and how God will direct the steps of the righteous so that they may be upheld by him and inherit the land forever. David says in his lifetime, he has seen how the righteous and their children have not been forsaken, and how the wicked have been "cut off". He says, "For the Lord loves justice; he will not forsake his saints." It ends with, "The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord; he is their stronghold in the time of trouble. The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him."

## 38. Do Not Forsake Me, O Lord

A penitential psalm of David for the memorial offering. It laments suffering as a result of one's sin, confesses, asks for forgiveness, and prays for salvation. It begins with, "O Lord, rebuke me not in Your anger, nor discipline me in Your wrath! For Your arrows have sunk into me, and Your hand has come down on me." It expresses how his suffering is great, and his sin is over his head, putting a heavy burden on him. He acknowledges the suffering is because of his foolishness, and expresses how sin can make us feel there is nothing to do but lie down defeated. He describes friends who stand aloof from him in his time of suffering, and enemies who seek his life making things worse. In his sin, he feels as though he has no place to rebuke others, so he remains silent. He has faith in God saying, "But for You, O Lord, do I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer." He takes responsibility for his sin, saying, "I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever before me. I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin." It ends with, "Do not forsake me, O Lord! O my God, be not far from me! Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!"

## 39. What Is the Measure of My Days?

A psalm of David which describes great turmoil, prays for God to remind him how fleeting life is so that the turmoil doesn't consume him, and prays that God will deliver him from that turmoil. It begins with a scene in which David is in the presence of the wicked and he is silent, careful not to speak ill, but inside his anger and distress are growing. When he does speak, he prays that God will remind him how fleeting life is, and how living with this turmoil and living to accumulate wealth are empty pursuits. He says the real pursuit is waiting on the Lord. He prays to be delivered from his sins and from the wicked who scorn him. It ends with, "Look away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more!"

## 40. My Help and My Deliverer

A psalm of David giving thanks for the many mercies he has received from God, praying for God's help and mercy in his current state. It begins with, "I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry." It describes how God delivered him and "put a new song in [his] mouth" so that many could see and trust in the Lord. It says, "Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not turn to the proud." He recounts how the Lord's deeds have been so great and so many that they are hard to enumerate. He warns of offering sacrifices without faith, repentance, and obedience saying, "In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required. Then I said, 'Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me: I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart." He continues, saying that he has not withheld his praise of the Lord from the great congregation. He then asks God to deliver him, and that his steadfast love will preserve him and save him from himself and from others, saying, "Evils have encompassed me beyond number; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me." He prays all those who seek him will rejoice in his salvation. It ends with, "As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God!"

## 41. O Lord, Be Gracious to Me

A psalm of David about one who is ill and suffering and finds no comfort from others, but rather animosity. It begins describing how those who consider the poor and the weak are blessed and reflect God's light into the world, just as God blesses us with his grace, expecting nothing in return, as we have nothing to offer him. He says this person will be blessed, protected, delivered from his enemies, and healed from illness. He then turns his attention to his current situation where he is suffering from illness as a result of sin, and how in his distress, people (even his closest friend) scorn him and imagine the worst for him. He prays God will be gracious to him, and is confident that God will not let his enemies prevail over him, saying, "You have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever." It ends the section and the book with a doxology, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen."  Note: Amen comes from the Hebrew word for "truth" or "I believe".

## 42. Why are You Cast Down, O My Soul?

A psalm from the sons of Korah. This psalm expresses the yearning to return to God's presence in the sanctuary during a time of turmoil. It begins with, "As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God." The psalmist describes how during a time of suffering he looks back and remembers how he shouted for joy, praised God, and experienced his presence most fully in the sanctuary. He says, "Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God." The psalmist says in his current state, he remembers God, even though he is far from the sanctuary. He describes God coming over him like a raging sea, and describes how God commands his steadfast love in the morning, and puts a song of prayer within him by night. He asks why God has forgotten him, i.e. why he feels distant and sad in his trial. It ends one more time asking why his soul is cast down, and saying he shall praise him again, for God is our salvation.

## 43. Send Out Your Light and Your Truth

A psalm (probably from the sons of Korah, fits nicely with Psalm 42) which prays for God's vindication against ungodly people. It describes someone in a crisis who seeks refuge in God. It prays God will send his light and truth to lead the psalmist back to the sanctuary so he may be filled with joy and praise his glory. It asks why one's soul is in turmoil, but has faith that God shall be one's salvation.

## 44. Come to Our Help

A hymn from the sons of Korah for God's people who seek his help in a time of suffering at the hands of their enemies. It begins remembering how their fathers told them that God drove out the nations and saved them from oppression. It acknowledges it is God who saves them. It says, "For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me." It continues, "We will give thanks to your name forever." It then asks why they are made to suffer though they have not forgotten God's name or his covenant. It calls for God to rise up, come to their help, and redeem them for the sake of his steadfast love.

## 45. Your Throne, O God, Is Forever

A hymn from the sons of Korah celebrating a royal wedding. It is a love song for a king in the line of David. It begins with, "My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe." It goes on to praise the king for his appearance, gracious speech, military power, and commitment to promoting justice. It continues with, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness; you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions." The song then blesses the bride who is leaving her father's house to be a loyal wife to the king. It describes the beautiful clothes, the procession, and the joy of the wedding in the palace. It ends with a blessing for the king whose sons will cause his name to be remembered throughout the generations.

## 46. God Is Our Fortress

A song from the sons of Korah celebrating God's deliverance, perhaps written in a time where God delivered Israel from invaders, like the time he defeated 185,000 Assyrians in the days of Hezekiah. It begins with, "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling." He contrasts the ragings sea (nations) with a flowing river (God's grace in Zion), "There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved." The psalm reminds us that though nations rage and kingdoms totter, God is ultimately sovereign, and delivers us so his name may be exalted in all the earth. It ends with, "The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress."

## 47. God is King over All the Earth

A psalm from the sons of Korah about God's kinship and rule over creation. It begins with, "Clap your hands all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy!" It sings of how the Lord, the Most High, is king over the earth and will bless all nations through Israel. It ends with, "The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted!"

## 48. Zion, the City of Our God

A song of the sons of Korah, celebrating Zion as God's special city. Fits nicely during the time Hezekiah restored the temple, but could be a celebration of a time where Gentile forces besieged Jerusalem, but came away dismayed. It begins with, "Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain, beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King. Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress." It describes how kings came, possibly to besiege it, but how God threw them into a panic, wrecked the ships of Tarshish, and established his city forever. Israel is encouraged to rejoice in the name of the Lord, who is protected by the steadfast love of God and his judgments. It reminds the singer that although they should consider the material defenses of God's holy city, it is ultimately God who protects them. It ends with, "Tell the next generation that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever"

## 49. Why Should I Fear in Times of Trouble?

A wisdom psalm from the sons of Korah about the perplexity that the pious feel when they encounter suffering, while the unfaithful seem to prosper. It opens with a call for all people, rich and poor alike, to listen to the singer's wisdom and understanding. The puzzle it set up with a question, "Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me, those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?" The response is that everyone's life will end—the rich and the poor, the wise and the foolish—and one's wealth will not save them from death. It outlines the differences the pious and the wicked will face after death, saying that the wicked will have no place to dwell and that, "God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me." It says, "Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases. For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down with him." It ends with a call to strengthen the singer against the temptation either to despair or to give up and join the unfaithful in the pursuit of material wealth and personal glory, saying, "Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish."

## 50. God Himself Is Judge

A psalm of Asaph about God's judgment over his people, especially those who use sacrifice as a sort of bribe to God rather than to show their dependence on him, to glorify him, and to enter into a relationship with him. It begins with, "The Mighty One, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting." It calls all people to attention, and to hear the one who speaks and summons the earth, especially Israel in their privileged position sayin, "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth." It reminds the people that God does not stay silent, but indeed judges his people, especially those who entered a covenant by sacrifice. It then switches to God's perspective where he addresses those who offer sacrifices as a way to buy off God by reminding them that he is not dependent on them, but rather they are dependent on him, saying, "I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds. For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine. If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine." God then directs his people to offer sacrifices of thanksgiving since they glorify God as host, highlight the worshiper's dependence on him, and feed the worshiper, family, and the needy. He highlights how this brings the worshiper deeper into a relationship with God rather than being a way to appease him by saying, "Perform your vows to the Most High, and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me." God then addresses the wicked who hates discipline, is pleased dwelling amid sinners, who slanders his brothers rather than invite them to the table, and mistakes God's mercy and silence as his approval. He makes it very clear they will be judged by saying, "Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver! The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the 'salvation of God!'"

## 51. Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God

A penitential psalm of David when Nathan the prophet went to him after his sin with Bathsheba. It begins with, "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!" He acknowledges his sin as "ever before [him]" and that his sin was ultimately with God, as he is the ultimate judge for all sin and is just and blameless in his judgment. He says, "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me." Instead of distance and self-abasement, David demonstrates a longing for a closeness with God and his wisdom, saying, "Behold, you delight me in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart." He prays that God will cleanse and renew his spirit, saying, "Restore me to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit." He continues saying that when he is restored, he will praise God, and teach others who have sinned of God's mercy, and they will return to him. David implies that the underlying significance of burnt offerings is in the heart of the worshiper who seeks forgiveness, atonement, and healing. It ends with a prayer that there will be healing for all so that right sacrifices may be made in Jerusalem.

## 52. The Steadfast Love of God Endures

David's song, written when Doeg, the Edomite, came and told Saul, "David has come to the house of Ahimelech." It begins with, "Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day." It describes Doeg's (and possibly Saul's) words as a sharp razor, and describes how he loves evil more than good, and lies more than the truth. It describes how God will always find and break down the wicked. David describes how the righteous will look on and say, "See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!" It ends by saying, "I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever. I will thank you forever because you have done it. I will wait for your name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly." Green olive trees are an image of vitality and fruitfulness. God's judgment allows the faithful to wait for God as he will protect those who trust in him, they need not be consumed with thoughts of vengeance.

## 53. There Is None Who Does Good

David's hymn mourning mankind for falling away from God and bringing others down with them. He prays that Israel shall rejoice when God restores the fortunes of all nations. It begins with, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'" It continues, "They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt." Furthermore he says, "Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?" He highlights the self-created fear that comes with turning away from God by saying, and the protection that comes with turning towards him by syaing, "There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you." It ends with, "Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad."

## 54. The Lord Upholds My Life

A song from David when the Ziphites told Saul he was hiding among them. It opens praying that God will save and vindicate him. He says that ruthless men, who put themselves before God, seek his life. It acknowledges God as the savior and upholder of his life. It ends saying he will offer a freewill offering and give thanks to God, that God is good, and that he has delivered him from every trouble.

## 55. Cast Your Burden on the Lord

A psalm of David likely after he was betrayed by his son Absalom and his counselor Ahithophel. It begins with, "Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy." David goes on to describe his dire situation, where the oppression, grudges, and anger of his enemies await him. He says, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest; yes, I would wander far away; I would lodge in the wilderness. I would find a shelter from the raging wind and tempest." He prays the Lord will deliver him from the violence, strife, and lies prevalent in the city. Furthermore, he adds that it is not just an enemy who taunts him, but someone very close to him, a friend, a companion. He has faith that God will redeem him, and will humble those who do not fear him. Regarding his friend he says, "My companion stretched out his hand against his friends; he violated his covenant. His speech was as smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords." David says, "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you." We can bring our pain to him and he will get us through the most trying of times. He ends knowing that eventually the wicked will go down a path of their own destruction, and that God will work out his plan. David trusts in the Lord.

## 56. In God I Trust

David's song when the Philistines seized him at Gath. He calls for God's grace as man looks to trample and oppress him, and against all odds he puts his trust in God. He says he will not be afraid, asking, "What can flesh do to me?" He knows that God has seen his struggle. He vows to give thanks and offerings because the Lord has delivered him from death. God's deliverance allows him to continue to walk in his light.

## 57. Let Your Glory Be over All the Earth

A psalm of David when he fled from Saul. It begins with, "Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge." It describes how he will take refuge in the Lord until the storms of destruction pass by and expresses confidence in God saying, "I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me. He will send from heaven and save me; he will put to shame him who tramples on me. God will send out his steadfast love and his faithfulness." He compares the dangers around him to dwelling in the midst of lions. He prays that God's glory be over all the earth. He describes how the wicked dug a pit for him, but fell into the very pits that they dug. It ends in praise and thanksgiving to the Lord and his steadfast love saying, "Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!"

## 58. God Who Judges the Earth

A psalm of David praying that God execute justice on tyrants. It prays for godly leadership, and displays hope that God will one day vindicate the righteous who will rejoice in his name. It begins with, "Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly?" The phrase "you gods" refers to "mighty lords", chiefs, leaders, or rulers. It then answers the question, "No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth." It describes the unjust rulers as venomous snakes who don't hear the voice of their charmers, i.e. men who do not honor God and keep his commandments. It prays that God won't let tyrants succeed in their efforts saying, "Tear out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord! Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted." It ends with hope and trust that God will vindicate his people, saying, "Mankind will say, 'Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth."

## 59. Deliver Me From My Enemies

A song written in the time when Saul sends watchmen to kill David. The song begins with a plea to God to deliver one from one's enemies who look to do evil when one has done no wrong. The enemies think no one hears them, but God hears all (and even laughs at them). God is our fortress. God will meet us in steadfast love and let the righteous triumph over their enemies. The wicked will be trapped in their pride. The wicked wander about like dogs trying to get their fill, but the righteous sing of the Lord's strength. God is a fortress and a refuge in the day of distress.

## 60. He Will Tread Down Our Foes

A song of David during the time of his victories over Zobah, the Philistines, Edom, Moab and others which was perhaps later used during war time. It begins with, "O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us." It laments and prays for God's salvation. It compares God's judgment to a strong wine saying, "You have given us wine to drink that made us stagger." God answers that he will restore the promised land and defeat the enemy. It ends by reminding the singer that victory doesn't come from man, but from God by saying, "Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man! With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes."

## 61. Lead Me to the Rock

A psalm of David praying that God will show love and faithfulness to the king so that he may be godly, rule with honor, fulfill his vows, and praise his name so that all may be blessed. It begins with, "Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer; from the end of the earth I call you when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy." It expresses confidence that God has heard the king's vows and has appointed him to lead the righteous. It ends with, "Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations! May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him! So will I ever sing praises to Your name, as I perform my vows day after day."

## 62. My Soul Waits for God Alone

A psalm of David which looks to God alone for salvation when attackers look to harm and oppress us, and reminds us that rich or poor, we must fight the tendency to worship material possessions and have anger in our hearts, and look to God who ultimately has power over all things. It begins with, "For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation. He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken." It describes attackers who only look to harm us, who do not look out for our best interest, and even when they bless with their mouths, they inwardly curse. It is for this reason that we should hope and wait on God alone for our salvation. It reminds us to "trust in him at all times" for "God is a refuge for us." It expresses that the lives of the rich and poor are both fleeting, and setting your heart solely on obtaining material possessions is an empty pursuit that can lead to spiritual death. It ends with, "Once God has spoken; twice I have heard this: that power belongs to God, and that to You, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work."

## 63. My Soul Thirsts for You

David's psalm when he was in the wilderness of Judah. It opens with, "O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water." He recalls the days when he could worship in the sanctuary. He says, "Your steadfast love is better than life…So I will bless you long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands." He compares the love of God to being as satisfying as delicious food, and when he meditates and prays he will remember how the Lord has protected him. He is confident those who seek to harm him will get their judgment from God. He says the king shall rejoice in God, and all who swear by him shall rejoice.

## 64. Hide Me from the Wicked

A psalm of David which prays to be delivered from the enemy, and expresses confidence that God is just, and that the wicked ultimately fall on their own sword so that the righteous may rejoice in the Lord. It begins with, "Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy." It describes those who look to do the blameless harm with their words and their actions, who seek injustice in their hearts. It then turns the focus to God and says, "But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly. They are brought to ruin with their own tongues turned against them." It expresses how others will see that God has defeated the enemy and ponder his works. It ends with, "Let the righteous one rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him! Let all the upright in heart exult!"

## 65. O God of Our Salvation

David's psalm giving thanks for a fruitful harvest. It begins with, "Praise is due to you, God, in Zion, and to you shall vows be performed." It gives thanks to the God who atones for sins so that the people may draw near and worship in his temple. It says, "When iniquities prevail against me, you atone for our transgressions. Blessed is the one you choose and bring near, to dwell in your courts!" It gives thanks to God, who by his awesome deeds created the heavens and the earth and gives us hope, saying, "By awesome deeds you answer us with righteousness, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas." It thanks God for enriching the land and providing abundance. It ends with, "The pastures of the wilderness overflow, the hills gird themselves with flocks, the valleys deck themselves with grain, they shout and sing together for joy."

## 66. How Awesome Are Your Deeds

A thanksgiving song to the God who answers prayers. It begins with, "Shout for joy to God, all the earth; sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise! Say to God, 'How awesome are your deeds!'" It recounts how God parted both the Red Sea and the Jordan so that his name could be glorified forever. It says, "Let not the rebellious exalt themselves." It calls all peoples to bless the Lord as he saved Israel and brought them through their trials into a place of abundance. The singer promises to come to the house of the Lord with offerings, and will perform the vows he made to God. The singer gives thanks to God for answering his prayer when he prayed without iniquity in his heart. It ends with, "Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me!"

## 67. Make Your Face Shine upon Us

A song praying that God will bless all nations. It begins with, "May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine upon us, that your way may be known on earth, your saving power among all nations." It prays that all nations come to praise God, who judges with equity. It ends with, "The earth has yielded its increase; God, our God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; let all the ends of the earth fear him!"

## 68. God Shall Scatter his Enemies

David's hymn, possibly from around the time he moved the ark to Jerusalem, about God's protective care over Israel, praising his power and strength. It begins with, "God shall arise, his enemies shall be scattered; and those who hate him shall flee before him…But the righteous shall be glad; they shall exult before God; they shall be jubilant with joy." It recounts how God protected the Isrealites in the wilderness and provided for them. It describes God scattering kings on behalf of his people. He describes how God in all his glory dwells in Jerusalem saying, "Sinai is now in the sanctuary." It says, "Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation," and describes how God delivers his people from their enemies and strikes them down. It describes a procession of Israelites with singers, virgins with tambourines, musicians, and princes of Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun, and Naphtali as they enter the sanctuary to worship. It is confident the sanctuary will turn enemies away from lusting after greed and war, and turn them to God. It ends by calling all nations to sing to God whose majesty is over Israel and who gives power and strength to his people.

## 69. Save Me, O God

David's lament in which he is not only suffering for the wrongs he has done, but finds attackers piling on, taking advantage of his suffering and making it worse. It begins with, "Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck." He explains how he feels as though he is drowning and is becoming weary waiting on God's deliverance. He describes his numerous enemies who wish to harm him without cause, and acknowledges that God sees all his transgressions. He prays that those who hope in God not be put to shame through him and his actions. His enemies even attack his attempts to repent, which are ultimately an attack on God. He turns his attention to his reliance on God and prays for God's salvation in the name of his steadfast love. He expresses his failed attempts to find comfort in man, but only found reproach. He prays that those who look to do him harm and will not repent will suffer God's wrath. He says he will "magnify him with thanksgiving," which will "please the Lord more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs." This will make those who hope in the Lord be glad, as God "hears the needy." It ends praying that all the earth will praise God, that he will save Zion, build up the cities of Judah, let the offspring of his servants inherit it, and let those who love his name dwell in it.

## 70. O Lord, Do Not Delay

A psalm of David for the memorial offering. It prays that God will deliver him from all enemies who seek his life, and it prays that all who seek him will rejoice and glorify his name.

## 71. Forsake me Not When My Strength Is Spent

An individual lament in a time when enemies look to take advantage of someone who is weak or in distress. It begins with, "In you, O Lord, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame…You have given the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress." He prays God rescue him from enemies who pursue him in his weakened state, mistaking his weakness for his God's abandonment. He says his praise will be in his mouth continually, and he will remind them of the deeds of the Lord. He prays God preserve him so that he may tell future generations of God's power, righteousness, and salvation of his people. It ends with, "And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disappointed who sought to do me hurt."

## 72. Give the King Your Justice

A royal psalm of Solomon, although it ends saying "The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended." It prays that the heirs of David;s line might have success in the task that God has assigned the King—leading God's people, protecting the poor and the needy, and bringing blessing to all the nations of the earth. It begins with, "Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the royal son! May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice!" He prays that the righteous flourish and that peace abounds during his reign. He prays that with this justice, he rules over all the land, and all nations come to serve him.

He prays that during his reign, there is abundance, and that all nations will be blessed. It ends with, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things. Blessed be his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and Amen!"

## Book 3

* * *

## 73. God Is My Strength and My Portion Forever

A psalm of Asaph. A wisdom psalm which attempts to address the bitterness the pious may feel when unbelievers seemingly carry on without a care. It begins with, "Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had nearly slipped. For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked." It goes on to describe the inner turmoil the faithful have which seems to be non-existent for unbelievers as they do not believe God can see their actions, saying, "Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches." It then laments, "All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence. For all day long I have been stricken and rebuked every morning." Although he feels this way, the psalmist acknowledges speaking so would undermine others' faith. Right as the psalmist grows weary, he enters the sanctuary and is reminded of the end of both the pious and the wicked. The wicked fall to ruin with no hope of being received in the afterlife, distant from God. The psalmist repents for his bitterness saying, "I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you." It then goes on to praise that God is always with us, giving us counsel, and will be there to receive us in the end. He expresses that there is nothing in heaven or on earth he desires but God. It says, "My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever." It ends with the psalmist expressing that it is good to be near God, that he is his refuge, and that he will tell of his works.

## 74. Arise, O God, Defend Your Case

A psalm of Asaph lamenting a disaster that has come upon Israel, likely the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem. It begins with, "O God, why do You cast us off forever? Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture? Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old, which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your heritage!" It prays that God remember Zion during the destruction of the temple, asks how long they are to suffer, and asks the enemy be destroyed. It remembers his mighty deeds, and prays for deliverance. It prays that God remember his covenant.

## 75. God Will Judge with Equity

A psalm of Asaph, giving thanks to God for judging his people with equity. It begins with, "We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds." Then, God speaks and promises he will work his perfect judgment over the earth, rebuking the wicked and prideful, and lifting up the pious and the humble. God says, "At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity." The implication being that the pious must wait on God's justice. It describes how the wicked fully experience God's judgment saying, "all the wicked of the earth will drain [the wine of wrath] down to the dregs." It ends with, "The horns of the righteous shall be lifted up." Horns, like the horns of a ram, are a symbol of power, they are not good, nor evil, but this prayer is that the horns of the righteous be lifted up and the horns of the wicked be cut off.

## 76. Who Can Stand Before You?

A song from Asaph celebrating Zion as God's chosen dwelling place, perhaps written in a time where God delivered Zion from invaders, like the time he defeated 185,000 Assyrians in the days of Hezekiah. It begins with, "In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel. His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion. There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war." It acknowledges God's glory, which can never be overshadowed by human might. It says, "From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still, when God arose to establish judgment, to save all the humble of the earth." It ends with, "Make your vows to the Lord your God and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared, who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared by the kings of the earth."

## 77. In the Day of Trouble I Seek the Lord

A psalm of Asaph. A community lament in which one's pain and trouble is brought honestly and openly before God, whose wondrous deeds remind us to be hopeful for the future. It opens with, "I cry aloud to God, alout to God, and he will hear me. In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord." It describes the painful, sleepless nights brought about by trouble, and the longing for a return to a closeness with God once had long ago. It asks honestly, worrying if God's character has ceased, "Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable? Has his steadfast love ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time? Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" The response and answer to these questions are found in the "years of the right hand of the Most High," meaning the deeds, wonders, and works God has already displayed for his people. The psalmist vows to "remember the deeds of the Lord," and "ponder all [his] work, and meditate on [his] mighty deeds." He says, "You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples." It ends with, "Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen. You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron." This psalm shows how our pain can be brought honestly and openly before God, and that even when we must travel "through the sea" (the difficult, yet miraculous way), the work he has shown us will sustain our everlasting trust in him.

## 78. Tell the Coming Generation

A psalm of Asaph. A historical psalm which recounts the events from Israel's past that show how God delivered them even when they were unfaithful. It begins with the events of the Pentateuch and ends with the reign of David. The intent is to call future generations to obey the covenant, remember the mistakes of their fathers, and to remember God's glory. It begins calling the congregation to listen to the psalmist's parable, and says, "[We will] tell the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might, and the wonders that he has done…so that they should not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments; and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation." It recounts how God delivered Israel from Egypt, but how they rebelled in the wilderness. How God drove out the Canaanites from the land, but they did not keep his commandments. How Israel brought the ark into battle, but were defeated by the Philistines. It then describes how God "awoke as from a sleep" and chose David from the tribe of Judah (and not Ephraim because of their rebellion, likely starting with Micah setting up his own sanctuary in Judges) to be his servant and Israel's king, and chose Mount Zion as his sanctuary. It ends saying about David, "With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand."

## 79. How Long, O Lord?

A psalm of Asaph lamenting a disaster that has come upon Israel, likely the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem. It begins with, "O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance, they have defiled Your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins." It continues, "How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever?" It prays the nations be destroyed, and Israel's sins forgiven. It prays for salvation for the glory of his name. It ends describing that when they are delivered they will praise him continually, saying, "But we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise."

## 80. Restore Us, O God

A song and testimony from Asaph, which laments oppression by a foreign nation, and prays for God's deliverance and restoration. It begins with, "Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us!" Then the refrain, "Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved!" It laments God's judgment against his people in which they suffered hardship among the nations, and repeats the refrain, "Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved!" It recounts how God delivered them from Egypt and planted them in the promised land like a fruitful vine. It laments how now, enemy nations ravage their fruit. It prays God turn again to Israel and have regard for the vine. It says, "But let your hand be on the man whom You have made strong for Yourself! Then we shall not turn back from You; give us life, and we will call upon Your name!" It ends with the refrain, "Restore us, O Lord God of hosts! Let your face shine, that we may be saved!"

## 81. Oh, That My People Would Listen to Me

A psalm of Asaph, set around the time of the Feast of Trumpets. It reviews the covenant, recounts how Israel did not listen, and expresses God's hope that the people of Israel would do so. It begins with, "Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob!" It recounts how God delivered them from Egypt and tested them at Meribah. It recounts how Israel did not listen and turned away to worship other gods. It says, "Israel would not submit to me. So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels." It declares, "Oh, that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!" It ends expressing that if Israel heeds the commands of God, he will deliver them, restore them, and provide for them.

## 82. Rescue the Weak and Needy

A psalm of Asaph, praying that God will judge unjust rulers and ultimately bless all nations. It begins with a court scene where God takes his place before the unjust rulers of the land and confronts them, saying, "How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked?" God commands, "Give justice to the weak and fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked." The psalmist says that these unjust rulers have no knowledge or understanding, and that they walk about in darkness, and disrupt God's divine order. God reminds them that although they hold positions of power, they are but flesh, and will ultimately perish like any other man. The prayer ends with, "Arise, O God, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all the nations!"

## 83. O God, Do Not Keep Silence

A psalm of Asaph, praying that God will thwart Israel's enemies who threaten their very existence so that all nations will come to know he is God Most High. It begins with, "O God, do not keep silence; do not hold your peace or be still O God! For behold, Your enemies make an uproar; those who hate You have raised their heads." It describes how these enemies look to devote Israel to destruction, which is ultimately an attack on the Lord and his covenant with his chosen people. It then prays that the Lord do to these enemies as he did to Midian, Oreb, Zeeb, Zebah, and Zalmunna (all from the story of Gideon in Judges) and Sisera and Jabin (both from the story of Deborah and Barak in Judges). In all of these cases, the odds were against Israel, but with God's help, they triumphed. The psalm ends praying that through God's deliverance and judgment, the enemy will be destroyed, or will repent and come to know the Lord is Most High over all the earth.

## 84. My Soul Longs for the Courts of the Lord

It continues, "My heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God." It says, "Even the sparrow finds a home," and, "Blessed are those who dwell in your house, ever singing your praise!" It describes how the journey to Zion is a long hard journey through the desert, but those who find strength in the Lord and whose hearts are set on God make the desert a palace of springs, finding new levels of strength until they appear before God in Zion. It prays for the king to protect and represent Israel before God. It says, "I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness." It ends saying the Lord is a sun (light) and a shield (protection), and by saying, "No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly, O Lord of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in you!"

## 85. Revive Us Again

A psalm from the sons of Korah. It's a community lament at a time when God has shown his displeasure over his people's unfaithfulness, perhaps by withholding fruitfulness from the land. It seeks God's forgiveness and steadfast love. It begins with, "Lord, you were favorable to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob. You forgave the iniquity of the people; you covered all their sin." It prays, "Restore us again, O God of our salvation." It prays that God will restore his people so they can rejoice in him.

It prays for God's grace, as he is the one we call on in the day of trouble, and he is abounding in steadfast love to all who seek him. It acknowledges God as the one God to whom all nations shall come. He says, "Teach me your way, O Lord, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name.

It ends saying, "Singers and dancers alike say, 'All my springs are in you.'"

## 88. I Cry Out Day and Night Before You

A song from the sons of Korah, of Heman. It is an individual lament about someone so overwhelmed with trouble that even his friends shun him (similar to Job). It is unique in that there is no explicit statement of confidence (though it is implied). It shows how one can bring their pain honestly before God. It shows how faith can be real, even when it cannot arrive at an answer. It begins with, "O Lord, God of my salvation, I cry out day and night before you; incline your ear to my cry!" The psalmist says, "My soul is full of troubles," and compares his suffering to one dying under God's wrath. On top of trouble, the psalmist's companions have all but left him and he is growing weary. It ends with the psalmist falling helplessly before God, crying out to him.

## 89. I Will Sing of the Steadfast Love of the Lord

A psalm of Ethan the Ezrahite celebrating the covenant God made with David as he has been chosen to lead God's people in faithfulness, and lamenting the distress (possibly exile) they are facing, which is interpreted as God's wrath against the anointed. It begins with, "I will sing of the steadfast love of the Lord, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations." It describes the covenant God made with David in that he is anointed and his offspring shall be established forever. It describes how God is the Creator and Ruler of the heavens and the earth, who rules with love and justice, and says, "Our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel." It describes how God chose and anointed David to rule with his steadfast love and faithfulness, and how God will keep his covenant with David as long as he and his offspring follow God's commands. If they do not, they will be punished. It switches to lamenting a dire situation described as God's wrath and as the renouncing of his covenant saying, "You have exalted the right hand of his foes." The psalmist asks, "How long will your wrath burn like fire?" It describes man's life on earth as short-lived, and asks for God to remember his covenant. It ends the section and the book with a doxology, "Blessed be the Lord forever! Amen and Amen."

## 90. From Everlasting to Everlasting

A lament from Moses after the people of Israel rebel and enter Canaan without God's presence and are struck down. Moses acknowledges God is everlasting, eternal, and unchanging, and that man's life is fleeting.

He says God's wrath should cause great reverence. He prays that God will teach his people to live faithfully. He prays that God will have mercy so that they may once again rejoice. He prays that the glory of God will be shown to his people so that they can be blessed in the pursuit of their calling.

## 91. My Refuge and My Fortress

After Moses dies and Joshua takes over, the people are about to enter the promised land, and war is imminent. This psalm is thought to be from the perspective of Israel as a whole, but could possibly be written by Moses and set to music by one of the psalmists. It begins by stating that he who trusts in God will be protected ("he is my refuge and my fortress."). It conveys that although trouble, disease, terror, and distruction may arise, in the Lord you will find refuge and "his faithfulness is a shield." The psalm closes by describing trust in God. Because he holds fast to me, I shall trust him, protect him, answer him, and honor him. He will be with us in trouble, and our life will be long so that we may show him our salvation.

## 92. How Great Are Your Works

A song for the Sabbath. It begins with, "It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to Your name, O Most High; to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night, to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre. For you, O Lord, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy." It describes how although the wicked "sprout like grass", they are destined for destruction.

## 93. The Lord Reigns

Psalms 93–99 are psalms of divine kingship. A hymn of praise for God's kingly rule over creation.

Your throne is established from old; you are from everlasting." It beautifully expresses how God is mightier than the raging sea, a vivid emblem of uncontrollable chaos.

Placed in the midst of the psalms of divine kingship, this is a community lament for a time when the wicked use their social and political power to oppress the righteous. It reminds such people that God is sovereign over all. It begins with, "O Lord, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth!" It prays God judge the wicked who proudly and arrogantly exult in the oppression of the righteous, thinking that God does not see all that they do. The psalmist says, "He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see? He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge—the Lord—knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath." He continues explaining how those whom the Lord disciplines are blessed because he teaches them his law, frees them from trouble, and saves them from the wicked. He explains that if this were not the case, his soul would have "lived in the land of silence," and the Lord wouldn't have lifted his spirits. He tells the pious not to fear the wicked, even when they have power, because God is just, and they will ultimately reap what they sow.

An individual lament from one who is experiencing unexplained suffering, but has hope that God will restore his people. It begins with, "Hear my prayer, O Lord; let my cry come to you! Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress!" The psalmist then vividly describes his pain saying, "My heart is struck down like grass and has withered." The psalmist laments that his suffering is due to God's anger, and he contrasts his mortality and temporary affliction with God's enduring life and eternal reign. He says, "You, O Lord, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations."

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgives your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's." It echoes God's character from exodus saying, "He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel, The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love." He goes on to further describe his character by saying, "As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him. For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust." He contrasts man's mortality with God's everlasting love, and expresses confidence that God will pass this love on to the future generations of those who keep his covenant.

It goes on to beautifully describe God's majesty over creation, saying, "From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work." It acknowledges God not only as the provider, but as the God that gives us abundance. It praises the order he created for all things, saying, "In wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creatures," and, "These all look to you, to give them their food in due season…When you open your hand, they are filled with good things. When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.

It begins with, "Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever! Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, who he has redeemed from trouble and gathered in from the lands." The first group "wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in."

They cry out to the Lord and he brings them out of darkness and frees them. The third group "were fools through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction; they loathed any kind of food and they drew near to the gates of death." They cry out to the Lord and he heals them with his Word and saves them from destruction. The fourth group "went down to the sea in ships" and got caught in a storm. They cry out to the Lord and he makes the storm be still and brings them to their destination. The psalm concludes discussing the ways in which the Lord may make a fruitful land a desert and restore it again, free the oppressed, or raise up the needy. It ends with, "Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things; let them consider the steadfast love of the Lord."

I will sing and make melody with all my being…For your steadfast love is great above the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the clouds." He prays God's glory will be over all the earth. He recounts how Israel is God's chosen people to whom he promised the land, and poetically describes the cities that surround Jerusalem, even enemy territory, as being under God's rule. He feels as though God has all but rejected Israel. It ends with a prayer God will once again deliver them, saying, "Oh grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man!

He prays for God's vindication, and prays they suffer the same fate, saying, "When he is tired, let him come forth guilty; let his prayers be counted as sin!" He continues, "For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted, to put them to death. He loved to curse; let curses come upon him!" He then prays for God's deliverance, and prays his accusers will see that it was the Lord who saved him, saying, "Let them curse, but you will bless. They arise and are put to shame, but your servant will be glad!" It ends saying he will give thanks to God before the great congregation, for he is the one who saves the needy and accused.

## 110. Sit at My Right Hand

A royal psalm of David which looks forward to the Messiah. It begins with, "The Lord says to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." When David says, "My Lord" he is indicating that the Messiah is greater than he. In this verse, God is telling the future Davidic king to sit at his right hand, a position of honor, and that he will subdue the enemy. The next section describes how in the midst of the enemy, the Messiah will successfully rule over the people, who will offer themselves freely. He says that the Messiah will be a priest and a king, similar to Melchizedek. He describes how the Messiah will execute judgment and rule victoriously as the King of kings.

## Egyptian Hallel Psalms

* * *

## 113. Who Is like the Lord Our God?

Psalms 113–118 are called the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hallel" text="Hallel" /> Psalms because of their later connection with Passover. Psalm 113 is a hymn of praise, reminiscent of Hanna's song. It begins giving praise to the Lord, and urges the faithful to praise his name day and night. It describes how the Lord is above all nations. It says, "Who is like our Lord our God, who is seated on high, who looks far down on the heavens and the earth?" It describes how God raises up the poor and the needy to sit with princes, and gives the barren women and home and children, and ultimately joy. It ends the way it starts, "Praise the Lord!"

## 114. Tremble at the Presence of the Lord

A psalm celebrating the Exodus and God's dominion over the earth and his people. It begins with, "When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion." It poetically describes God's parting of the Jordan under the leadership of Joshua, and sings, "The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs." It ends calling all to be in awe of God's power, describing the events of Exodus and Numbers where he brought water out from a rock, saying, "Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water."

## 115. To Your Name Give Glory

A post-exilic hymn urging God's people to trust and worship the Lord alone, describing the hopelessness of idolatry. It begins with, "Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!" It describes nations who practice idolatry, saying, "Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands." It describes how these idols have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear; and how ultimately those who worship idols will become like them, unable to speak, see, and hear. It urges Israel, the house of Aaron, and ultimately all who fear the Lord to trust in him for he is our shield. It prays for the Lord's blessing, and describes how those who die a spiritual death do not praise him, but how the faithful will bless him forevermore. It ends with, "Praise the Lord!"

## 116. I Love the Lord

A hymn of thanksgiving for God's care and deliverance, describing how this deliverance prompts the praising of his name before the great congregation. It begins with, "I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live." It continues, "The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish. Then I called on the name of the Lord; 'O Lord, I pray, deliver my soul!'" It describes how God answered this prayer, and how the Lord "preserves the simple," and saves those brought low and deals "bountifully" with them. It says, "I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living." It asks, "What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me?" The answer is public praise and worship. It ends with, "I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people, in the house of the Lord, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!"

## 117. The Lord's Faithfulness Endures Forever

## 118. His Steadfast Love Endures Forever

A song of thanksgiving which closes out the Egyptian Hallel Psalms. It was perhaps written for the dedication of a new temple. It was later sung at the Feast of Booths as well as Passover, and was most likely the last psalm Jesus sang at the Last Supper with his disciples before they left for Gethsemane. It calls God's people to praise the Lord for his steadfast love, and gives a personal testimony of God's rescue from distress. It begins with, "Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!" It calls all people to remind themselves that his steadfast love endures forever. It says, "Out of my distress I called on the Lord; the Lord answered me and set me free. The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?" It continues, "It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man. It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes." It goes on to describe how evil surrounded the psalmist, and how the Lord delivered him. It says, "The Lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation." It continues, "I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the Lord. The Lord has disciplined me severely, but he has not given me over to death." The psalmist poetically describes joyously and righteously entering the gates of Jerusalem where he may give thanks to the Lord for his deliverance. It says, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone," i.e. the wise were wrong in their judgment of Israel who has now become key in God's plan for the world. It continues, stating that this was the Lord's doing. It goes on to describe rejoicing, thanksgiving, and sacrificing in the temple for God's faithful love, light, and goodness. It ends with, "Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!"

## 119. Your Word Is a Lamp to My Feet

The longest chapter in the Bible. An acrostic poem of 22 stanzas with 8 verses each, each verse beginning with the same letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The author is unknown, but this psalm demonstrates the author's love of the Word of God, shows his understanding of God's character, and expresses that his Word keeps him walking in nearness and obedience to God. It begins with, "Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord! Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart, who also do no wrong, but walk in his ways!" He prays that his ways be steadfast so he may keep the Lord's commandments and learn his righteous rules. He says, "I have stored up your Word in my heart, that I might not sin against You." He prays God continues to teach him his law, in which he delights more than riches. He expresses that although the wicked, perhaps even wicked rulers, conspire against him, he will meditate on God's law at all times. He expresses that God's Word gives life to a heart inclined to death (spiritual death or darkness). He prays God make him understand his laws, which ultimately give him strength, and put false ways far from him. He wants God to incline his heart to his testimonies, not to selfish gain. He says, "Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways." He knows God's Word will give him confidence in the face of adversaries, even kings, saying, "Let Your steadfast love come to me, O Lord, Your salvation according to Your promise; then shall I have an answer for him who taunts me, for I trust in Your Word." God's promise gives him hope, life, and joy. He says the Lord is his portion. He admits that before, he was afflicted. He went astray, but now he keeps God's Word, which is more valuable than material riches; God is good. He says, "I know, O Lord, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me." He asks God to comfort him. He expresses that God's faithfulness endures to all generations. Had God's law not been his light, he would have perished in the darkness (or affliction). He says, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." He prays God keeps him away from evildoers and oppressors so he may keep his commandments. He prays, "Keep steady my steps according to Your promise, and let no iniquity get dominion over me." It ends with, "I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments."

The first song of ascents (Psalms 120–134), perhaps the songs sung on the ascent to Jerusalem. The psalmist sings that he called for the Lord in distress and the Lord answered him.

He states that he is sojourning in Meshech (southeastern edge of the Black Sea) and in Kedar (Arabian desert) and that he is dwelling among those who hate peace.

It sings of how God restored their fortunes, and how it was seen among the nations. It prays God will once again restore our fortunes like he did so long ago.

## 127. Unless the Lord Builds the House

A song of ascents from Solomon. A wisdom psalm explaining that human toil is worthless without the Lord's blessing. It begins with, "Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. It is in vain that you rise up yearly and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep." He then expresses that one's children are one's inheritance from God, and that if one works hard to raise their children to be righteous and upright, they will be blessed, and will not be put to shame. He compares these children to arrows in the hand of a warrior when he meets his enemies at the gate of the city (where justice is served).

## 128. Blessed Is Everyone Who Fears the Lord

A song of ascents which is a blessing to those who fear the Lord. It begins with, "Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in his ways!

For the with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with him is plentiful redemption. And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities."

## 131. I Have Calmed and Quieted My Soul

A psalm of ascents from David. It begins with, "O Lord, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised to high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me. But I have calmed and quieted my soul." It compares this calmed state to a weaned child with its mother calm and content in her presence, implying the faithful worshiper is simply content with God's presence. It ends with, "O Israel, hope in the Lord! For with the Lord there is steadfast love, and with thim is plentiful redemption. And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities."

## 132. The Lord Has Chosen Zion

A psalm of ascents, a royal psalm, about God's covenant with the house of David. It begins with, "Remember, O Lord, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured, how he swore to the Lord and vowed to the Might One of Jacob."

It describes how there, God will bless his people, provide for them abundantly, and protect them. It ends with God saying about David, "His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine."

## 133. When Brothers Dwell in Unity

A song of ascents from David. It begins with, "Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!" The phrase "dwell in unity" is the same used in the cases of Abram and Lot and Jacob and Esau when they could no longer dwell together because the region couldn't support it. This psalm describes a situation in which the land is fruitful enough for brothers (or perhaps Israelites journeying to Jerusalem) to dwell in unity, highlighting God's provision and peace. This unity of brothers, family, or congregation is what is good and pleasant. It continues, saying that this unity is "like the precious oil on the head [of Aaron]." This provision and unity is holy, as is the consecrating oil. Living peacefully together in the promised land is much like being set apart by God and experiencing his nearness. It goes further by saying, "It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion!" Much like the rain or dew on the highest mountains in Israel, living peacefully with God's providence is restorative, and causes growth, abundance, and flourishing. It ends saying, "For there the Lord has commanded the blessing, live forevermore."

## 134. Come, Bless the Lord

The final song of ascents which is well suited for the opening or closing of a worship service, perhaps a feast.

Praise the name of the Lord, give praise, O servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God! Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing to his name, for it is pleasant." It sings of how the Lord chose Jacob as his possession, and how he is sovereign over the heavens and the earth and is above all other Gods. It sings of how God struck down the firstborn of Egypt, sent signs and wonders against Pharoah, and stuck down mighty kings of many nations to give the promised land as a heritage to Israel. It says, "Your name, O Lord, endures forever, your renown, O Lord, throughout all ages. For the Lord will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants." Similar to psalm 115, it describes how idols have mouths, but do not speak, and ears, but do not hear, as do those who worship them. It ends calling all houses of Israel to bless the Lord, and says, "Blessed be the Lord from Zion, he who dwells in Jerusalem! Praise the Lord!"

## 136. His Steadfast Love Endures Forever

## 137. How Shall We Sing the Lord's Song?

A community lament remembering the Babylonian captivity. It begins with, "By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion." It speaks of how they were made to sing by their captors and says, "How shall we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?" The singer desperately prays to remember the Lord amid the chaos in the land of their captors. It prays that their captors and those who were cruel during the exile reap what they sow.

## 138. Give Thanks to the Lord

Psalms 138–145 are the final collection of psalms attributed to David. Psalm 138 provides a way of offering thanks to God for signs of his constant care. It begins with, "I give You thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart; before the gods I sing Your praise." He sings how he bows towards God's holy temple, giving gratitude for his steadfast love. He says, "For You have exalted above all things Your name and Your Word." He thanks God for answering his prayers and renewing his strength. He says, "All the kings of the earth shall give You thanks, O Lord…For though the Lord is high, he regards the lowly, but the haughty he knows from afar." He continues, "Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life." It ends with, "The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; Your steadfast love, O Lord, endures forever.

He describes how God formed him, and wrote the days of his life before he lived them. He says, "Precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!" He prays God deliver him from the wicked who take the Lord's name in vain. It ends with, "Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!"

## 140. Deliver Me, O Lord, from Evil Men

A psalm of David asking God to deliver him from violent men looking to do evil and "stir up wars continually." He compares their lies to a venomous snake. He says, "preserve me from violent men, who have planned to trip up my feed." He pleas for mercy and prays to the Lord, "my strength of salvation."

He prays for deliverance from his enemies and asks God to teach him to do his will. He says, "Let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground." He prays God will bring his soul out of trouble, and ends with confidence God will deliver him saying, "And in Your steadfast love You will cut off my enemies, and You will destroy all the adversaries of my soul, for I am Your servant."

It ends with, "My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord, and let all the flesh bless his holy name forever and ever."

## 148. Praise the Name of the Lord

A hymn calling all creation to praise the Lord with great reverence. Just as he created heaven and earth and all its creatures, so too did he create man. All are called to praise him, and like the wind, go where he sends us. It begins with, "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights!
