## Synopsis

The Book of <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="iyov" text="Job" /> deals with the question of why God lets righteous people suffer.

## Prologue

* * *

## 1. Satan Takes Job's Property & Children

God allows Satan (the accuser) to test Job, a blameless man from Uz, because he says that Job only does good because God blesses him. Job loses everything he has including his children. Job falls before God and prays, but does not sin.

## 2. Satan Attacks Job's Health

God allows Satan (the accuser) to further test Job because he says that Job only remained faithful because God spared his health. Satan strikes Job with sores all over his body. His wife suggests cursing God, but Job rebukes. He still does not sin. Job's three friends (Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar) come to see him. No one speaks a word to him for seven days and seven nights because they see his suffering is great.

## Cycle 1

* * *

## 3. Job Laments His Birth

Job laments his birth and wonders if it would have been better to never see the light than to see the light and have it turn to darkness. Job wonders why light is given to those who are suffering.

## 4. Eliphaz: The Innocent Prosper

Eliphaz suggests that Job is being impatient and that he must have sinned in some way because suffering is a result of sin. Eliphaz asks if mortal man can even be right before God. He mentions that even the fierce lion can't alter natural law, and therefore Job can't possibly alter moral law. He states that even angels are found at fault before God.

## 5. Eliphaz: Accept God's Discipline

Eliphaz reinforces his point by saying affliction doesn't come from the dust or ground, but out of what is sown from the day a person is born. He suggests that if Job accepts God's discipline, he will be spared from his trouble and brought to a ripe old age.

## 6. Job: My Complaint Is Just

Job wishes for death. Job asks Eliphaz why he should be patient when he is blameless and has nothing left. He tells Elipaz that he who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty. Job argues to Eliphaz that he should be able to speak the truth, and that he is innocent. Job tells Eliphaz his vindication is at stake.

## 7. Job: My Life Has No Hope

Job unapologetically states he will speak the truth. He then asks God why he is being tested so harshly and asks God why he can't be vindicated.

## 8. Bildad: Job Should Repent

Bildad echoes a similar sentiment to Eliphaz and suggests that God is just. Bildad suggests that Job's children may have sinned, and that resulted in their death. He tells Job to plead to God for mercy suggesting that God will not reject a blameless man.

## 9. Job: There Is No Arbiter

Job asks how a man can be in the right before God. Job agrees that God is just, but makes the case that there is no room for him to make the case that he is innocent. He says it is as if God destroys the blameless *and* the wicked. Job longs for someone who can hear his case impartially so that he may speak freely.

## 10. Job: A Plea to God

Job pleads to God honestly asking why God has contended against him. He says that if he sins, he will be punished, but if he is right, he is made to suffer. He asks why he was even born. He asks for a reprieve from suffering while he still has days left in the light of life.

## 11. Zophar: You Deserve Worse

Like Eliphaz and Bildad, Zophar assumes Job has sinned, and believes Job's words to be prideful and wrong. He too hopes that God will answer Job, but believes God's answer will be one of condemnation. He says that a man who has sinned cannot know God rightly. He says instead of insisting he is right, Job should seek repentance.

## 12. The Lord Has Done This

Job attempts to make his friends see the irony of their claims by asking what makes them so sure they have the secrets of wisdom, and tells them he is not inferior to them. He says it is easy to have contempt for misfortune when you yourself are at ease. He points out that their approach to wisdom seems to ignore the realities of the suffering of the righteous and the safety of the wicked. He also points out that the extent of God's wisdom is even greater than they assume, saying that both the deceived and deceiver are his.

## 13. Job: Still I Will Hope in God

Job argues that his friends have provided bad counsel based on false accusations of his character, and that they should be wary of speaking on God's behalf. He decides to take his case up directly with God, regardless of the consequences. Though he is taking a risk, he has faith God will listen.

## 14. Job: Death Comes Soon to All

Job acknowledges man's mortality and suffering. He longs for renewal in which God would forgive his sin, but makes the claim that God will wear a man down over the course of his life.

## Cycle 2

* * *

## 15. Eliphaz: Job Does Not Fear God

Eliphaz claims that Job does not fear God and restates his earlier claim that the consequence of wickedness is suffering, and thus suffering indicates a person is wicked and should not protest innocence. He says, "Your own mouth condemns you." He says, "[Even] the heavens are not pure in his sight."

## 16. Job: Miserable Comforters Are You

Job responds to Eliphaz again stating that his friends are not comforting him in his time of suffering. He then continues to lament that he is made to suffer greatly even though he is innocent and his prayers are pure. He has faith there is an arbiter in heaven who will hear his plea.

## 17. Job: Where Then Is My Hope?

Job argues to his friends that to simply take their advice and repent is to lose faith that God is just and will vindicate the innocent which leaves death as his only option, which is no hope at all.

## 18. Bildad: God Punishes the Wicked

In frustration, Bildad asks who is Job to question his friends and say they are foolish? He then goes on to describe how God punishes the wicked.

## 19. Job: My Redeemer Lives

Job worries he is being punished unjustly, implying he is unsure of God's justice. He once again asks why his friends pursue him. He argues that if his suffering is a result of his sin as they suggest, God would already be acting with just retribution and so they should show him mercy and not torment him further. He argues that if God really is just as they say, they should be wary of falling under his sword (judgment), the same sword they claim to carry. He wishes his words would be written in a book and inscribed in a rock for he knows his Redeemer lives and will stand upon the earth.

## 20. Zophar: The Wicked Will Suffer

In frustration, Zophar rebukes Job and criticizes his desire to be vindicated, implying yet again he must be wicked. He implies that Job's fortune was a result of the oppression of others. He then outlines the short and insufferable life of the wicked.

## 21. Job: The Wicked Do Prosper

Job makes the point that the wicked prosper, living successful lives while completely turning away from God. They then die without ever knowing of or learning from their sins, and are often praised by other men.

## Cycle 3

* * *

## 22. Eliphaz: Job's Wickedness Is Great

Eliphaz claims that because wisdom is profitable to the person and not somehow profitable to God, suffering has no purpose other than to indicate a need to repent. He then accuses Job of implying God is so high he is unable to judge life on earth, and describes likely ways Job has sinned and tells him "Agree with God and be at peace."

## 23. Job: Where Is God?

Job implies that his friends have not persuaded him of his guilt. He tells his friends he wishes he could come before God because he knows God would understand and vindicate him.

## 24. Job: The Wicked Are Not Always Judged

Job outlines once more that his friends fail to realize that the wicked are not always judged as they suggest.

## 25. Bildad: Man Cannot Be Righteous

Bildad argues once more that man cannot be right before God.

## 26. Job: God's Majesty Is Unsearchable

Job points out that although his friends are defending that God is just, they have neither actively helped the poor or the needy, nor have they seen that they themselves have wrongfully judged the circumstance of those in need to be the result of their own sin. He then describes how we can never fully understand the extent of God's power.

## 27. Job: I Will Maintain My Integrity

Job maintains his integrity and tells his friends to consider whether they are the ones who stand in danger of God's judgment.

## 28. Job: Where Is Wisdom?

Job points out that although man has shown great skill in mining the earth for valuable resources, he is unsure of where to find wisdom and understanding, which is beyond measure in its value and outside the sphere of mere discovery. He explains that God understands and governs wisdom and says, "the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding."

## 29. Job's Summary Defense

Job reflects on how he has been righteous in his life, and remembers the days when God blessed him greatly.

## 30. Job's Summary Defense Continued

Job contrasts the honor of his past with his present suffering and lack of hope.

## 31. Job's Final Appeal

Job confesses that he has lived his life in the pursuit of righteousness and wishes the charges would be presented to him so he could give an account.

## 32. Elihu Rebukes Job's Three Friends

The youngest of the group, Elihu, states that he has waited to hear the older men speak, but claims he is angry they have not refuted Job nor answered his words. He says that he will speak honestly and without flattery.

## 33. Elihu Rebukes Job

Elihu claims that although Job stated God has contended against him without answering his words, God does in fact answer by being merciful to the unwise and saving them from death.

## 34. Elihu Asserts God's Justice

Although Elihu believes he is answering Job, he is actually repeating a similar sentiment to that of his friends by stating God is just and that to say otherwise is to say God is wrong. He says God has no need to consider a man further, and that Job not only must have sinned, but is now being rebellious and arrogant towards God.

## 35. Elihu Condemns Job

Elihu argues that Job is acting as if his righteousness grants him some expectation of favor before God and that people often cry out in pride rather than in prayer to God, and thus he does not regard their cries, much less Job's foolish words.

## 36. Elihu Extols God's Greatness

Elihu speaks "on God's behalf" saying that Job's situation is an example of God using affliction to deliver the righteous from their sin saying, "He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity". Elihu asks Job to acknowledge God's majesty.

## 37. Elihu Proclaims God's Majesty

Elihu describes God's majesty and asks if Job knows how God does any of what he does. Elihu presents the two options of responding to God's majesty as exhibiting fear of God, or being wise in your own conceit, the latter being something God will not respond to.

## 38. The Lord Answers Job

God shows up in a whirlwind and answers Job. God asks Job if he was around for the creation of the universe and if he has the understanding of the order of the cosmos. He reminds Job that the Lord's governance is not limited to what is revealed on earth.

## 39. The Lord: Understanding the Universe

God asks Job if he understands the governance of specific creatures further reminding him that there is much that is hidden from his limited perspective.

## 40. Job Promises Silence / The Lord Challenges Job

God asks Job to answer him, and Job pledges silence. God then goes on to remind Job what it was like to be questioned and judged by those who had drawn wrong conclusions from what was not visible in his circumstances. God explains that Job is questioning something much more extensive than he could comprehend, and uses the Behemoth as an example of one of God's creatures with whom Job cannot contend.

## 41. The Lord Challenges Job Continued

God uses Leviathan as another example of one of God's creatures with whom Job cannot contend. He describes Leviathan as the "king over all the sons of pride". God implies that if Job cannot subdue such beasts, how much less should he presume to be able to maintain his own right toward God. God also implies that although the world is amazing and good, it does not prevent danger and suffering. It is also implied that God is asking for Job's continued trust in his wisdom and character.

## Epilogue

* * *

## 42. Confession / The Lord Rebukes & Restores

Job confesses and acknowledges God's power and admits he spoke of things beyond his knowledge. God rebukes the three friends saying that they have not spoken rightly about him as Job did, implying that Job was right to honestly bring his pain before God through prayer, and that they were wrong to make untrue oversimplifications of God's justice. God calls on the friends to bring Job seven bulls and seven rams and to offer a burnt offering (the most expensive offering). God has Job pray for his friends, which images God's character (slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love and mercy), and God accepts Job's intercession. Job's fortunes are restored twofold, and he is blessed with ten more children.
