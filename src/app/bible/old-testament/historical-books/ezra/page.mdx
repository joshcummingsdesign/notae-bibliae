## Synopsis

After 70 years of exile, King Cyrus of Persia makes a decree that the Israelites may return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="zerubbabel" text="Zerubbabel" /> (from the line of David) and Jeshua the priest lead the people in rebuilding the altar and laying the foundation for the temple. The people rejoice, but the elders who had experienced the first temple weep. They are met with adversaries who appeal to the king to stop the building of the temple, and King Darius of Persia stops the temple construction. They remind Darius of the decree from Cyrus, Haggai and Zechariah prophesy, and the temple construction not only continues, but is funded by the king. The temple is finished and dedicated, and the Passover is celebrated. King Artaxerxes of Persia makes a decree for Jews to return to Jerusalem, to provide further adornment of the temple, and for <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="ezra" text="Ezra" /> the priest (house of Aaron) to establish the Mosaic law and to appoint judges. They travel through dangerous territory with silver and gold for the temple, and God protects them on their journey. When they arrive, they realize the Israelites have intermarried with the Canaanites, thus breaking the laws of the Torah. Ezra mourns and the people repent, but without explicit counsel from God, Ezra enacts a decree that the Israelites are to separate from their Canaanite wives and children.
