## Continued Rise of David

* * *

## 1. David Hears of Saul's Death

David returns to Ziklag from striking down the Amalekites, and three days later, an Amalekite sojourner goes to tell him that Saul has died. David asks him how he knows, and the Amalekite lies to try and gain David's favor and tells him he killed him. David and his men mourn and fast until the evening, and David has the Amalekite executed for killing the LORD's anointed. David laments for Saul and Jonathan, and his lament is recorded in the Book of Jashar (non-biblical written source which also included Joshua's poem about the sun standing still). In his lament he says, "How the mighty have fallen." In his lament he praises Saul, and recounts his great love and respect for Jonathan. Though grievously wronged by Saul, David chooses to graciously acknowledge him publicly in a generous way, providing evidence for his innocent ascent to the throne.

## 2a. David Anointed King of Judah

David asks the LORD if he should go to Judah, and the LORD sends him to Hebron. The men of Judah anoint him as king. He finds out the men of Jabesh-gilead buried Saul, and sends a message to them blessing them and telling them he is the king of Judah. At Mahanaim (capital of Gilead on the Jabbok River), Abner appoints Saul's son Ish-bosheth as king of Gilead, Ashur, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin (unclear how much control he had since the Philistines were in the Jezreel Valley). Ish-bosheth reigns for two years, David reigns for seven years and six months.

## 2b. The Battle of Gibeon

Abner and David's nephew Joab meet at Gibeon and send twelve of their men from each side into battle. The place is called Helkath-hazzurim (field of the sword edges). It is a fierce battle in which Abner's men are defeated. David's nephew Asahel pursues Abner, but is speared by Abner during the pursuit. David's nephews Joab and Abishai pursue Abner to the hill of Ammah (on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon). Abner rallies the people of Benjamin and calls Joab and Abishai off. Joab blows the trumpet to mark the end of fighting. Abner and his men go through the Arabah (south of the Dead Sea) and cross the Jordan River and go to Mahanaim. Joab returns to Hebron. Joab loses 20 men including his brother Asahel, and Abner loses 360 men in the battle. They bury Asahel at Bethlehem with his father.

## 3. Joab Murders Abner

After a long war, the house of Saul becomes weaker and the house of David becomes stronger. David has six children (Amnon, Chileab, Absalom, Adonijah, Shephatiah, and Ithream). Ish-bosheth accuses Abner of sleeping with Saul's concubine Rizpah (essentially accusing him of making a power move and accusing him of attempting a coup against him). This angers Abner and he vows to join David and see that he becomes king. Abner sends messengers to David to make a covenant. David agrees as long as he brings him Michal (Saul's daughter and David's first wife who was given to Paltiel), and she is brought back to David. Abner confers with the elders of Israel and with Benjamin, and they all agree David should be king. Abner comes with 20 men to Hebron to meet David, and they all have a feast. They make a covenant, and David sends Abner away in peace. Joab arrives and is angry that David sent Abner away, and has messengers bring him back to Hebron. Joab murders him at the gate of the city for the death of his brother Asahel. David rebukes Joab and his house, and mourns the death of Abner. They bury Abner at Hebron and David laments his death before Israel and fasts until evening. The people understand that David is blameless. The section ends with David saying, "The LORD repay the evil-doer according to his wickedness!"

## 4. Ish-bosheth Murdered

Two captains of Ish-bosheth's army, Baanah and Rechab stab Ish-bosheth in the stomach while he is taking his noonday rest, and they bring his head to David at Hebron. We learn that Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth who was still a child and was crippled in his feet (perhaps why there was no push to keep the throne in Saul's family). Baanah and Rechab arrive with Ish-bosheth's head looking to seek David's favor, but he rebukes them saying, "How much more [punishment than the Amalekite who 'killed' Saul], when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed." David commands his servants to execute them, and they bury Ish-bosheth's head in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.

## 5a. David Anointed King of Israel / City of David

All of Israel comes to David at Hebron and they officially recognize him as king saying, "we are your bone and your flesh. In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel." The LORD says to David, "You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel." David makes a covenant with the elders before the LORD, and he is anointed king. He was 30 and he reigned for 40 years (7 ½ years over Judah, 33 years over Israel in Jerusalem). David and his men approach the Jebusites in the heavily-fortified stronghold of Zion (Jerusalem—western slope of the Kidron Valley above the city's water source, the spring of Gihon). It's so fortified that the Jebusites say, "The bind and the lame will ward you off." David sends men up the water shaft (often identified as "Warren's Shaft") and they take the stronghold, and drive out the Jebusites saying, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the house." David builds his city there from the Millo (means "the fill", a series of terrace walls on a steep slope with level areas for houses) inward. Hiram, king of Tyre (a trading empire) sends cedars, carpenters, and masons to build David's house. David takes more concubines (against laws of Deuteronomy) and has more children (Sammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Bepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Eliada, Eliphelet).

## 5b. David Defeats the Philistines

The Philistines get word that David is king and come to the Valley of Rephaim (border of Judah and Benjamin). David prays and the LORD says he will give them into his hand. David defeats them and says, "The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like a breaking flood." The place is called Baal-perazim (means the Lord of breaking through). David takes away their idols. The Philistines come up a second time and the LORD tells David to hide behind the balsam trees and attack when he hears the "sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees". David strikes them down from Geba to Gezer.

## 6a. The Ark Brought to Jerusalem

David gathers 30,000 men at Baale-judah (Kiriath-jearim) to bring the ark from the house of Abinadab. They carry it on a new cart with Abinadab's sons Ussah and Ahio. They arrive at the threshing floor of Nacon, the oxen stumble, and Uzzah touches the ark. God strikes him down, and David is angry and afraid. Instead of taking the ark back to the city of David, he takes it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, and it stays there three months. The LORD blesses the house of Obed-edom. David brings the ark out of the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing. David was dancing and wearing a linen ephod, and he made sacrifices to the LORD.

## 6b. David and Michal

Michal looks out the window and sees David dancing and despises him. David and the men place the ark in the tent at the city of David and offer burnt offerings and peace offerings there. David distributes a portion of bread, meat, and cake to all the people, and then they go home. Michal accuses David of "uncovering himself"  in a vulgar manner towards female servants. David responds that he will celebrate before the LORD and will be held in honor. Michal remains childless all her life.

## 7a. The LORD's Covenant with David

Israel has rest from war. David recognizes that he is living in his house of cedar, but that the ark of God is in a tent (it was common for kings to build a temple for their god in that day). The LORD comes to the prophet Nathan and tells him to deliver a message to David. The message is that in the history of Israel, God has never dwelled in a house. The LORD says that He took David from the pasture, made him prince, went before him to cut off his enemies, made him a great name, and gave Israel rest from war in the promised land. God says that he will not let David build Him a house, but rather, God will build David a house, or a ruling dynasty. God says regarding David's offspring, "He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him as a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, but my steadfast love will not depart from him." God establishes David's throne forever (i.e. make the line of David a representative of His people forever).

## 7b. David's Prayer of Gratitude

David sits before the LORD and prays a prayer of gratitude saying, "Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?" David shows humility and great reverence in his prayer saying, "There is none like you, and there is no other God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears." He recounts how God delivered Israel and established them as His people forever, and is grateful that God is now establishing David's house forever. He says, "Your name will be magnified forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts is God over Israel,' and the house of your servant David will be established before you." His prayer ends with, "Now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever."

## 8a. David's Victories

After David defeats the Philistines, he takes Metheg-ammah (perhaps some of their land). He defeats Moab and makes a line of Moabites to be put to death and a line to be spared. The ones he spares become his servants. David defeats Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah (in Syria) and takes 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers. He hamstrings all the horses (probably following God's command for the king not to acquire many horses), but keeps 100 for a small chariot force. The Syrians of Damascus come to help Hadadezer and David defeats them (22,000 men), puts garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Syrians become David's servants. David takes the gold and bronze of Hadadezer to Jerusalem. Toi, the king of Hamath (on the northern border of Zobah), sends his son Joram to bring David silver, gold, and bronze because they were at war with Hadadezer. David dedicates all the precious metals from his victories (Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and Hadadezer) to the LORD. David strikes down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt (east of the Dead Sea), puts garrisons in Edom, and the Edomites become his servants. The LORD gives David victory wherever he goes.

## 8b. David's Officials

David brings justice and equity to Israel. His nephew Joab was commander of the army, Jehoshaphat (son of Alihud) was recorder, Zadok (son of Ahitub) and Ahimelech (son of Abiathar) were priests, Seriah was secretary, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada and one of David's mighty men) was in charge of the Cherethites and the Pelethites (foreigners who made up the king's bodyguards), and David's sons were priests (most likely chaplains for the royal family, not like Levitical priests, they are described later as chief officials in the service of the king).

## 9. David's Kindness to Mephibosheth

David calls for someone from the house of Saul so he may show kindness to them. Ziba, Saul's servant, tells him Jonathan's son Mephibosheth who is crippled in his feet is in the house of Machir (son of Ammiel) at Lo-debar (northern Transjordan). David sends for him and restores the land of Saul to him, says he will eat at his table always (like one of the king's sons), and has him live in Jerusalem. David has Ziba and his 15 sons and 20 servants work the restored land and be Mephibosheth's servants. This fulfills David's covenant with Jonathan not to cut off David's steadfast love from Jonathan's house forever.

## 10. David Defeats Ammon and Syria

Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, dies and Hanun, his son, takes over. David sends servants out to console Hanun since he was on good terms with Nahash, but Hanun's princes tell him they are spies and Hanun shaves off half the beard of each man and cuts off their garments in the middle at their hips to humiliate them and sends them away. David has his men remain at Jericho until their beards grow back. Out of fear, the Ammonites hire soldiers from Beth-rehob, Zobah, Maacah, and Tob (Syria, also known as Aram or Arameans, Aramaic is the common language). David sends Joab and his mighty men to Ammon, and the Ammonites and Syrians draw up against them in battle. Joab and his men are surrounded, so he arrays them against the Syrians, and arrays his brother Abishai against the Ammonites. Joab says, "Be of good courage, and let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to Him." The Sryians and the Ammonites flee, and Joab and his men return to Jerusalem. Hadadezer sends his commander Shobach and his men to Helam (northern Transjordan) to attack Israel, and David and his men defeat them and kill Shobach. Hadadezer's men make peace with Israel and become their servants. The Syrians no longer wish to aid the Ammonites.

## Downfall of David

* * *

## 11. David and Bathsheba

It is the springtime, and war continues on with the Ammonites. All the kings are to go out to battle as was honorable in those days, but David does not go and remains in Jerusalem. He has Joab and his men go to defeat the Ammonites at Rabah and besiege it. As David is walking on the roof of his house, he sees a woman bathing and lusts after her. He finds out she is Bathsheba, the wife of one of his mighty men, Uriah. David sends messengers to her, commits adultery, and gets her pregnant (the child was most definitely his because she had been purifying herself before the events). David then tries to lie and cover things up by getting Uriah drunk and trying to send him home to sleep with his wife, but as one of David's mighty men, he knows that he must remain clean during times of battle, so he refrains from going to his house. David writes a letter to Joab saying he is to let Uriah die in battle, and ironically hands the letter to Uriah to deliver to Joab. Joab sends some of his men, including Uriah, into battle near the wall of the city, and they all get killed. Joab is worried the king would be angry since his men died near the wall of the city, and it was said that Abimelech (son of Gideon / Jerubbaal / Jerubbesheth—some names that contained baal were changed to bosheth meaning shame) died because a woman threw a millstone on him from the wall of the city (Abimelech had his armor-bearer kill him lest they say he was killed by a woman, but they say it anyway). David responds to Joab by saying, "Do not let this matter displease you," indicating that David might have been worried about Joab's anger over losing a valiant soldier. Bathsheba finds out her husband died and mourns his death. After she mourns, David takes her as his wife. This was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

## 12a. Nathan Rebukes David

The LORD sends the prophet Nathan to David, and Nathan tells him a parable about a rich man who has many flocks and herds who steals a poor man's only lamb that he had cared for all its life. David thinks the story is real and is angered, saying, "The man who has done this deserves to die." Nathan tells David *he* is the rich man in the story, and that the LORD has cursed his house because of the evil he has done. The sword shall not depart from his house (foreshadowing death), God will raise up evil against him out of his own house, and God will take his wives from before him in a humiliating way. David repents, and the LORD spares him, but says that his child shall die as David has "utterly scorned the LORD."

## 12b. David's Child Dies

David and Bathsheba's child falls ill, and David fasts and lies all night on the ground, praying that his child would become well. On the seventh day, the child dies. David consecrates himself and worships in the house of the LORD. After, he returns home to eat and the men ask him why he fasted and wept while the child was alive, but not after he died. He explains to them that his fasting and weeping was a plea for God's grace and mercy.

## 12c. Solomon's Birth

David and Bathsheba have a son named Solomon and the LORD loves him and sends a message by Nathan that He shall call him Jedidiah (meaning beloved of the LORD).

## 12d. Rabbah Is Captured

Joab fights against Ramah and captures the "city of waters" (likely their water supply, making defeat imminent). He sends messengers to David to tell him to take the city, lest Joab take it. David and his men go to Rahab and take the city and its spoils. The crown of their king is placed on David's head (75 pounds of gold and precious stone), and the people are put to labor. They defeat all the cities of the Ammonites, and David and the people return to Jerusalem.

## 13a. Amnon and Tamar

This story involves David's children Absalom and Tamar (son and daughter of his wife Maacah), Amnon (son of his wife Ahinoam, Absalom and Tamar's half brother), and Jonadab (son of his brother Shimeah, his nephew, their cousin). Amnon lusts after his own half sister Tamar, a virgin, and his cousin Jonadab tells him to pretend he is ill so she will bring him bread. Amnon does so, but rapes her. To make matters worse, he hates her and throws her out (not only does this add to his evil, it breaks the law of paying the bride price for sleeping with a virgin). She puts ashes on her head and tears her robe that virgins wear and goes away weeping aloud. David hears of this and becomes very angry. Absalom hates Amnon for violating his sister.

## 13b. Absalom Murders Amnon

Two years later, Absalom has sheepshearers and asks David and his servants to join him. David declines, but all of his sons including Amnon go. Absalom instructs his servants to kill Amnon when his "heart is merry with wine," and they do so. The rest of David's sons flee. Someone tells David that Absalom has struck down *all* of his sons. David tears his clothes and lies on the ground, and all of his servants tear their clothes. Jonadab tells him that Absalom alone is dead. This is confirmed when David's watchman sees his other sons coming up the road. David's sons come and weep, and David and all his servants weep bitterly. Absalom flees and goes to his maternal grandfather Talmai, king of Geshur (Transjourdan). After three years, David has some peace regarding the death of his son, and his anger with Absolom wanes.

## 14. Absalom Returns to Jerusalem

Joab knows David has been thinking about Absolom, so in an attempt to get through to him, he sends for a wise woman in Tekoa (Judan hills, about 10 miles south of Jerusalem) and tells her what to say to David. She tells David a parable similar to the Cain and Abel story as if the story is her own. She says she is a widow and one of her sons killed the other, and now the whole clan wants to execute bloodguilt and kill her only son, leaving no heir to the family, and killing the only family she has left. David offers his protection in the name of the LORD. The woman then explains that David's decision also applies to himself, and that he must do what is right and bring his son ("his banished one") home, and to not leave Israel without an heir. David asks the woman if Joab put her up to this, and she admits it. David tells Joab to bring back Absalom, but that Absalom is to live in his own house and not come into the king's presence. Absalom returns and is described as being very handsome with thick, heavy hair. Absalom has three sons and one beautiful daughter named Tamar (likely named after his sister). He lives two years in Jerusalem without seeing David. He sends to Joab twice, but he will not come, so he has his servants set his barley field on fire. Joab comes to him and asks why he did so. Absalom asks to see his father, and says that if he is guilty, he shall be put to death. Joab tells David, and David summons Absalom. David sees Absalom and kisses him.

## 15a. Absalom's Conspiracy

Out of pride, Absalom gets a chariot, horses, and 50 men to run before him, and stands at the gate of the city telling those looking for judgment that there was no one to hear their case, but that if *he* were king, *everyone* would be heard. This wins over the hearts of the people, but is likely empty talk, and is shameful at best. After four years, Absalom asks David if he can go to Hebron to pay a vow he made to the LORD, and David tells him to go in peace. Meanwhile, Absalom sends secret messengers throughout the land to tell his supporters to say when they hear the trumpet, "Absalom is king at Hebron." Two hundred men from Jerusalem go with Absalom, but they know nothing of the conspiracy. At Hebron, Absalom sends for David's counselor Ahithophel. The conspiracy grows.

## 15b. David Flees Jerusalem

David gets word of the conspiracy, and out of fear of his own son decides that he and the entire city shall flee Jerusalem. Everyone flees, but 10 concubines are left to attend to the house. David tells a sojourner named Ittai from Gath that he should return home, but Ittai shows faithfulness to David and says he will go wherever David will go. They pass the brook Kidron (east of Jerusalem) and go toward the wilderness. Abiathar and Zadok come to David with the ark, but David tells them to take the ark back to Jerusalem, and accepts whatever fate God gives him, saying that if he finds favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring him back to Jerusalem. He tells Zadok with his son Ahimaaz and Abiathar with his son Jonathan to stay in Jerusalem. David goes up the Mount of Olives (east of the brook of Kidron) weeping, barefoot, and with his head covered (signs of mourning). All the people cover their heads and weep as they go with him. David finds out his counselor Ahithophel is in on the conspiracy and he prays God turn his counsel into foolishness. As he arrives towards the summit, David is met by Hushai (from Archi, a city on the boundary of Ephraim and Benjamin) who has his coat torn and dirt on his head. David asks him to go to Jerusalem and pretend to be Absalom's servant so he can defeat the counsel of Ahithophel and tell Zadok and Abiathar whatever he hears from the house of Absalom. Hushai (who is called David's friend, which also indicates the title of a royal official) arrives in Jerusalem just as Absalom is entering the city.

## 16a. David and Ziba

David passes beyond the summit of the Mount of Olives where he is met by Ziba who has with him donkeys, bread, raisins, summer fruits, and wine. David asks why he has brought these items, and Ziba says that the items are for David and his men. David asks where Mephibosheth is, and Ziba tells him he sees David's plight as an opportunity to reclaim the kingdom (we don't know if this is true or not, but many Benjamities still feel animosity towards David). David hastily gives Mephibosheth's estate over to Ziba. 

## 16b. Shimei Curses David

David comes to Bahurim, a Benjaminite town on the north side of the Mount of Olives, and Shimai, son of Gera the Benjaminite, comes and curses and throws stones at him, calling him a murderer (referring to Saul and his house). Abishai offers to cut off his head, but David says that it may be that the LORD has told him to curse (perhaps David sees this as punishment for his sin), and that it may be that the LORD will repay him with good for his cursing. The men leave him alone as he curses David along the hillside. They arrive weary at the Jordan.

## 16c. Absalom Enters Jerusalem

Absalom comes to Jerusalem with Ahithophel, and Hushai comes to him and says, "Long live the king!" Absalom is confused about to which king he is referring. Hushai tells him his loyalty is to Absalom (part of the ruse with David). Absalom seeks Ahithopel's counsel, and he tells Absalom to sleep with his father's concubines (who stayed behind to attend to the house). They pitch a tent for Absalom on the roof and he does so before all Israel (humiliating David as prophesied, and claiming the throne). The section ends saying Ahithophel's word was as if one consulted the word of God.

## 17. Hushai Saves David

Ahithophel tells Absalom he will gather 12,000 troops to pursue David while he is weary and discouraged and kill him so Absalom can claim the throne. He and the elders of Israel agree to the plan. Absalom calls for Hushai to see what his thoughts are. Hushai tells him that he disagrees with the plan because David is an expert in war, and his men are mighty. He says his plan would be to gather all Israel and have Absalom go with them to fight David at a "place where he is to be found" (i.e. at a designated place), and to follow him if he withdraws to the city, and to destroy the city (this plan not only includes Absalom, but would give David time to rest and not be surprised by an attack). They go with Hushai's plan, and this section makes it clear that the LORD sought to defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. Wasting no time, Hushai gives intel to Zadok and Abiathar. Jonathan and Ahimaaz are waiting at En-rogel (Job's Well, between Judah and Benjamin), and a female servant was to go and tell them, lest they be seen by Absalom and his men. A young man sees them and tells Absalom, so they flee to Bahurim where the female servant hides them in a man's well. Absalom's men come to find them and she tells them they have gone over the brook. They go to find them, but cannot, so they return to Jerusalem. Jonathan and Ahimaaz go and tell David the news, and David and his men cross the Jordan heading east. Ahithophel hangs himself and is buried with his father (he perhaps knew that the defeat of Absalom meant the defeat of himself, for God was with David not Absalom). Absalom appoints Amasa (Ishmaelite) instead of Joab over the army and they cross the Jordan and camp in Gilead. David and his men come to Mahanaim where Shobi (Ammonite), Machir (Gileadite), and Barzillai (Gileadite) come from a great distance to bring them provisions and beds.

## 18a. Absalom Killed

David gathers his men and sets Joab as commander over one third, Abishai commander over another third, and Ittai over the other third. David says he will go and fight, but the men insist he stay in the city. David asks that they "deal gently" with Absalom. The battle is fierce and 20,000 of Absalom's men are defeated (mostly by the forest and not by the sword). Absalom is riding on his mule and his head with its thick hair gets caught in an oak tree. One of the soldiers sees him and spares him for David's sake, but Joab thrusts three javelins into his heart and ten of Joab's armor-bearers strike Absalom down. Joab blows the trumpet to signal the end of the battle. They bruy Absalom and pile stones on top of him. The Absalom's monument is mentioned at the end of the section (a monument he built for himself, since he had no son, in the King's Valley).

## 18b. David Hears of Absalom's Death

Ahimaaz asks to carry the news to David, but Joab discourages him saying the king will be distraught and sends a Cushite. Ahimaaz insists and follows the Cushite. They run to meet David and watchmen see that the Cushite is running alone, so they know it is good news and not men fleeing. They also see Ahimaaz running and know it's good news. Ahimaaz bows to David and says, "Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king." David asks about Absalom, and Ahimaaz says there was a commotion (perhaps he is trying to break the news gently). The Cushite runs up and David asks about Absalom. The Cushite tells David, "May all the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be like that young man." David goes away and weeps, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"

## 19. David Returns to Jerusalem

Joab finds out David is mourning the loss of Absalom and rebukes him claiming that David is showing more loyalty to the enemy than to the men who saved him. He urges the king to go and speak to the people lest they feel betrayed. David takes his rightful seat at the gate and the people come before him (signifying that he makes peace with them). Tension is rising between the tribes as they look to figure out what to do after Absalom's death. David tells Zadok and Abiathar to ask the elders of Judah to bring him back to Jerusalem, and that Amasa is to be his commander instead of Joab (unclear whether this is due to Joab disobeying his orders about Absalom or whether this is a political move). Judah unites and asks David to come back to Jerusalem and they meet him at Gilgal to bring him across the Jordan. Shimei meets David there and repents for cursing David. Abishai suggests putting him to death for cursing the LORD's anointed, but David forgives Shimei and makes an oath not to kill him. Mephibosheth comes to meet David and tells him that Ziba lied and took his donkey to go to David. David decides that the land inheritance is to be split between Ziba and Mephibosheth. Mephibosheth says Ziba can have it all now that the king is safe. Barzillai, the wealthy 80-year-old man from Gilead who provided food for David at Mahanaim, comes down and David asks him to come with him. Barzillai declines, but offers his servant (or perhaps son) Chimham. David kisses and blesses Barzillai and the people (Judah and half of Israel) cross the Jordan. More tension rises when the northern tribes get word that Judah helped the king across the Jordan. They see it as favoritism. Judah's rebuttal is that unlike Saul's favoritism towards Benjamin, they have been given no special land, food, or gifts from David. The northern tribes feel animosity towards Judah as they felt left out of the crossing of the Jordan, saying they have ten shares in the king. Judah responds with anger.

## 20. The Rebellion of Sheba

Sheba, a "worthless man" from Benjamin and son of Bichri, blows the trumpet and announces a rebellion against David saying, "We have no portion in David." The people of Israel withdraw from David and go with Sheba, but Judah remains loyal and stays with him until they arrive in Jerusalem. David treats the 10 concubines as if they are widows. David orders Amasa to gather Judah within three days, but he fails to do so, so he orders Abishai to pursue Sheba lest Sheba do more harm than Absalom. David's mighty men including Joab go with Abishai. They arrive at the great stone in Gibeon and Joab asks Amasa if it is well with him and takes him by his beard to kiss him, but stabs him in the stomach. A young man says whoever is for David and Joab shall follow them. They move Amasa into a field and cover him with a garment. Joab and his men find Sheba at Abel of Beth-maacah (northern Israel, west of Dan) and begin attacking the walls of the city. A wise woman asks Joab why he wants to destroy a mother city (main city in Israel with daughter villages), and Joab agrees to leave if they deliver Sheba to him. The woman has the people cut off Sheba's head and throw it to Joab, he blows the trumpet and they head back to Jerusalem. The section ends saying Joab is commander, Benaiah was in charge of the mighty men, Adoram was in charge of forced labor, Jehoshaphat was recorder, Sheva was secretary, Zadok and Abiathar were priests, and Ira was David's priest (not like a Levitical priest, more like an advisor).

## 21a. Failure of Saul – David Avenges the Gibeonites

There was a three-year famine in the days of David, and the LORD tells him that there is bloodguilt on Saul since he apparently killed the Gibonites who Joshua swore to the LORD to spare when they deceived him at Gilgal. David goes to the Gibeonites to make atonement, but they don't want money, they want Saul's sons dead. Without seeking the LORD's counsel, David hands over seven of Saul's sons, spairng Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, and they are put to death at the beginning of the barley harvest (April). Rizpah (Saul's concubine and mother of two of the sons) doesn't follow the law to bury her sons on the same day they are hanged, so David takes the bones of Saul and Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead who had stolen them and buries them with the seven sons of Saul in Zela in Benjamin with Saul's father Kish. Only after the men are buried does the famine subside.

## 21b. David & His Mighty Men Part 1

In the days of David, war breaks out with the Philistines and David and his men go to fight. One of the descendants of the giants, Ishbibenob, looks to kill David, but is slain by Abishai. David's men swear he is not to go out into battle any longer lest he "quench the lamp of Israel." Sibecai the Hushathite strikes down another descendant of the giants named Saph. Elhanan the Bethlehemite strikes down Lahmi, the brother of Goliath. David's nephew Jonathan strikes down a descendant of the giants with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot who taunted Israel.

## 22. David's Song of Deliverance

David's song of deliverance he sang when the LORD delivered him from the hands of all his enemies including Saul. It begins with, "The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge, my savior; you saved me from violence. I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies." He vividly describes the dangers that surrounded him, and how the LORD heard his plea and delivered him from all his enemies with a fiery wrath. He describes how the LORD redeemed him in his righteousness as he sought to keep all His commands. He says, "With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless you show yourself blameless; with the purified you deal purley, and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous." He echoes the theme of Hannah's song, describing how the LORD will humble the proud, and give strength to those who take refuge in Him. He says, "You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your gentleness made me great." He describes how the LORD strengthened him as a leader so that others came to seek his leadership. It ends with, "Great salvation He brings to His king, and shows steadfast love to His anointed, to David and his offspring forever."

## 23a. The Last Words of David

The last words of David, which is a song praising God for establishing his house, and contrasting a just ruler and worthless men. The opening describes David as the humble son of Jesse whom the LORD raised up and anointed to ultimately be a king and prophet. It begins with, "The Spirit of the LORD speaks by me; His word is on my tongue. The God of Israel has spoken; the Rock of Israel has said to me: When one rules justly over men, ruling in the fear of God, he dawns on them like the morning light." He contrasts just leadership with worthless men saying, "But worthless men are all like thorns that are thrown away, for they cannot be taken by the hand; but the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they are utterly consumed with fire."

## 23b. David & His Mighty Men Part 2

This section lists David's 37 mighty men. The three main people highlighted are Josheb-basshebeth (a chief who killed 800 men at one time), Eleazar (who helped defeat the Philistines), and Shammah (who defended a plot at Lehi and struck down the Philistines there). It recounts how David thirsted for the water of Bethlehem when he was in the cave of Adullam, and three men broke through the camp of the Philistines to draw him some water, and how David poured out the water to the LORD in honor of the men who risked their lives to bring it to him. Abishai was a chief who became renowned by killing 300 men with a spear and became commander. Benaiah won a name for himself by striking down two Moabites, striking down a lion in a pit after the snow had fallen, and taking the spear from a mighty Egyptian and striking him with it. He became David's bodyguard. Uriah is included in this list.

## 24. Failure of David / Census, Plague, and Altar

God tests David, and out of pride and lack of trust in the LORD, David takes a census of all Israel, most likely to see his military potential. Additionally, he did not take a ransom for each person as the law required. Joab warns him, but David insists, so Joab and the commanders of the army circle all Israel starting at Aroer east of the Dead Sea, up to Jezer, up to Dan, all the way up to Sidon, then down to Tyre along the coast down to Beersheba, then ending back in Jerusalem. They count 800,000 valiant men, and 500,000 men from Judah. David realizes this is a sin and repents. To enact judgment, The LORD tells the prophet Gad to tell David that he is to choose between three years of famine, fleeing from his enemies for three months, or pestilence on the land for three days. David says, "Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hands of man." There is a three-day plague that kills 70,000 men. The LORD relents in Jerusalem at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. David prays to the LORD that since he is responsible for the sin, the people should be spared, and the burden should fall on him and his house (sacrificing himself for the people, reminiscent of Aaron standing between the people). The LORD has Gad tell David to raise an altar (for sacrifices) there instead (reminiscent of God offering a ram in the place of Isaac), so David asks to buy Araunah's land to build the altar. Araunah offers to simply give him the land, but David insists on paying, saying, "I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing." He buys the site for fifty shekels of silver ("the site" most likely being the land on Mount Moriah—the place where God led Abraham to sacrifice Isaac) and builds an altar there. The LORD accepts David's burnt offerings and peace offerings there, and the plague comes to an end.
