## Samuel

* * *

## 1. The Birth of Samuel

A man named Elkanah (described here as an Ephrathite living in Ramah—a city north of Jerusalem in Benjamin a.k.a. Ramathaim-zophim—but who we find out later is a Levite) had two wives, Hannah (who had no children) and Peninnah (who had children). Peninnah provoked Hannah because she had no children (similar to Hagar's attitude toward Sarah), but Elkanah says their love is more valuable than ten sons (a bold statement especially for the time). They go to worship at Shiloh, where Eli and his two sons Hopni and Phinnehas are priests, and Hannah laments to the Lord (she is the only female Scripture records as going to the tabernacle) and promises her son will be a Nazarite when he is born if the Lord answers her prayer for a child. Eli thinks she is drunk, but she confesses and he blesses her. They return home, and after some time she bears a son named Samuel (*heard of God*, *name of God*, or *offspring of God*, because she asked for him from the Lord). After he is weaned, Hannah takes him to the sanctuary with an offering so that he will dwell there forever and be a Nazarite as he is "lent to the Lord." He stays and worships there.

## 2a. Hannah's Prayer

Hannah prayer (a precursor to the Magnificat of Mary which sets the stage for the entire book) is a song of praise or hymn to the God who reverses human fortunes by his mighty power, the Creator beyond all human understanding who protects the faithful. He is a God of knowledge who, despite human evil, humbles the arrogant, feeds the hungry, and raises the poor up to sit with princes. The prayer ends saying the Lord will give strength to his king.

## 2b. Eli's Worthless Sons

Eli's sons (who "did not know the Lord") are abusing the sacrifices made in the sanctuary by eating the parts dedicated to the Lord, which surprises even those coming to worship. Furthermore they would threaten to take sacrifices by force if the worshiper didn't comply. During this time, Samuel was ministering and was clothed with a linen ephod. Eli blesses Elkanah and Hannah during their yearly sacrifices, and Hannah has three sons and two daughters. Eli finds out his sons are also sleeping with women at the entrance of the tent of meeting and rebukes his sons, but they do not listen. The section closes saying it was the will of the Lord to put them to death, and that Samuel continued to grow in stature and favor with the Lord and with man.

## 2c. The Lord Rejects Eli's Household

A prophet comes to Eli and tells him that the Lord has heard of the scorning of the sacrifices, and that the days are coming when he will cut off the strength of Eli's household. He says only one of the members of his household will be spared. He says Hophni and Phinehas will die on the same day and the Lord will raise up a faithful priest.

## 3. The Lord Calls Samuel

The Lord's presence was rare in the time of Eli. The Lord calls Samuel in the tent of meeting at Shiloh while he is lying down, and he thinks that it is Eli who is calling him, so Eli tells him to lie down again. The Lord calls Samuel two more times, so Eli tells him to say, "Speak, Lord, for your servant hears." Samuel does so, and the Lord tells him that he is going to punish the house of Eli. Eli asks what the Lord had told him, and Samuel tells him everything. Eli accepts his fate. Samuel grows and the Lord is with him, he becomes a renowned prophet in Israel, and it becomes known that the Lord appeared again at Shiloh.

## 4. The Philistines Capture the Ark

The Philistines camp at Ebenezer (east of modern Tel Aviv) and Aphek (west of Ebenzer) and go to fight Israel and defeat 4,000 men. The Israelites decide without consulting the Lord to bring the ark of the covenant into battle. 30,000 more men are defeated, including Hophni and Phinehas, and the ark is captured. When Eli, who is 98, hears the news, he falls over backwards and breaks his neck (he judged Israel for 40 years). Phinehas' daughter-in-law gives birth to a son named Ichabod (*the glory has departed or exiled*).

## 5. The Philistines and the Ark

The Philistines bring the ark from Ebenezer to Ashdod, one of the northernmost cities of the Philistine pentapolis near Via Maris (Sea Road). They bring into the house of Dagon (their god), and when they awake the next day, they see that Dagon had fallen. They put him back up, and the next day he had fallen again, but with his head and hands cut off. The Lord then afflicts them with a plague of tumors, so they bring the ark to Gath (east of Ashdod, city of Goliath) and the Lord afflicts them with a plague of tumors. They take the ark to Ekron (another northern city in Philistia west of Judah), but they fear the ark, so they decide to return it to Israel.

## 6–7a. The Ark Returned to Israel

The Philistines put the ark on a new cart with a guilt offering of an image of five golden tumors (five representing the pentapolis—Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, Ekron) and five golden mice (apparently there was also a plague of mice). They have two cows, who have never been yoked and whose calves are returned home, pull the cart (if the cows don't return home to their calves, which is their natural instinct, then it will be God directing them). The calves walk along the highway straight to Beth-shamesh and the Philistines follow after it as far as Beth-shamesh. The ark arrives at the field of Joshua, and the Israelites offer the cows as a burnt offering (only male animals can be offered, so this breaks a command) and have the Levites put the ark and the box of the guilt offering on a great stone. The Philistines return to Ekron, and the great stone becomes an important monument. 70 of the men of Beth-shamesh are struck down because they look at the ark. They send for the people of Kiriath-jearim (near Jerusalem on the borders of Judah, Dan, and Benjamin) to take the ark (the Levites are fully capable of knowing the law and taking the ark or returning it to Shiloh, but they don't, they are afraid and want it off their hands). The people of Kiriath-jearim come and take the ark to the house of Abinadab, and Levite named Eleazar (same name as the earlier Levitical priest) is consecrated and put in charge of it. It remains there, and 20 years pass.

## 7b. Samuel Judges Israel

Samuel tells the people of Israel to put away their gods (Baal and Ashtoreth) and serve the Lord only. The people do so, and Samuel gathers them at Mizpah (north of Jerusalem, the place of assembly for Israel). They fast and pour water out as an act of self-denial and as a confession. The Philistines go up against Israel, Samuel sacrifices a nursing lamb, and God throws the Philistines into confusion with a mighty thunder and are defeated. The Israelites pursue them and strike them as far as Beth-car. Samuel sets up a stone between Mizpah and Shen and calls it Ebenezer (*stone of help*) since it was the Lord who helped them. The Israelites have peace from the Philistines and the Amorites, and their land from Ekron to Gath is restored from the hand of the Philistines. Samuel judges Israel all the days of his life, and travels from Bethel, Gilgal, Mizpah, and Ramah (his home where he builds an altar) to judge.

## Rise of Saul

* * *

## 8. Israel Demands a King

For the first time in Israel's history, Samuel appoints his sons as judges in Beer-sheba, but they quickly turn away from the righteous path, take bribes, and pervert justice. The elders of Israel gather at Ramah before Samuel and demand a king. Samuel prays on this, and the Lord tells him to give them a king, saying they have not rejected Samuel, but have rejected the Lord. The Lord tells Samuel to warn them of the ways of the king. Samuel warns the Israelites that a king will put them in his armies, put them to work, take the best of their fields for his servants, take a tenth of their grain and their vineyards for his officers, and will ultimately be their slaves (and also break the commands of Dueteronomy). He tells them that they will cry out to the Lord, but he will not answer them because they appointed the king themselves. The people don't heed the warning and demand a king like the other nations have so they can judge them and fight their battles (they are denying what makes them unique in wanting to be like other nations and are driven more by fear of man than by love of God). The Lord tells Samuel to give the people what they ask for.

## 9. Saul Chosen to Be King

Kish from Benjamin loses his donkeys and sends his son Saul (a tall and handsome man) and his servant out to find them. They arrive at Zuph (the land of Samuel's ancestor in Ephraim) and Saul wants to return home, but his servant says there is a prophet in town that they should go see to inquire about the donkeys. They have nothing to give him, but the servant has a quarter of a shekel of silver, so they decide to go see him and give him that. They go into the city and some women drawing water tell them he is with the people offering a sacrifice, and those invited will eat. They find Samuel, who the Lord already told about Saul, and he invites them to eat and tells them not to worry about the donkeys since he will receive all that is desirable in Israel. Saul is surprised because he is from the least of the tribes of Israel. Saul and the servant sit at the head of the table and Saul is given the priest's portion (the leg). Saul stays with Samuel (on the roof which is the most desirable spot due to the breeze) and when he wakes up they go out into the street of the city so Samuel can tell him the word of God.

## 10a. Saul Anointed as King

Samuel anoints Saul to be prince and prophesies that he will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in Zelzah (Benjamin) who will tell him the donkeys have been found, then he will go to the oak of Tabor where he will meet three men going to Bethel, one carrying three young goats, one carrying three loaves of bread, and one carrying a skin of wine, and they will greet him and give him two loaves of bread, then he will come to Gibeath-elohim where there is a garrison of the Philistines where he will meet a group of prophets and the Spirit of the Lord will rush upon him and change his heart. He tells Saul to then meet him at Gilgal and wait for him seven days and they will offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. God gives Saul a new heart and all the signs come to pass. People are shocked to see Saul prophesying with the prophets and an expression is made, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" Saul's uncle asks him where he went and he tells him he went to find the donkeys, but doesn't tell him anything more.

## 10b. Saul Proclaimed King

Samuel calls the people to Mizpah and tells them they have rejected God and asked for a king. They choose Saul by lot, but he is hiding (perhaps from fear of accepting his new responsibilities). They find him behind the baggage and he is proclaimed king, and the people say, "Long live the king!" Samuel writes and recites the rights and duties of the king and lays the book before the Lord. Saul returns to his home at Gibeah along with men of valor. Some of the Israelites despise him, but Saul holds his peace.

## 11. Saul Defeats the Ammorites

Nahash the Ammonite captures Jabesh-gilead and threatens to gouge out the right eye of every Israelite. Word gets to Saul and he cuts a yoke of oxen into pieces and sends them throughout Israel to threaten them to meet him and Samuel at Bezek. When they arrive, Saul promises them salvation and divides the camp into three companies. They strike down the Ammonites. There are skeptics in Israel that want to strike down those who appointed Saul, but Saul tells them the Lord worked salvation in Israel, and that they shall go to Gilgal to renew the kingdom. They make Saul king there and offer peace offerings. The people of Israel rejoice.

## 12. Samuel's Farewell Address

Samuel gives a speech announcing the end of his judgment over Israel (though he will remain a prophet), and the beginning of kingship. The people testify to the integrity of his life as a judge. He recounts how the Lord appointed Moses and Aaron to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, but then the people forgot the Lord and were sold into the hand of Sisera, the Philistines, and the king of Moab. He recounts how Israel repented, and the Lord sent judges to rescue them. He recounts how the Ammonites came to fight them, and how they wanted a king when the Lord was already their king, and how the Lord gave them a king anyway. He urges them and their king to follow the Lord's commandments, and warns them of the consequences of not doing so. He calls upon the Lord to bring thunder and rain to prove to them they have sinned in asking for a king, and the Lord does so (during the wheat harvest when it was not supposed to rain), and the people fear the Lord. The people ask Sameul to pray for them and he says that although they have sinned, they shall not turn away from the Lord. He says, "Do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are empty." He tells them the Lord will not forsake his people and that he will continue to pray for them and provide spiritual guidance. He urges them to be faithful to the Lord, lest they and their king be swept away.

## 13. Saul Fights the Philistines

After two years as king, Saul gathers three thousand men. Two thousand go with Saul to Michmash (south of Bethel) and one thousand of those men go with his son Jonathan to Gibeah where they defeat the Philistines. Saul blows the trumpet for their victory and they all go to Gilgal. A large number of Philistines go to fight Israel and camp at Michmash. Israel fears them and *they hide themselves* in caves, holes, rocks, tombs, and cisterns, and some flee to Gilead. Saul waits seven days like Samuel told him to do, but Samuel doesn't show up. He gets impatient and he offers a burnt offering and a peace offering himself, breaking the Lord's commands. Samuel arrives and finds out what he did, tells him he has done foolishly. Saul doesn't repent, but tries to justify his actions, and Samuel tells him his kingdom shall not continue since he is not following the commands of the Lord. The people go to Gibeah, Saul numbers them at 600. The Philistines send three companies, one to Shaul, one to Beth-horon, and one toward the border near the Valley of Zeboim. Only Saul and Jonathan have weapons because the Philistines monopolized production of them.

## 14a. Jonathan Defeats the Philistines

Eli's great grandson Ahijah is acting as chaplain and was overseeing the ark, which they brought with them. Jonathan and the man who carries his armor sneak away to the Philistines garrison. They arrive between two rocky crags called Bozez (the gleaming one) and Seneh (the thorny one). Jonathan says that if the Philistines tell them to approach the garrison, it will be a sign from God that they will be delivered into their hand (Jonathan shows trust in God). The men tell them to come up and Jonathan and the armor carrier defeat the 20 Philistines in the garrison. This sends the Philistines into a panic. Saul's watchmen see men dispersing, and Saul calls in Ahijah with the ark, and as he is speaking to him, he panics and rushes into battle (Saul is acting on his own impulses and fears). After that, the Israelites rally together and drive the Philistines away. The Lord saves Israel once again, despite Saul's rash decision-making.

## 14b. Saul's Rash Vow

Saul is feeling the pressures of war so he makes a rash vow cursing anyone who eats before the evening and before he is avenged on his enemies. Jonathan was out defeating the Philistines, so he doesn't hear the vow. While they are in the forest they are sluggish and Jonathan eats some honey and feels much better. One of the men tells him about the vow, but Jonathan seems unconcerned because he says his father has troubled the land, and he suspects they will feel better after eating. After defeating the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, the people are so hungry they begin eating meat with blood in it (breaking the Lord's commands). Saul finds out and builds his first altar so they can prepare the meat properly. Saul wants to plunder the Philistines, but the priest says they should consult with God. Saul asks God if he should go out and plunder the Philistines, but God doesn't answer him. He assumes this is because of sin in the camp and threatens to kill the sinner (his pride is taking over). They cast lots and land on his son Jonathan, who confesses he ate honey in the forest. Jonathan repents and agrees to die for his unintentional sin, but the people step in for him and defend him because he saved them from the Philistines (they see that God has spoken more clearly through his victory than Saul's rash oath).

## 14c. Saul Fights Israel's Enemies

Saul fights against all enemies (Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, the Philistines, and the Amalekites) with Abner as commander. There was fighting all the days of Saul, and he recruits anyone who is strong and valiant.

## 15. The Lord Rejects Saul

The Lord commands Israel to devote the Amalekites to complete destruction, but Saul spares the king (Agag) and plunders their livestock to offer as offerings. The Lord tells Samuel he regrets appointing Saul as king because he broke his commands. Samuel goes to meet Saul, and it is told to him that Saul has made a monument for himself in Carmel (in Judah, south of Hebron) and went to Gilgal. When Samuel arrives, Saul tells him he has fulfilled the commands of the Lord. Samuel questions him about the livestock. Saul blames the people and says the livestock is for sacrifices. Samuel reminds him he is king and tells him obeying the Lord is better than sacrifice, and that the Lord has rejected him as king. Saul admits he sinned and tries to get Samuel to stay, but he refuses. As Samuel is leaving, Saul reaches for Samuel's robe and tears it. Samuel tells Saul the Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from him this day. Saul demands that Samuel honor him and calls the Lord his God. Samuel stays with Saul. Samuel kills Agag himself. Samuel goes to Ramah and Saul goes to his home in Gibeah, and Samuel doesn't see Saul until the day of his death. Samuel grieves over Saul, and the Lord regrets making him king.

## Downfall of Saul

* * *

## 16a. Rise of David – David Anointed King

The Lord tells Samuel to stop grieving and tells him to see Jesse the Bethlehemite (descendant of Perez, son of Obed, and David's father) for he has chosen a king. Samuel arrives with a sacrifice and invites Jesse and his sons. He sees Jesse's son Eliab is handsome, but the Lord tells him he sees the heart unlike man who sees outward appearance. Jesse has seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel tells him they are not who the Lord has chosen. Jesse says his youngest son David (name means beloved) remains, and sends for him. The Lord says he is the one, and Samuel anoints him. The Spirit of the Lord rushes upon David, and Samuel returns home to Ramah.

## 16b. David in Saul's Service

Saul receives judgment from the Lord for his actions, and one of his servants tells him to find a man who can play the lyre so that he can be well. They send for David, and Saul loves him. He becomes Saul's armor bearer. Whenever Saul is tormented, David plays the lyre and Saul is refreshed.

## 17. David and Goliath

The Philistines come up against Israel at Socoh in Judah (west of Bethlehem), and camp between Socoh and Azekah (northwest of Socoh) in Ephes-dammim. Israel, who were camped in the Valley of Elah (north of Azekah), came out to battle the Philistines. A champion (a man who steps out to fight between two battle lines) named Goliath, who is almost ten feet tall and has the best armament one could obtain, tells Israel that if he is defeated, the Philistines will be their servants, but if he defeats them, Israel shall be their servants. Israel is greatly afraid. Jesse tells David to bring his brothers Eliab, Abinadab, and Shammah (who were in battle) some grain and bread, and to bring the commander some cheese. When David arrives, he hears about Goliath and asks what shall be done for the man who kills him. He is told the king will enrich the man who defeats him, and give him his daughter. Eliab is angry at David for even inquiring. David tells Saul that he will defeat Goliath. Saul doesn't believe him because David is young. David tells Saul that he has killed lions and bears, and that the Lord who delivered him from their paws shall deliver him from the hand of Goliath. They put David in armor, but he says he hasn't tested them, so he removes the armor and takes five stones and his sling. He comes up against Goliath, and tells him, "You come to me with a sword and a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord." He slings a rock into Goliath's head, takes his sword, kills him, then cuts off his head. Israel defeats the Philistines as far as Gath and Ekron (west of Azekah). Saul asks who David is, and Abner finds him and brings him to Saul. David arrives with Goliath's head and tells him he is the son of Jesse.

## 18. Saul's Jealousy of David

Jonathan has great respect for David. He makes a covenant with him and gives him his armor and sword. David is successful and well-respected in Israel. Women begin to sing "Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands." This angers Saul and his jealousy grows. Saul tries to kill David with a spear twice, but David evades him. David continues to have success as the Lord was with him, and Saul's anger and jealousy only grows. Saul wants David to fall at the hand of the Philistines, so he offers for his daughter Merab to be David's wife. He asks humbly, "Who am I…that I should be the son-in-law to the king?" Merab is given to Adriel the Meholathite instead (Saul defaults on his promise to give his daughter to the man who killed Goliath). Saul then offers his daughter Michal and asks David for 100 foreskins of the Philistines in return, hoping he will be defeated (not only hoping he gets killed, but knowing his daughter practices idolatry and hoping she can lead him away from the Lord). David kills 200 Philistines and brings the foreskins to Saul. Saul sees the Lord is with David, that Michal loves David, and that David is very successful and highly respected. Saul becomes David's enemy.

## 19. Saul Tries to Kill David

Saul looks to have Jonathan and his servants kill David, but Jonathan warns David and tells his father he would be a great sin to kill David as he saved Israel from the Philistines. Saul backs off and David comes back to Saul's presence. David defeats the Philistines once again. He comes back and begins playing the lyre and Saul tries to spear him again. Saul sends men to watch David so that he may kill him in the morning, but Michal helps him escape through the window, and puts a pillow in his bed to trick them. When Saul asks for David, he finds out he fled to Samuel at Ramah. David tells Samuel what Saul did to him, and Samuel and David go to Naioth (a shepherds camp). Saul sends messengers to get David, but the Spirit of God comes upon them and the prophesy with the prophets. He sends two more groups of messengers and they begin to prophesy just as before. Saul finally goes himself, and begins to prophesy. He strips off his clothes (symbolizing how he was humbled by the Lord) and it is again said, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" This time the implication being the throne is being stripped from him.

## 20. Jonathan Warns David

David leaves Naioth and goes to Jonathan and asks him what he has done to make his father want to kill him. Jonathan tells David he will warn him if his father is out to kill him. David tells Jonathan that he will hide in the field on the new moon, and Jonathan will tell Saul David went to Bethlehem for a yearly sacrifice. The plan is that if this angers Saul, they know he is out to harm him. Jonathan and David make a covenant. Jonathan agrees to the plan and says that if his father is not angry, he will shoot three arrows beside where he is hiding and send a boy to gather them, and if his father is angry, he will shoot the arrows beyond where he is hiding. On the first day, Saul assumes David's absence is due to him being unclean. On the second day, he asks Jonathan where he is, and Jonathan tells him he went to Bethlehem. Saul gets angry, curses Jonathan, and throws a spear at him. Jonathan goes out and shoots the arrows past the place where David is hiding. Jonathan tells the boy to gather them and go back to the city. David and Jonathan weep, Jonathan says the Lord is between them, and David leaves.

## 21. David Flees to Nob and Gath

David flees to Nob (between Jerusalem and Gibeah which became a priestly city after the destruction of Shiloh) and meets Ahimelech the priest (great grandson of Eli), who asks him why he is alone. Doeg the Edomite (chief of Saul's herdsmen) was detained there, so David lies and says he is on official business from the king (shows distrust in God's promise to make him king). He asks for bread, and Ahimelech tells him he doesn't have common bread, only the bread of the Presence. David tells him he has abstained from sex and is clean, so Ahimelech gives him the holy bread (breaking one of the laws). David asks Ahimelech for a weapon, and he gives him the sword of Goliath. David flees to Gath and Achish the king and his servants recognize him. He pretends he is insane so they send him away.

## 22. Saul Kills the Priests at Nob

David flees to the cave of Adullam (halfway between Gath and Bethlehem), his family and anyone who was in distress comes to meet him (400 men), and he becomes commander over them. David goes to Mizpeh of Moab and asks the king to let his parents stay with him (Ruth was a Moabite, and Saul is an enemy of the Mobites). They stay there and David stays in a stronghold (perhaps in Masada on the western shore of the Dead Sea). The prophet Gad tells David to leave and go into the land of Judah, so he goes out into the forest of Hereth. At Gibeah, Doeg tells Saul that he saw David at Nob. The king summons all the priests of Nob and asks Ahimelech why he has helped David who has "risen against him". Ahimelech says he didn't know of any such thing. Saul tells his servants to kill the priests, but they won't do it. He asks Doeg to do it and he complies. 85 priests die and Saul puts Nob to the sword (men, women, children, and animals). Ahimielech's son Abiathar escapes and flees to David and tells him the news. David tells him to stay with him for safekeeping saying, "He who seeks my life seeks your life."

## 23. Saul Pursues David

The Philistines attack Keilah (south of Adullam), David prays, and God tells David he should go and fight them. David has 600 men, and they are scared, but the Lord tells David he has delivered the Philistines into his hand. They defeat the Philistines and save Keilah. Saul finds out David is at Keilah, David prays, and the Lord says Saul is after him and that the men of the city will surrender him (even after he saved them). David and his men flee Keilah into the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh (southeast of Hebron). Jonathan goes to David and tells him he will be king over Israel, that his father knows this too, and that Jonathan shall be next to him. They make a covenant and Jonathan returns home. The Ziphites tell Saul they will surrender David, and Saul tells them to find where he is hiding. They find out he is in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah (south of Ziph), and Saul goes after him. Saul was on one side of the mountain, and David was on the other. Saul gets word the Philistines are attacking, so he returns (an event caused by the Lord to save David at the last minute). The place is called The Rock of Escape. David goes to the strongholds of Engedi (east of Ziph, an oasis on the western shore of the Dead Sea).

## 24. David Spares Saul's Life

Saul returns and finds out David is in the wilderness of Engedi and takes 3,000 men to find him (five times as many men as David, which shows his paranoia). Saul goes to relieve himself in the cave where David is hiding, and he has him cornered. David cuts off the corner of his robe, but then tells his men the Lord forbade him to kill his anointed. He lets Saul go and David goes after him and tells him he means no harm to Saul, and the fact that he spared his life should prove his innocence before God. He says he will let the Lord judge between them. Saul weeps and admits David is more righteous as he repaid him good whereas Saul repaid him evil. Saul acknowledges David will be king, and has David promise not to destroy the house of his father. David promises and then goes up to the stronghold (David still doesn't trust Saul).

## 25a. The Death of Samuel

Samuel dies, and all of Israel gathers to mourn his death. They bury him at his house in Ramah.

## 25b. David and Abigail

David goes to the wilderness of Paran, and remembers a very wealthy man (and fellow Judahite, a Calebite) named Nabal (translation: foolish) in Moan whose business was in Carmel (not the mountain, a Judahite between Ziph and Moan) who had a very "discerning and beautiful" wife named Abigail. David and his men had helped and protected his shepherds in Carmel. David sends 10 men to greet him peacefully while he is shearing his sheep (a time of festivity and work) to develop a relationship and ask for provisions. Nabal responds rudely and says, "Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse?" Not only does he refuse to share his food, of which he has much (3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats), he is very condescending. This angers David who makes a vow to kill all the men in his household and rallies 400 men with their swords to go and kill Nabal. One of Nabal's servants tells Abigail the situation, and she prepares a huge amount of provisions (200 loaves of bread, 200 cakes of figs, etc.) and without telling Nabal goes with her servants to meet David. She falls before him, says, "On me alone my lord, be the guilt," and reasons with him saying, "the Lord has restrained you from bloodguilt." She gives him the food and asks for forgiveness. David responds by saying, "Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt." David sends her home peacefully and grants her petition (this breaks his vow, but it was a vow of sin, so better to break the vow than to kill). She goes home and Nabal is drunk so she waits until morning and then tells him what happened. When he hears the news he has a heart attack and dies 10 days later. David finds out and asks her to be his wife (she says yes, which to her credit says a lot because she gives up her wealthy estate to be with David who moves around the Desert, she trusts him). David also takes Ahinoam of Jezreel as his wife. Saul gave his first wife, Michal, to Palti, the son of Laish of Gallim.

## 26. David Spares Saul Again

The Ziphites go to Saul at Gibeah and tell him David is hiding on the hill of Hachilah (east of Jeshimon / Engedi). Saul pursues him with Abner and his army. David's spies find out where he is, and David goes with Ahimelech (Hittite) and Abishai (David's nephew) to the place where he is camped. David and Abishai go into the camp and find Saul sleeping with his spear next to him in the ground. Abishai asks to kill Saul, but David stops him and says, "Who can put out his hand against the anointed and be guiltless?" David has faith the Lord will execute judgment on Saul. David takes Saul's spear and water and goes to the other side of the hill and calls to Abner. He tells Abner he is guilty of not protecting the king, and Saul hears David. David tells Saul he spared his life and asks why he pursues him. He says if it is not the Lord who sent him, but man, then he has sinned. Saul admits to his sin and repents. David says before the Lord that since he has spared Saul, so too shall Saul spare David. Saul blesses David and returns home.

## 27. David Flees to the Philistines

To get away from Saul, David, Ahinoam, Abigail, and David's 600 men and their families flee to the land of the Philistines and live with the king of Gath, Achish. He asks Achish for some land, and he is given Ziklag (remained the land of the kings of Judah). He lives there for 1 year and 4 months. David and his men begin to raid the towns on the edge of Philistia (but David keeps the spoils, not devoting them to destruction as God commanded) and when Achish would ask about his raids, he would tell him he raided the Israelites. This lie gains him a lot of respect with Achish who says, "He shall always be my servant."

## 28. Saul and the Medium of En-dor

The Philistines prepare to attack Israel. David is expected to fight with the Philistines and becomes the bodyguard of Achish for life. The Philistines camp at Shunem (north of the Jezreel Valley). Saul is very frightened and the Lord is not answering him, so he disguises himself and seeks out a medium in En-dor (northeast of Shunem) by night, even though he had put all the medium and necromancers out of the land as the Lord commanded. The medium calls up Samuel, recognizes Saul, and cries out. He tells her not to be afraid. Saul tells Samuel the Lord is not answering her so he has called to him with a medium to see what to do. Samuel reminds Saul the Lord has turned from him and has torn the kingdom out of his hand. He says the Lord will give them into the hand of the Philistines, and he and sons will die. Saul becomes even more terrified and refuses to eat. The woman prepares a meal for him and she and his servants urge him to eat. He and his servants eat and return home.

## 29. The Philistines Reject David

The Philistines gather at Aphek, and the commanders of the Philistines worry that David will betray them in battle, so they tell Achish to send him back to Ziklag. Achish tells David although he has been honest, blameless, and has done no wrong (even though we know he lied), he must return back. David and his men return back early in the morning. The Philistines go up to Jezreel.

## 30. David's Wives Are Captured

David and his men arrive at Ziklag only to find out that the Amalekites have captured everyone in the city (including Ahinoam and Abigail) and have burned the city with fire and plundered it. David becomes distressed, and the people want to stone him because they are bitter. David strengthens himself in the Lord and calls Abiathar. David aks the Lord if he should pursue the Amalekites, and the Lord says yes and that he shall overtake them. David and his 600 men set out and arrive at the brook Besor (southwest of Ziklag) where 200 men stay behind because they are exhausted. They find an Egyptian who was a servant of the Amalekites, feed him, and ask him what happened. He tells them that he felt sick and the Amalekites left him behind when they went to raid Ziklag. David asks him to take them to the Amalekites and he agrees as long as they spare his life. When they arrive, David defeats the Amalekites, saves the people, and takes the spoils. They return to the 200 men at the brook Besor and the men want to keep the spoils for themselves and not give any to the ones who stayed behind. David tells them that the share of the ones stayed behind will be the same as the ones who fought. This becomes a statute in Israel. When the arrive at Ziklag, he even shares the spoils with his friends, the elders of Judah.

## 31. The Death of Saul

The Philistines defeat Israel at Mount Gilboa (south of Jezreel) and kill Saul's sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua. Archers badly wound Saul, and he asks his armor-bearer to kill him lest he die by the hand of the Philistines. The armor-bearer refuses, so Saul falls on his own sword and dies. His armor-bearer also falls on his own sword. The Israelites in the area abandon their cities and the Philistines take over. They find Saul and his sons, cut off his head, take his armor, tell the news throughout the land, and put his body and his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth. The people of Jabesh-gilead hear about this and send valiant men to recover the bodies of Saul and his sons. They burn their bodies in Jabesh and bury them under the tamarisk tree and fast 7 days.
