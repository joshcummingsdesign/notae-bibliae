## Genealogies

* * *

## 1. Adam to Jacob

This section traces the genealogy from Adam to Seth to Noah to Shem to Terah to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob. It also lists the descendants of Esau and the kings and chiefs of Edom.

## 2. A Genealogy of David

This section traces the genealogy from Jacob to Judah to Perez to Hezron to Ram to Boaz to Obed to Jesse to David. It also traces the lineage and history of the people, places, and tribes that came from the line of Judah including Shelah (the oldest surviving son of Judah) and Zerah (Judah's other son with Tamar).

## 3. Descendants of David

This section traces the genealogy of David, his son Solomon, and the kings of Judah. Just as Judah heads the genealogies of Israel (though Reuben was the firstborn), the line of David's descendants heads the genealogy of Judah as the focus of hope and expectation.

## 4. Descendants of Judah and Simeon

This section completes the listing of the descendants of Judah and includes other descendants of Perez, and descendants of Shelah. It describes Jabez (translation pain, because his mother bore him in pain) as more honorable than his brothers. Jabez called to the Lord asking to enlarge his border and keep him from harm so that it won't bring him pain (implies that he may have needed saving from himself), and God answered his prayer. It then lists the descendants of Simeon next, as their land was within Judah. It describes how the tribe of Simeon is shrinking (as prophesied by Jacob). It describes how the people of Simeon journeyed to the entrance of Gedor (probably Gerar—between Jerusalem and Hebron) to seek pasture for their flocks and drove out the people of the land there. It describes how 500 men of the Simeonites under the command of Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel (sons of Ishi) went to Mount Seir and defeated the Amalekites and began to live there.

## 5. Transjordan Tribes (Reuben, Gad, Manasseh)

This section describes how Reuben forfeited his birthright as Jacob's firstborn to Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) due to his sin against his father. It acknowledges that even though Judah was a strong tribe from which David (described here as a chief) arose, the birthright belonged to Joseph. It goes through a fragmentary genealogy of Reuben's line, and describes how the Reubenites expanded into Gilead, and how in the days of Saul they defeated the Hagrites (descendants of Hagar). It then lists some of the descendants of Gad in Bashan in the days of Jotham (king of Judah) and Jeroboam (king of Israel). It describes how the Transjourdan tribes waged war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab, and cried out to God in battle, and how God delivered them into their hand because they trusted in Him. It then lists the heads of the half-tribe of Manasseh who lived between Bashan and Mount Hermon. The section ends by describing how they broke faith and whored after other gods, and Tiglath-pileser (king of Assyria) took the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile and brought them to Halah, Habor, Harah, and the river Gozan (northwest of Babylon).

## 6. Descendants of Levi

This section traces the genealogy of Levi. Just as Judah heads the genealogies of Israel, Levi is placed in the literary and spiritual center of the genealogies of Israel. It traces from Levi to Kohath to Amram to Aaron to Eleazar to Phinehas to Azariah who served as priest in the house that Solomon built in Jerusalem. It traces from Azariah to Jehozadak who went into exile when the Lord sent Judah and Jerusalem into exile by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar (king of Babylon). It traces from Levi to Kohath to Izhar to Korah to Ebiasaph to Elkanah to Samuel. It explains how David put Heman (Kohath, Samuel's grandson, Joel's son), Asaph (Gershom, descendant of Shimei, stood to the right of Heman), and Ethan (Merari, descendant of Mushi, stood to the left of Heman) in charge of the service of song in the tabernacle and then in Jerusalem where Solomon built the house of the Lord. It traces the Aaronic priests, who were in charge of offerings and making atonement for Israel. Finally, the Levitical cities are summarized with some slight changes (an underline means it's a city of refuge, an asterisk means it was not mentioned but is numbered):

## 7. Northern Tribes (Issachar, Benjamin, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Asher)

This section lists the genealogies of the northern tribes including part of Benjamin that belonged to the older northern kingdom of Israel. The section on Naphtali is extremely short, and Dan and Zebulun are not listed. It traces from Ephraim to Beriah to Rephah to Nun to Joshua. The number of fighting men for Asher decreases significantly since Moses' day.

## 8. Descendants of Benjamin / A Genealogy of Saul

This section traces the genealogy of Benjamin. Just as Judah heads the genealogies and Levi is placed in the center of the genealogies, Benjamin is placed at the end of the genealogies of Israel as they are part of the core of the old southern kingdom along with Judah (the Judah-Levi-Benjamin structure is completed here). It traces from Benjamin to Ner (Abiel / Jeiel) to Kish to Saul. It then lists the descendants of Jonathan (Saul's son).

## 9. A Genealogy of the Returned Exiles

This section recounts that Judah was taken into exile in Babylon because of their breach of faith, and lists the people involved in the resettlement of Israel after the exile. The first among them were the Levites. Some of the people of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Menasseh lived in Jerusalem after the exile. From Judah there was Uthai (descendant of Perez), Asiah (descendant of Shelah), and Jeuel (descendant of Zerah). From Benjamin there was Sallu, Ibneiah, and Meshullam. The priests were Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin, Azariah, Adaiah, and Maasai, and their numbers have grown significantly since earlier days. The Levitical singers and musicians include Mattaniah (descendant of Asaph) and Obadiah (descendant of Jeduthun). Other singers lived in the villages of the Netophathites near Bethlehem. David and Samuel appointed 212 Levitical gatekeepers under the authority of Phinehas to safeguard the sanctity and security of the temple and to be in charge of the food, utensils, and supplies used in the daily sacrifices.

## Stories About David

* * *

## 10. The Death of Saul and His Sons

The Philistines defeat Israel and strike down Saul's sons on Mount Gilboa. Archers wound Saul, and Saul asks his armor-bearer to kill him lest he die by the hand of the Philistines. His armor-bearer won't do it, so Saul and his armor-bearer fall upon their own swords. The Philistines take Saul's head and put it in the temple of Dagon, but valiant men from Jabesh-gilead recover it, bury it under the oak in Jabesh, and fast for 7 days. Saul dies because he did not keep the commands of the Lord and because he sought a medium instead of seeking guidance from the Lord. The Lord turns the kingdom over to David.

## 11. David Anointed King

All Israel comes to David at Hebron and says, "Behold, we are your bone and flesh. In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel." The Lord says to David, "You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel." David makes a covenant with the elders of Israel, and he is anointed king according to the word of the Lord by Samuel. David and all Israel go to Jerusalem where the Jebusites have a stronghold. David takes the stronghold, the stronghold of Zion. His nephew Joab becomes commander. David lives in the stronghold and it is called the city of David. He builds the city from the Millo (translation "the fill") in a complete circuit, and Joab repairs the rest of the city. David becomes greater and greater because the Lord of hosts is with him. David had mighty men who gave him strong support in his kingdom. Jashobeam, chief of 3, killed 300 men with a spear. Eleazar defeated the Philistines at Pas-dammim in Judah. Three of the 30 chief men broke through the camp of the Philistines at Bethlehem to draw David water from the well, but David poured out the water to the Lord out of respect for the men who risked their lives to bring it. David's nephew Abishai was commander of the 30, and killed 300 men with a spear. Benaiah struck down two heroes of Moab, went into a lion pit in the snow, struck down a 7-foot-tall Egyptian with his own spear, and became David's bodyguard. The other mighty men are listed here.

## 12. The Mighty Men Join David

Before his reign in Hebron, David took refuge from Saul in various strongholds in the Judean desert, then in Ziklag. When David was in Ziklag, there was growing support for him from Saul's own tribe of Benjamin, some of the best of his warriors. During an earlier period (possibly Adullam or Engedi) David received support from some of the most skillful and heroic Gadites. Some of the men of Benjamin and Judah go David and David tells them, "If you have come to me in friendship to help me, my heart will be joined to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God of our fathers see and rebuke you." The Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of 30, and he says, "We are yours, O David…Peace be to you." Some of the men of Manasseh joined David when the Philistines went to battle Saul. David's army became "like an army of God." The numbers of troops from each tribe are listed. All of the men of war came to Hebron "with a whole heart" to make David king over Israel. The rest of Israel were "of a single mind" to make David king over Israel. There was a three-day festival celebrating the covenant made before the Lord between David and the elders. God gave the nation peace, unity, prosperity, and joy under David's leadership.

## 13. The Ark Brought from Kiriath-Jearim

David consults the Lord and all of Israel, and they agree to gather all the people and bring the ark from Kiriath-jearim (in Judah, northwest of Jerusalem), for they "did not seek it in the days of Saul." They put the ark on a new cart from Abinadab (instead of having Levites carry it on poles as the law commands), Uzzah and Ahio drive the cart, and the people celebrate. Uzzah puts his hand on the ark when the oxen stumble and is struck down by the Lord. The place is called Perez-uzza (translation: breaking out against Uzzah). Out of fear, David brings the ark to Obed-edom (a Gattite, person from Gath, possibly a Philistine) for three months, and the Lord blesses his household.

## 14. David's Wives and Children

Hiram, king of Tyre, brings cedar trees, masons, and carpenters to build David's house, and David knows that the Lord has established him as king over Israel. He took more wives in Jerusalem and had more sons and daughters. The Philistines find out David is anointed as king and go to attack him at the Valley of Rephaim. David inquires of God, and God tells him he will deliver them into his hand. David defeats them and says, "The Lord has broken through my enemies before me like a breaking flood." The place is called Baal-perazim (means the Lord of breaking through). David takes their idols and burns them. The Philistines raid again, and God tells David when he hears the sound of marching from the tops of the balsam trees, to go into battle, for God has gone out before him to strike them down. David strikes them down from Gibeon to Gezer, and becomes famous throughout the land.

## 15. The Ark Brought to Jerusalem

David builds the city of David in Jerusalem and prepares a tent for the ark. This time, he has Levites carry it on their shoulders with poles as the law commands. He summons the Levites: Kohath with Uriel as chief, Mereri with Asaiah as chief, Gershom with Joel as chief. The other chiefs are Shemaiah, Eliel, and Aminadab. The priests are Zadok and Abiathar. The Kohahthites are responsible for carrying the ark. David appoints Heman, Asaph, and Ethan as singers to worship before the ark. He also appoints gatekeepers for the ark, including Obed-edom (not a Levite, but the Lord blessed his household because the ark remained in his house for three months). They bring the ark out of the house of Obed-edom rejoicing, and they sacrifice seven bulls and seven rams. All the men wore fine linen robes and David wore a linen ephod. The ark is brought to the city of David. Michal, Saul's daughter and David's first wife, looks out the window and sees King David dancing and celebrating, and she despises him with all her heart.

## 16. The Ark Placed in a Tent

The ark is brought to the ten in the city of David and they offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. David blesses the people in the name of the Lord, and gives each person a portion of bread, meat, and cake with raisins. Levites are appointed as ministers to worship before the ark: Asaph as chief and to sound the cymbals; Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithaiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obed-edom to play harps and lyres; Beniah and Jahaziel as priests and to blow the trumpets. David appoints the first thanksgiving song to be sung by Asaph and his brothers. The song of thanks here is the Chronicler's composite of Psalms 96, 105, and 106 with some slight variations. Asaph and his brothers are to minister regularly before the ark, and Obed-edom and Hosah are to be gatekeepers. Zadok and his brothers are to minister at the tabernacle in Gibeon and do all that the law commanded them. Heman and Jeduthun are to sing and lead worship, and Jeduthun's sons are to be gatekeepers. Israel departs, and David goes home.

## 17. The Lord's Covenant with David

David acknowledges that he lives in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is in a tent. God delivers David his message through prophet Nathan saying, "It is not you who will build me a house to dwell in." God says that he has not dwelled in a house in all of Israel's history. God recounts how he brought David up from a shepherd to a prince, cut off all his enemies, and brought Israel peace in the promised land. God says that instead of David building Him a house, He will build David a house, and will establish his throne forever. God says, "I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you, but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever." David humbly prays a prayer of gratitude saying, "Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?" He says, "There is one like you, O Lord, and there is no God besides you." He acknowledges how God established Israel as his people forever, and that now He is establishing David's line forever. His prayer ends with, "Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you, for it is you, O Lord, who have blessed, and it is blessed forever."

## 18a. David's Defeats his Enemies

After David defeats the Philistines, he takes Gath and its villages. He defeats Moab and the Moabites become his servants. David defeats Hadadezer, king of Zobah-Hamath, while Hadadezer is on his way to set up his monument at the river Euphrates. He takes 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He hamstrings all the horses, but keeps enough for 100 chariots. The Syrians of Damascus come to help Hadadezer and David defeats them (22,000 men), puts garrisons in Syria of Demascus, and the Syrians become David's servants. David brings the shields of gold of Hadadezer to Jerusalem. He takes bronze from Tibhath and Cun (cities of Hadadezer), and Solmon makes the bronze sea (large basin in the temple at Jerusalem) and the pillars and the vessels of bronze with it. Tou (Toi), the king of Hamath (on the northern border of Zobah), sends his son Hadoram (Joram) to bring David silver, gold, and bronze because they were at war with Hadadezer. David dedicates all the precious metals from his victories (Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek) to the Lord. David's nephew Abishai strikes down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt (east of the Dead Sea), puts garrisons in Edom, and the Edomites become David's servants. The Lord gives David victory wherever he goes.

## 18b. David's Administration

David brings justice and equity to Israel. His nephew Joab was commander of the army, Jehoshaphat (son of Alihud) was recorder, Zadok (son of Ahitub) and Ahimelech (son of Abiathar) were priests, Shavsha (Seriah) was secretary, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada and one of David's mighty men) was in charge of the Cherethites and the Pelethites (foreigners who made up the king's bodyguards), and David's sons were chief officials in the service of the king.

## 19. The Ammonites Disgrace David's Men

Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, dies and Hanun, his son, takes over. David sends servants out to console Hanun since he was on good terms with Nahash, but Hanun's princes tell him they are spies and Hanun shaves them and cuts off their garments in the middle at their hips to humiliate them and sends them away. David has his men remain at Jericho until their beards grow back. As tension is rising, the Ammonites hire soldiers from Mesopotamia (from Aram-maacah and Zobah in Syria) and encamp at Medeba (in Ammon). David sends Joab and his mighty men to Ammon, and the Ammonites and Syrians draw up against them in battle. Joab and his men are surrounded, so he arrays them against the Syrians, and arrays his brother Abishai against the Ammonites. Joab says, "Be strong, and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to Him." The Sryians and the Ammonites flee, and Joab and his men return to Jerusalem. Hadadezer sends his commander Shophach (Shobach) and his men to Helam (northern Transjordan) to attack Israel, and David and his men defeat them and kill Shophach. Hadadezer's men make peace with David and become subject to him. The Syrians no longer wish to aid the Ammonites.

## 20a. The Capture of Rabbah

In the springtime, when it was customary for the king to go out to battle, David stays in Jerusalem and Joab defeats the Ammonite city of Rabbah. David takes the crown of their king (75 pounds of gold and precious stone) and it was placed on his head. David a great amount of spoil out of the city and puts the people to labor. He does this with all the Ammonites cities. David and the people return to Jerusalem.

## 20b. Philistine Giants Killed

David and his servants defeat the descendants of the giants of Gath. War breaks out with the Philistines at Gezer. Shibbecai the Hushathite strikes down Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants, and the Philistines are subdued. War breaks out again with the Philistines, and Elhanan, the son of Jair, strikes down Lahmi, the brother of Goliath. War breaks out again at Gath, and Jonathan, son of David's brother Shimea, strikes down a "man of great stature" who taunted Israel, descended from the giants, and had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.

## 21. David's Census Brings Pestilence

God allows Satan (the adversary) to stand against Israel and incite David to take a census of all Israel. David gives in, most likely to see his military potential, which is prideful and shows lack of trust in the Lord. Additionally, he did not take a ransom for each person as the law required. Joab warns him, but David insists, so Joab goes throughout all Israel and comes back to Jerusalem. He counts 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and 470,000 men in Judah who drew the sword, but does not include Levi or Benjamin in the count because he knows the king's orders for the census are morally wrong. David realizes this is a sin and repents. God relays through the prophet Gad that there will either be three years of famine, three months of devastation by the sword of their enemies, or three days of pestilence from the sword of the angel of the Lord, and David is to choose. David says, "Let me fall into the hand of the Lord, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man." The Lord sends pestilence on Israel and 70,000 men fall. The angel goes to Jerusalem to destroy it, but the Lord has him relent there. David sees the angel by the threshing floor of Ornan (a.k.a. Araunah) the Jebusite, and he and the elders clothe in sackcloth and fall on their faces. David prays to the Lord that since he is responsible for the sin, the people should be spared, and the burden should fall on him and his house (sacrificing himself for the people, reminiscent of Aaron standing between the people). The Lord has Gad tell David to raise an altar (for sacrifices) there instead (reminiscent of God providing a ram in the place of Isaac), so David asks to buy Ornan's land to build the altar, and Ornan offers to simply give him the land. David insists on paying, saying, "I will not take for the Lord what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing." He buys the site for 600 shekels of gold ("the site" most likely being the land on Mount Moriah—the place where God led Abraham to sacrifice Isaac) and builds an altar there. David presents burnt offerings and peace offerings there, and the Lord answers him with fire from heaven upon the altar (signifying his approval that this will be the place of worship where He dwells). The tabernacle is currently stationed at Gibeon, and David is too fearful of the angel of the Lord to make his sacrifices there. The Lord accepts David's burnt offerings and peace offerings at the new site, and the plague comes to an end.

## 22. Solomon Charged to Build the Temple

David says, "Here shall be the house of the Lord God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel." David gathers resident aliens to build the house of God, providing large quantities of precious metals and wood. The Sidonians and Tyrians bring large quantities of cedar to David. David wants the house of God to be exceedingly magnificent so that his inexperienced son Solomon would be recognized as he takes the throne. The Lord prevents David from building the house because he has shed so much blood, so David charges Solomon (name means peace) to build the temple. The Lord says he will give Israel peace in his days and keep to the Davidic covenant by establishing his house forever. David blesses Solomon and urges him to keep the commands of the Lord echoing what Moses said to Joshua, "Be strong and courageous. Fear not; do not be dismayed." He tells Solomon, "Arise and work! The Lord be with you!" David commands the leaders of Israel to help Solomon build the temple, saying, "Now set your mind and heart to seek the Lord your God. Arise and build the sanctuary of the Lord God, so that the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the Lord."

## 23. David Organizes the Levites

An aging David makes Solomon king over Israel and assembles all the leaders and the priests and the Levites. The Levites 30 years old and up are numbered, and the count is 38,000. David puts 24,000 of them in charge of the work of the temple, makes 6,000 of them judges and officers, makes 4,000 of them gatekeepers, and puts 4,000 of them in charge of worship. David organizes the Levites 20 years old and up in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi (Gershon, Kohath, and Merari) to work the service of the temple. David says, "The Lord, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and He dwells in Jerusalem forever." The Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle. The Levites are to stand every morning and evening to thank and praise the Lord, as well as during offerings and feasts.

## 24. David Organizes the Priests

From the house of Aaron, Eleazar and Ithamar were the two priestly houses (Nadab and Abihu died). David, with the help of Zadok (house of Eleazar) and Ahimelech (house of Ithamar), organizes the two houses into 24 divisions (two weeks of service for each division for a total of 48 weeks—a lunar calendar year). Eleazar gets 16 divisions since they are the larger house, and Ithamar gets 8. They alternate casting lots for each house, and the remaining 8 default to Eleazar. David, Zadok, and Ahimelech also cast lots for the duties of the heads of the remaining houses of the sons of Levi and their younger brothers.

## 25. David Organizes the Musicians

David and the chiefs of the service organize the musicians Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun and their sons into 24 divisions like the priests. Each division contains 12 musicians. Lots are cast for their duties. Asaph and his sons prophesied (which in this case means let the Spirit of God guide their singing) under the direction of the king. Jeduthun and his sons prophesied in thanksgiving and praise to the Lord. Heman was the king's seer (prophet), and he and his 14 sons and 3 daughters were musicians in the house of the Lord. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the direction of the king.

## 26. Divisions of the Gatekeepers

The divisions of the gatekeepers include the families of Meshelemiah (of Kohath), Obed-edom (the Philistine keeper of the ark), and Hosah (of Merari). They cast lots for their gates, and the east gate (the position of greatest responsibility, required 6 gatekeepers, leads to temple entrance) goes to Meshelemiah. The north gate goes to Zechariah (son of Meshelemiah). The south gate goes to Obed-edom. The west gate (gate of Shallecheth on the road that goes up) goes to Hosah. Ahijah (of Kohath) and Zetham and Joel (of Gershon) have charge of the treasuries of the house of God. Sebuel (grandson of Moses) is chief officer in charge of the treasuries. Shelomoth (of Kohath) and his brothers are in charge of the gifts that David and his officers, Samuel, and Saul and his officers had dedicated to the Lord. Chenaniah (of Izhar) and his sons are to serve outside of Jerusalem as officers and judges. Hashabiah (of Hebron) and his brothers are to oversee Israel west of the Jordan for the work of the Lord and service of the king. Jerijah (of Hebron) and his brothers are to oversee Israel east of the Jordan for everything pertaining to God and the affairs of the king.

## 27. Military Divisions

This section describes Israel's citizen militia of 12 divisions of 24,000 men each, each one doing a month's duty on rotation. Jashobeam (of Judah) is in charge of the first division in the first month. Dodai (of Benjamin) was in charge of the second. Benaiah (son of the chief priest Jehoiada) the third. Asahel (Joab's brother) was fourth. Shamhuth (Izrahite) the fifth. Ira (Tekoite) the sixth. Helez (of Ephraim) the seventh. Sibbecai (Hushathite) the eighth. Abiezer (of Benjamin) the ninth. Maharai (Zerahite) the tenth. Benaiah (of Ephraim) the eleventh. Heldai (of Judah) the twelfth. The next section lists the leaders of the tribes of Israel. Eliezer (son of Zichri) is chief of Reuben. Shephatiah (son of Maacah) is chief of Simeon. Hashabiah (son of Kemuel) is chief of Levi. Zadok is listed as chief of Aaron. Elihu (David's brother, a.k.a Eliab) is chief of Judah. Omri (son of Michael) is chief of Issachar. Ishmaiah (son of Obadiah) is chief of Zebulun. Jeremoth (son of Azriel) is chief of Naphtali. Hoshea (son of Azaziah) is chief of Ephraim. Joel (son of Pedaiah) is chief of Manasseh West. Iddo (son of Zechariah) is chief of Menasseh East. Jassiel (son of Abner) is chief of Benjamin. Azarel (son of Jeroham) is chief of Dan. This section also lists the 12 stewards of King David's property. David's uncle Jonathan was a counselor and a scribe. Jehiel (son of Hachmoni) attended the king's sons. Ahithophel was the king's counselor, but was succeeded by Jehoiada and Abiathar. Hushai was the king's friend. Joab was the commander of the king's army.

## 28. David's Charge to Solomon

David assembles all Israel to Jerusalem and announces that it was in his heart to build a house to the Lord, but the Lord forbade him to do it because he shed so much blood. He announces that the Lord chose Solomon to take the throne and to be his son, and that the Lord will establish his kingdom forever. David says the Lord chose Solomon to build his house. He urges the people to keep the commands of the Lord so they may possess the land and leave it for an inheritance to their children forever. He urges Solomon to serve the Lord with his whole heart, charges him to build the sanctuary, and gives him the detailed plans. David tells Solomon, "Be strong and courageous and do it. Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for the Lord God, even my God, is with you. He will not leave you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of the Lord is finished." David tells Solomon all the people he has organized are in his command.

## 29. Offerings for the Temple

David lists the items he has given freely for the house of the Lord, and asks who is willing to offer freely, thereby consecrating themself. The leaders of Israel all give freely and in abundance for the building of the house of the Lord. King David and all the people rejoice. David blesses the Lord in the presence of the assembly, acknowledging that all they have given is ultimately his, that riches and honor come from Him, and that He is the source of all strength. He prays the Spirit of the Lord will remain in the hearts of the people, and that Solomon may keep his commandments. The assembly blesses the Lord and offers offerings in abundance. They eat, drink, and rejoice. Solomon is anointed king for the second time, with Zadok as priest. The Lord makes Solomon very great, with majesty that had not been seen before in Israel. David ruled 40 years (7 years in Hebron, 33 years in Jerusalem). He dies at a good age, full of days, riches, and honor. His life was recorded in the Chronicles of Samuel, Nathan, and Gad. Solomon takes the throne.
