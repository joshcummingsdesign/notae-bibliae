## Synopsis

The story of the Judges (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shofetim" text="Shofetim" />*) of Israel and the tragedy that ensues when they turn away from God and do what is right in their own eyes.

## Israel Fails to Drive Out the Canaanites

* * *

## 1a. The Continuing Conquest of Canaan

After Joshua's death, Judah takes the lead in fighting against the Canaanites and rallies his brother Simeon to go with him. The Lord gives the Canaanites into their hands. They defeat 10,000 of them in Bezek, capture their king (Adoni-bezek), cut off his thumbs and big toes (a common war practice of the time to prevent the person from fighting again), and bring him to Jerusalem where he dies. Judah captures Jerusalem, and the Kenites (Jethro's descendants) join them and they go to Jericho. Judah and Simeon destroy Zephath which is named Hormah (meaning utter destruction). Judah captures Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron. Judah fails to drive out all the Canaanites because they have chariots of iron (i.e. they don't trust in the Lord). The tribe of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites in Jerusalem. The tribe of Joseph captures Bethel, but they spare a man who shows them the way to the city and he builds a Canaanite city called Luz.

## 1b. Failure to Complete the Conquest

Manasseh doesn't drive out Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo, but puts them to forced labor. Ephraim doesn't drive out Gezer. Zebulun doesn't drive out Kitron and Nahalol, but puts them to forced labor. Asher doesn't drive out Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob. Naphtali doesn't drive out Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath, but puts them to forced labor. The Amorites fight Dan, and Joseph rescues them, but they do not drive them out of Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but put them to forced labor.

## 2. Israel's Disobedience

The angel of the Lord goes from Gilgal to Bochim (meaning weepers) and tells the Israelites that they have not held up their end of the covenant and reminds them the Canaanites will be a thorn in their sides, and the people weep and offer sacrifices there. Joshua and all the elders of his generation have died, and the new generation of Israel does not know the Lord or what he has done for them. They start worshiping the Canaanite gods (Baal and Ashtoreth), and they fall victim to the Canaanites who plunder and oppress them. The Lord raises up judges who save them, but they continue on the path of sin. Each generation of Israel becomes more corrupt than the last. The Lord ceases to drive out Israel's enemies as a test of their character.

## Corruption of Israel's Judges

* * *

## 3a. 1st Judge: Othniel

The Lord leaves many Canaanite nations among Israel to test them, and the Israelites begin to intermarry with them and serve their gods. This angers God who sells the Israelites into slavery to the king of Mesopotamia (Cushan-rishathaim). After 8 years, the Israelites cry out to the Lord, and he raises up Othniel, Caleb's nephew, as a judge to save them. He defeats the king, they have rest for 40 years, and he dies.

## 3b. 2nd Judge: Ehud

The Israelites fall into sin again and the Lord sends Eglon (the king of Moab) to defeat them and capture Jericho, and they serve him for 18 years. They again cry out to the Lord and he sends Ehud (a left-handed man from the tribe of Benjamin which means "son of the right hand") as a judge to save them. He pretends to send a gift to the king and stabs him in the belly. Ehud escapes to Bethel (Seirah) and sounds the trumpet and calls the people to defeat the Moabites. They kill about 10,000 Moabites, and they have rest for 80 years.

## 3c. 3rd Judge: Shamgar

A non-Israelite warrior named Shamgar saves Israel from the Philistines.

## 4. 4th Judge: Deborah

After Ehud dies, the Israelites fall into sin again and the Lord sells them into slavery again to the king of Canaan (Jabin). Sisera, the commander of his army who has 900 iron chariots, oppresses them for 20 years. Deborah, a prophetess, summons Barak from Kedesh-naphtali, and has him take 10,000 men from Naphtali and Zebulun to fight Jabin's army by the river Kishon. Barak wants Deborah to go with him, and she tells him that there will be no glory for him for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. They go and defeat Jabin's army and Sisera flees to Jael's tent near Kedesh (Jael is the wife of Heber the Kenite—descendant of Jethro). He asks her for water and she gives him milk and covers him so he falls asleep. While he is sleeping, she drives a peg into his temple. She leads Barak to her tent to show him that Sisera is dead. God delivers Jabin into the hands of Israel.

## 5. The Song of Deborah and Barak

Deborah and Barak sing a victory song which praises God for his triumph over the Canaanites on Israel's behalf and reviews the events of the victory. The land has rest for 40 years.

## 6a. Midian Oppresses Israel

Israel falls into sin again and they are oppressed by Midian for seven years. They hold up in dens in the mountains, caves, and strongholds because Midian is wiping out the land and their crops. They cry out to the Lord, and he sends a prophet to remind them how he brought them out of slavery in Egypt and how they have not obeyed his voice.

## 6b. 5th Judge: Gideon

Gideon (son of Joash, Abiezrite, Manasseh West) is beating out wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites and the angel of the Lord visits him under the terebinth at Ophrah. Gideon asks God why he has forsaken the Israelites. God calls Gideon to save the Israelites, but he says his clan is the weakest in Manasseh and he is the least in his father's house. God assures Gideon he will be with him. God has him put meat and unleavened cakes with broth on a rock, and he touches them with his staff and fire springs up from the rock and consumes them. God says, "Peace be to you," and Gideon builds an altar called "The Lord is Peace". God has Gideon tear down his father's altar to Baal and his Asherah, and Gideon takes ten of his servants and does it in the middle of the night so no one sees him.

## 6c. Gideon Destroys the Altar of Baal

The men in Gideon's town find out that he destroyed the altar of Baal and they want to kill him, but his father says if Baal really is a god, let him contend against him. Gideon is called Jerubbaal (let Baal contend against him). The Midianites camp in Jazreel. Gideon sounds the trumpet to call the Abiezrites, and sends messengers to gather Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali.

## 6d. Sign of the Fleece

Gideon tests God by asking him to wet a fleece he puts on the ground with dew (showing distrust and breaking one of the Mosaic Laws not to test God). God covers the fleece with dew. He asks God the next day to wet the ground but not the fleece, and God does it.

## 7. Gideon's Three Hundred Men

Gideon and all the people camp next to the spring of Harod, just south of the Midianites near the hill of Moreh. God tells Gideon he has too many people, and they might think it was their own hand that delivered them from the Midianites. God has him send home those who are fearful, and 22,000 return home leaving 10,000. God says there are still too many, so he tells him to send home anyone who doesn't lap water like a dog, but rather kneels down (this would leave them vulnerable). This leaves 300 men. The Lord tells Gideon he has delivered the Midianites into their hand, but Gideon is afraid, so God has him go with Purah, his servant, to spy on the Midianites. They overhear a Midianite who has a dream that Gideon defeats them. Gideon and Purah go back, and Gideon divides the men into three companies and gives them trumpets and clay pots (jars) with torches in them. He tells them when they arrive to blow the trumpets, smash the jars, and shout, "For the Lord and for Gideon." The Lord turns the Midianites' swords on each other and the rest flee as far as Beth-shittah. All of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh pursue them. Gideon sends messengers throughout Ephraim and they capture the waters of Beth-barah and the Jordan. They capture and kill the princes of Midian (Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb), and they bring their heads to Gideon across the Jordan.

## 8a. Gideon Defeats Zebah and Zalmunna

Ephraim gets angry with Gideon for not calling them into war sooner, but Gideon praises them which calms them down. Gideon and the 300 men go to Succoth and ask their fellow Israelites for food, and they refuse. Gideon threatens he will return to kill them with thorns. They go to Penuel and ask their fellow Israelites for food, but they refuse. Gideon threatens he will return to tear down their tower. Gideon captures the kings of Midian (Zebah and Zalmunna) and returns to fulfill his threats to Succoth and Penuel. Things get personal between Gideon and the kings of Midian, and Gideon orders his son Jether to kill them. He is afraid to do so, so Gideon kills them himself and takes  the crescent ornaments from the necks of their camels (this shows personal vengeance and that Gideon is acting autonomously without the presence of God).

## 8b. Gideon's Ephod

The people of Israel ask Gideon to be their king since he saved them from the Midianites. He says that neither he nor his son will rule over them, but that God will rule over them. This is empty speech because he then asks them for their gold earrings, takes all the spoils, and uses them to make an Ephod which he places in Ophrah, his city (an ephod was only to be worn by the high priest). The people whore after it like a false idol, but the Israelites have rest for 40 years.

## 8c. The Death of Gideon

Gideon has 70 sons with many wives. One of his sons he names Abimelech, which means "my father is king" (shows that his desire to have the Lord rule was just lip service). Gideon dies and is buried in the tomb of Joash in Ophrah. After his death, the Israelites begin to sin again, worship other gods, and they do not show love to his family although he had saved them.

## 9. Abimelech's Conspiracy

Abimelech goes to Shechem and asks if it is better to have the 70 sons rule over them, or just one. They choose to follow Abimelech, who proceeds to hire "worthless and reckless fellows" and kill all of his brothers on one stone except for his youngest brother Jotham who hides. Then the leaders of Shechem make him king. Jotham goes on top of Mount Gerizim (the mountain of blessing) and curses his brother by telling him a fable of trees that reject kingship over the other trees and a dishonorable bramble bush that accepts. He says that if Abilemech's intentions are dishonorable, Abimelech and Shechem shall devour each other by fire. Jotham flees to Beer. God sends an evil spirit between Abimelech and Shechem. The leaders of Shechem plan to ambush Abimelech and rob all who pass by them, and Abimelech finds out. Gaal, the son of Ebed, moves into Shechem and criticizes Abimelech saying he would remove him if he had the authority. The ruler of the city, Zebul, tells this to Abimelech, and tells him to ambush him and his relatives. Gaal goes to fight Abimelech, but he is driven out of Shechem. Abimelech then proceeds to kill all the people of the city and destroy it, starting with the fields, then the Tower of Shechem (which he burns). He goes to destroy Thebez and burn down its tower, but a woman crushes his skull with a millstone. Abimelech has a man in his army kill him so he doesn't die at the hand of a woman. This fulfills the curse of Jotham, and shows how God turned their evil onto themselves.

## 10. 6th & 7th Judges: Tola and Jair

After Abimelech, God raises up two more judges, Tola (tribe of Issachar who lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim, judged 23 years, died and was buried at Shamir) and Jair (Gileadite, judged 22 years, had 30 sons who rode 30 donkeys and had 30 cities called Havvoth-jair in Gilead, died and was buried in Kamon). The Isrealites begin to sin and worship Canaanite gods again, and God delivers them into the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites who oppressed them for 18 years. They again cry out to the Lord, and he reminds them of all the times he delivered them from oppression and how they repeatedly turned away from him to serve other gods. The Israelites put away their foreign gods and serve the Lord, who becomes impatient over their misery. The Ammonites go to fight Israel in Gilead at Mizpah. The Isrealites look for a leader to fight against them.

## 11. 8th Judge: Jephthah

A mighty warrior named Jephthah, the son of a prostitute from the house of Gilead, is thrown out of his house without an inheritance. He goes and lives in Tob where a bunch of rough and rugged characters ("worthless fellows") gather around him. When the Ammonites go to fight Israel, the elders of Gilead go to meet him at Mizpah and ask him to come back and lead them in battle. He asks them why only now do they want him back. They make an agreement before the Lord that if he returns home and the Lord delivers the Ammonites into his hand, he will be their leader (note, God isn't calling Jephthah, the people are). Jephthah sends messengers to the king of the Ammonites explaining that when the Israelites attempted to pass through the land, king Sihon went to fight them and the Lord gave them into their hands and they possessed the land, therefore the land rightfully belongs to the Israelites. The Ammonites do not listen. Jephthah vows that if the Lord gives the Ammonites into their hand, he will offer whatever comes out of the doors of his house as a burnt offering (not only is this unwise, God already promised Israel victory if they keep his laws). He defeats the Ammonites from Aroer to Minnith as far as Abel-keramim (20 cities). When he returns home his daughter (his only child) comes out to greet him. He tears his clothes and cries out that he cannot take back his vow (this isn't completely true as a sin offering could be made, and human sacrifice is forbidden in the Book of the Law). His daughter goes up and down the mountains with her companions weeping for her virginity for two months and then he fulfills his vow. A custom is born where the Israelite daughters lament her for four days in the year.

## 12a. Jephthah's Conflict with Ephraim

Like with Gideon, Ephraim gets angry with Jephthah for not bringing them into battle and they threaten to burn his house down. Jephthah gathers the men of Gilead and attacks Ephraim and they attack back and call the Gileadites fugitives of Ephraim. The Gileadites capture the fords of the Jordan and they don't let the Ephraimites pass through. They test them to see if they are an Ephraimite by having them pronounce "Shibboleth", which means "a flowing stream" or "an ear of grain" and is hard for outsiders to pronounce. 42,000 Ephraimites fall. Jephthah judges Israel for 6 years, dies in Gilead, and is buried there.

## 12b. 9th, 10th, & 11th Judges: Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon

Ibzan of Bethlehem has 30 sons and 30 daughters who all marry outside the clan. He judges Israel for 7 years, and dies and is buried in Bethlehem. Elon the Zebulunites judes Israel for 10 years, and dies and is buried in Aijalon. Abdon, the son of Hillel the Pirathonite, has 40 sons and 30 grandsons. He judges Israel for 8 years, and dies and is buried at Pirathon in Ephraim.

## 13. 12th Judge: The Birth of Samson

Israel begins to sin again and the Lord gives them into the hands of the Philistines for 40 years. The wife of Manoah (tribe of Dan from Zorah) has no children. The angel of the Lord appears to her and tells her she will have a son who will be a Nazarite from birth, and she is to refrain from eating anything unclean or drinking anything strong, and she is not to cut his hair. Manoah prays to see the man, and he appears to them. The angel tells Manoah to offer a burnt offering and he does. He asks the angel his name, but he tells him that his name is too wonderful to comprehend. The angel then goes up in the flames of the altar. They call God "the one who works wonders." His wife bears a child and they name him Samson, and the Spirit of the Lord begins to "stir in him" in Mahaneh-dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

## 14. Samson's Marriage

Samson goes to Tinmah and wants to marry one of the daughters of the Philistines. His parents ask him why he won't marry an Israelite and he insists. It turns out God is seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. On his way to Tinmah, he kills a lion with his bare hands. He sees the woman and wants to marry her. He returns back and finds honey in the body of the lion and eats some and gives some to his parents, but does not tell them how he got it (contact with the dead breaks his Nazarite vow). At their wedding reception, Samson bets 30 of the Philistines 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes they can't solve his riddle. They can't solve it, so they go to his wife and threaten to burn her and her father to get the answer. Samson finds out and goes and kills 30 Philistines to get the linens and clothes. While he is away, Samson's wife is given to his best man.

## 15. Samson Defeats the Philistines

Samson returns to consummate his marriage only to find that she had been given to his best man. In a fit of rage, he releases 300 foxes with torches tied to their tails into the Philistines' grain field. In retaliation, the Philistines burn his wife and his father-in-law (the same fate she wanted to avoid by telling the answer to the riddle). Samson kills the men and flees to the rock of Etam in Judah. The Philistines go to Judah and the people of Judah find him, bind him up, and take him to the Philistines. He arrives at Lehi, the ropes melt off his hands, and he grabs a donkey's jawbone and defeats 1,000 men with it. The place is called Ramanth-lehi (hill of the jawbone). Samson is dying of thirst in Lehi and calls upon the Lord. God gives him water and the place is called En-hakkore (the spring of him who called). Samson judges Israel for 20 years.

## 16. Samson and Deliliah

Samson goes to Gaza and sleeps with a prostitute. Meanwhile, the Gazites wait outside to ambush him. Samson wakes up at midnight and pulls off the gates of the city and carries them on his shoulders to the top of the hill in front of Hebron. He goes to the Valley of Sorek where he meets and falls in love with a woman named Delilah. The Philistines bribe her with 1,100 pieces of silver to find out his weakness. He tells her three lies (bind him with 7 bowstrings, bind him with new ropes, weave seven locks of his head), but he breaks free of all of them, and each time she seduces him and tries to find his weakness. He finally tells her he has been a Nazarite since birth (here he says God and not the Lord), and that if his head is shaved, he will become weak. While he's sleeping she has a man cut seven locks off of his head. In his weakened state, the Philistines capture him, gouge out his eyes (highlighting one of his weaknesses, lust), and bring him to Gaza where he is made to grind at a mill (which was a job for women of the time, highlighting another weakness which is pride). His hair grows back, and the Philistines try to humiliate him while he is in prison, but he calls to God (here he calls him the Lord) and then he grabs two pillars and makes the house fall down on all the Philistines, killing about 3,000 men and himself. The section ends saying that Samson judged Israel for 20 years.

## Corruption of the People of Israel

* * *

## 17. Micah and the Levite

Micah, a man from Ephraim, admits he stole silver from his mother and returns it to her. She makes a carved image out of it. He puts the carved image in his house with his other gods and also makes an Ephod and "ordains" his son as a priest (clearly not following the Lord's commandments, the section says, "In those days there was no king in Israel," and "Everyone did what was right in their own eyes"). A Levite from Bethlehem (in the land of Judah) sojourns and Micah takes him in and "ordains" him and gives him a salary. Micah is very excited about having a Levite priest because he believes it will "prosper" him (implies he's using God for his selfish gain).

## 18. Danites Take the Levite and the Idol

The people of Dan send five men from Zorah to Eshtaol (towns in Judah west of Jerusalem) to spy out the land (this is because they never drove out the Canaanites). The men pass by Micah's house in Ephraim and find out that the Levite is living there, and the Levite gives them bad counsel saying, "Go in peace" (Laish wasn't allotted to them by the Lord and there are unsuspecting people there). The five men arrive at Laish (north of the Sea of Galilee) and see that the land is good. They report back and the tribe of Dan sends 600 men towards Laish. On the way, they camp at Kiriath-jearim (Mananeh-dan) in Judah and then pass by Micah's house and take his ephod, gods, and carved image, and they convince the Levite to be their priest instead (now a tribe of 600 has broken the Lord's commandments). The Danites strike down Laish and build the city Dan there. They set up the carved image and they make the Levite (who we find out is Jonathan, the grandson of Moses) and his sons their priests.

## 19. A Levite and His Concubine

A Levite from Ephraim takes a concubine from Bethlehem and she returns to her fathers house. He goes to get her, and the father-in-law invites him in and is very hospitable. The Levite stays there five days and then heads out with his concubine to return home. On the way back, they arrive near Jerusalem (Jebus) and decide to head to Gibeah (in Benjamin) to spend the night. No one takes them in, so they sit down in the middle of town and a sojourning old man finds them and takes them in. A group of wothrless fellows come to rape the Levite, but he concubine is offered instead (similar to the story of Lot in Sodom, showing the severe degradation of Israel). The men rape her and she dies at the front door of the old man's house. The Levite finds her and takes her body back home and cuts it up into twelve pieces and distributes it around Israel (a very callous and gruesome way to rally Israel against Gibeah).

## 20. Israel's War with the Tribe of Benjamin

All of Israel (the expression is *from Dan to Beersheba*) except Benjamin gathers at Mizpah (400,000 men). They hear of the abomination at Gibeah and send troops to Gibeah to execute the worthless fellows. Benjamin doesn't listen and instead prepares for battle. A civil war breaks out, and the Lord calls Judah to lead the battle against Benjamin. Benjamin kills 22,000 men, and Israel prays to see if they should continue on in battle, and the Lord says yes. Benjamin kills 18,000 more men, and Israel prays to see if they should continue on in battle, and the Lord says he will deliver Benjamim into their hands. We find out Phineas is ministering before the Ark of the Covenant in Bethel. They set men in ambush around Gibeah and draw the people of Benjamin away from the city. They kill 25,100 men of Benjamin, and the men in ambush destroy Gibeah (they destroy it like a Canaanite city which was never commanded by God). 25,000 men of Benjamin die, and 600 flee toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon.

## 21. Wives Provided for the Tribe of Benjamin

The men of Israel swore not to marry a daughter of Benjamin at Mizpah, but they realize Benjamin is still part of Israel, and that they are now very few. They build an altar at Mizpah and offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. They decide without consulting God (which is ironic because they just built an altar) to kill the men of Jabesh-gilead and give the remaining 400 women to the men of Benjamin since they had not been at the assembly at Mizpah. They make peace with the remaining people of Benjamin and give them the women as wives, but there are still men left who have no wives, so they are advised to kidnap and marry Canaanite women who are dancing at a festival in Shiloh where they are camped. The remaining people of Benjamin rebuild their cities. The book concludes by once again reminding the reader that Israel has no king and everyone was doing what was right in their own eyes.
