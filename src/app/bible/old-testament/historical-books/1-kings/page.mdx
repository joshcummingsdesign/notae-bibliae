## Synopsis

Part 1 of Kings (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="melachim" text="Melachim" />*), which is the story of the long line of kings that come after David, their failures, the dividing of the kingdom, Jerusalem's demise, and Israel's exile to Babylon.

## 1. Solomon Anointed King

David is old and ill, so a young woman named Abishag the Shunammite is sent in to be "of service to the king", but he knows her not. This prompts Adonijah, his son, to "exalt himself" as king, and gather chariots, horsemen, and 50 men to run before him (riding through town as if to declare himself as king). David does not rebuke him. Joab and Abiathar (the priest) support him, but Zadok, Benaiah (son of Jehoiada), Nathan (the prophet), Shimei (house of Saul), Rei, and David's mighty men do not. Adonijah sacrifices sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Serpent's Stone near En-rogel (south of Jerusalem) and invites his brothers and all the royal officials of Judah, but he does not invite Nathan, Benaiah, the mighty men of David, or his brother Solomon. Nathan goes to Bathsheba and explains the situation, and asks her to confront David. She confronts him and Nathan goes in after her. David tells Bathsheba that their son Solomon is to be king, and tells Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah to have Solomon ride his mule (signifies he is the favored son) to Gihon (south of Jerusalem, near En-rogel) and anoint him, blow the trumpet, and say, "Long live King Solomon!" Benaiah says, "Make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David." They go along with the Cherethites and Pelethites (David's Canaanite servants), anoint him, and rejoice with great joy. Adonijah and his guests hear the rejoicing, and Jonathan (son of Abiathar) tells him Solomon is king. Adonijah fears Solomon and puts his hands on the horns of the altar in hopes he will be protected from Solomon's vengeance. Solomon says if he is a worthy man he shall live, but if he is wicked, he shall die. All the men return home.

## 2. David's Death / Solomon's Reign Established

As David is dying, he tells Solomon, "Be strong, and show yourself a man, and keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in His ways and keeping His statues, His rules, and His testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses." He makes it clear that this is the LORD's covenant to establish David's throne forever. He then tells Solomon to put Joab to death for killing Abner and Amasa (perhaps David is concerned he will be an issue for Solomon), to protect Barzillai and let him eat at the king's table for his loyalty when he fled from Absalom, and to put Shimei to death for cursing him when he went to Mahanaim (perhaps David is worried for Solomon and Israel because Shimei is from the house of Saul). David passes away (he ruled 40 years, 7 years in Hebron, and 33 years in Jerusalem), and is buried in the city of David. Solomon's throne is established. Adonijah goes to Bathsheba and asks her to tell Solomon he would like Abishag the Shunammite as his wife. Since she is associated with King David, Solomon takes this as a power move and has him executed. He then has Abiathar expelled from priesthood for his association with Adonijah, thus fulfilling the prophecy regarding the house of Eli in Shiloh (1 Samuel 2). Solomon then has Joab executed. Solomon then makes Benaiah his commander and makes Zadok priest. Solomon tells Shimei to build himself a house in Jerusalem and to stay there lest he be put to death. Shimei agrees and does so, but three years later, his servants run away and he goes after them. Solomon finds out and has him executed for disobeying his command. The section ends saying, "So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."

## 3. Solomon's Prayer for Wisdom

Solomon marries the Egyptian Pharaoh's daughter (a political move which breaks the law against intermarriage and displays a lack of trust in God since it favors politics over God's protective care). Solomon and the people of Israel begin worshiping at "high places" (not what the law called for) because the temple is not yet built. Solomon makes offerings and sacrifices (a thousand of them) at Gibeon. There, the LORD appears to him in a dream and asks Solomon what he wants, and Solomon asks for wisdom in leading the people of Israel. Because he did not pray for riches, the life of his enemies, or a long life, God grants his prayer for wisdom, and gives him wealth, honor, wisdom, and promises a long life if he keeps the LORD's commands. Solomon's wisdom is demonstrated when two prostitutes come to him saying that they both had children, one died, and one woman switched the children in the middle of the night. Solomon politely offers to "divide the living child in two" with a sword to settle the dispute. This makes the point clear to the women, and Solomon has the woman return the child. Israel begins to see that the wisdom of God is in Solomon to do justice.

## 4. Solomon's Wealth and Wisdom

This section lists Solomon's officials. Azariah (son of Zadok) is now the high priest, and Zadok takes a lower position as priest along with Abiathar who is evidently reinstated. Elihoreph and Ahijah are secretaries. Jehoshaphat is recorder. Benaiah (son of Jehoiada) is commander of the army. Zabud is the king's friend. Ahishar is in charge of the palace. Adoniram is in charge of forced labor. Solomon has 12 officers over Israel who provide food for the king and his household. This, however, is not a tribal system, but a system with one governor (Azariah, son of Nathan) and 12 districts. The officer from each district has to make provisions (perhaps also collect taxes) for 1 month in the year. Solomon's system, which is based in his God-given wisdom, gives Israel peace and abundance without oppression. His influence also reaches to all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. Solomon does, however, acquire many horses for himself (breaking the laws of Deuteronomy). God gives Solomon "wisdom and understanding beyond measure." This, along with his knowledge of the natural world, makes him the wisest of all Israel's kings. People of all nations, including their kings, come to hear his wisdom.

## 5. Preparations for Building the Temple

Israel has peace and rest from their enemies, and Solomon asks Hiram, the king of Tyre who was on good terms with David, for cedar from Lebanon to help build the temple. The Isralites do not know how to cut down the mighty cedar trees like they do. Hiram agrees, but wants to have the cedar brought from Lebanon to the sea in exchange for food for his men (likely to not reveal trade secrets). They agree and Solomon gives him wheat and oil in exchange for cedar and cypress. The two make a treaty, and Solomon begins sending men to Lebanon. Solomon drafts 30,000 men, led by Adoniram, to work in groups of 10,000 a month in shifts (one month in Lebanon, two months at home). Solmon has 70,000 burden-bearers, 80,000 stonecutters, and 3,300 chief officers to oversee the work. They quarry out precious stones, and prepare all the timber and stones to build the temple.

## 6. Solomon Builds the Temple

In the second month (Ziv, spring) of the 4th year of Solomon's reign (408 years after the exodus) the temple construction begins. The temple is 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet tall. The work is carried out with reverence, avoiding the use of iron tools at the temple site (following the law). The temple has a large nave with clerestory windows with recessed frames, an inner sanctuary (Most Holy Place) where the ark was kept and guarded by two 15-foot cherubim made of olivewood and separated by ornate wooden doors overlaid with gold, a vestibule which was separated from the nave by ornate wooden doors overlaid with gold, and a three-story structure built around the walls of the temple. There are many nods to the Garden of Eden, such as the east-facing entrance and the intricate carvings of cherubim, open flowers, and palm trees, all overlaid with gold. The Word of the LORD comes to Solomon and tells him that if he obeys His commandments, He will establish the covenant made with David through Solomon, dwell among the people of Israel, and not forsake them. The temple is finished seven years later in the eighth month (Bul, fall).

## 7. Solomon's Palace / Temple Furnishings

Solomon spends 13 years building his palace which includes the House of the Forest of Lebanon (a large section of the palace that had so much cedar it earned its name), the Hall of Pillars (a section almost as large as the temple), the Hall of the Throne / the Hall of Judgment (where he was to pronounce judgment), his own house, a court, and a house for his wife (Pharaoh's daughter). All of these were made of cedar and costly stones. Solomon commissions Hiram from Tyre (whose father was from Tyre and whose mother was a widow from Naphtali, unrelated to the aforementioned king) to build the temple furnishings. Hiram is full of wisdom and understanding and skill. Hiram builds two bronze pillars. The one on the south is named Jachin (*he establishes*) and the one on the north is named Boaz (*in him is strength*). He builds the sea, which is a large metal basin containing 12–18k gallons of water (representing the chaos subdued by the LORD) supported by twelve metal oxen. He builds ten bronze stands on wheels which are designed to hold basins containing water and are decorated with lions, oxen, and cherubim. Five basins are placed on the north side, five are placed on the south side, and the sea is placed in the southwest corner. He also makes pots and shovels of bronze. Solomon does the gold work and makes the altar, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstands (inner sanctuary, 5 on the north, 5 on the south), the utensils, and the doors. The temple is finished, and Solomon brings in the things that David dedicated to the LORD and stores them in the treasuries.

## 8. The Temple Dedication

In the seventh month, seven years after the beginning of the temple construction, during the Feast of Booths (Ethanim / Tishri, September / October, fall), the priests take the tabernacle and the ark from the city of David to the temple (north of the city of David). Solomon and the congregation offer sacrifices before the ark before it is brought into the temple. The priests bring the ark into the Most Holy Place in the temple under the wings of the cherubim. At this time, the ark only contains the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb (the jar of manna and Aaron's rod are apparently no longer there). The glory of the LORD appears in a cloud and fills the house of God, and it is so powerful the priests cannot stand to minister. Solomon blesses the LORD before the assembly for fulfilling His promise to David that Solomon would take the throne and build a house for the name of the LORD (His presence cannot be contained, He is transcendent, but the house will be the place of worship for Israel where He will bless and watch over His people and accept their right sacrifices). Solomon stands before the altar raising his hands towards heaven and prays a prayer of dedication before the assembly saying, "Listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen in heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive." His prayer has seven pleas. The first plea is that when a man sins against his neighbor, God will condemn the guilty and vindicate the righteous. The second plea is that when Israel is defeated by an enemy due to sin, that God will forgive their sin when they repent. The third plea is that when there is drought due to sin, God will forgive their sin when they repent. The fourth plea is that when there is famine or plague due to sin, God will forgive their sin when they repent. The fifth plea is that when a Gentile comes to the house of the LORD for His name's sake, he will be accepted so all the peoples of the earth may know His name. The sixth plea is that when the LORD sends His people into battle, that He will hear their prayers and maintain their cause. The seventh plea is that when the people are exiled due to sin (for there is no one who does not sin), that God will forgive their sin when they repent, remember His chosen people, and deliver them like He did from Egypt. Solomon turns to the people and prays that God will be with them, that they walk in all His ways and keep His commandments, and that God remember the words he has spoken before the assembly. Solomon and the priests offer sacrifices and dedicate the house of the LORD. Solomon holds the Feast of Booths and sends the people home on the eighth day. They return home full of joy and hope.

## 9a. The LORD Appears to Solomon

As soon as Solomon finishes building the temple and his house, the LORD appears to him and says, "I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house that you have built, by putting my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time." God says that if Solomon walks before him as his father did, then He will fulfill the Davidic covenant, but if he or his children turn aside and worship other gods, He will cut of Israel from the land, bring the temple to ruins, and they will serve as an example of a people who turned away from the LORD.

## 9b. Solomon's Other Acts

This section recounts the events that occur within the first twenty years of Solomon's reign. Solomon gives Hiram twenty cities in Galilee, which do not please Hiram, so they are called the land of Cabul (*translation fetters*). Hiram still continues to give Solomon gold. Solomon drafts the descendants of the Canaanites who were not destroyed to forced labor and has them build the temple, his house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer (given to Solomon's wife as a dowry from the Pharoah who captured it), Lower Beth-horon (northwest of Jerusalem), Baalath (in Dan), Tamar (in Edom, south of the Dead Sea), all his store cities, cities for his chariots and horsemen, and all that Solomon desires to build in the land and in Lebanon. The Israelites are made officials, commanders, captains, and horsemen. He has 550 chief officers. Solomon's wife moves from the city of David to the house that Solomon built for her. Three times a year, Solomon offers burnt offerings and peace offerings at the temple (Passover, Feast of Weeks, Feast of Booths). He also builds a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber (shore of the Red Sea), and Hiram sends him skilled sailors to join his men. They go to Ophir (in Arabia) and bring back gold for Solomon.

## 10. The Queen of Sheba

The queen of Sheba (modern Yemen) hears of Solomon's wisdom and comes to see him in Jerusalem. She is left breathless by his wealth and wisdom. She says, "Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel!" She then gives him gold, spices, and precious stones in great quantities. Solomon gives her all that she desires. Solomon's fleet of ships brings almug wood and precious stones from Ophir. Solomon accumulates so much gold that he makes 900 gold shields and puts them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon, and makes an ivory throne with six steps and twelve lions. He makes silver as common as stone and cedar as plentiful as Sycamore (acquiring excessive silver and gold breaks the laws regarding kings in Deuteronomy). He adds to his ships the fleet of Tarshish (Mediterranean Sea). His fame is so great that people come from all over bringing gifts to hear his wisdom. It says, "The whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind." He acquires more horses, and even horses from Egypt (breaks the laws regarding kings in Deuteronomy), and begins importing horses and chariots from Kue (north of Mediterranean Sea) and Egypt and exporting them to the Hittities and Syria.

## 11. Solomon Turns from the LORD

Solomon takes 700 wives and 300 concubines from the Egyptians, Sidonians, and Canaanites (breaking the laws regarding both marriage and kings in Deuteronomy), and he builds places of worship for their gods (Ashtoreth, Milcom \[god of the underworld], Chemosh, Molech). The LORD becomes angry with Solomon because his heart turned away from the LORD, and He tells Solomon that He will tear the kingdom from the hand of his son, leaving him only one tribe for the sake of David. The LORD raises up two enemies against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite and Rezon king of Damascus. The prophet Ahijah goes to Jeroboam the Ephraimite, who Solomon appointed over forced labor of the house of Joseph, tears his garment into 12 pieces and gives him ten, and tells him God will tear the kingdom from the hands of Solomon's son and give Jeroboam ten tribes, leaving only one to Solomon's son (one tribe is apparently left out of the picture). Solomon finds out and looks to kill Jeroboam, so Jeroboam flees to Egypt. Solomon's story is written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon, and he reigns 40 years. Solomon dies and is buried in the city of David. Solomon's son Rehoboam takes the throne.

## 12. Rehoboam's Folly

All Israel goes to Shechem to make Rehoboam king. Jeroboam leaves Egypt and returns with the assembly before Rehoboam. They ask Rehoboam to lighten the hard service and heavy yoke on them (Solomon had put them to forced labor like the days in Egypt). Rehoboam sends the people away for three days so he can meet with his advisers. The elders tell him to lighten the load, but his friends tell him to make the load heavier. He listens to his friends and when Israel returns, he tells them, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions." The LORD hardened Rehoboam's heart to fulfill his plans (much like he did to Pharaoh in Egypt). Rehoboam sends Adoram, head of forced labor, but Israel stones him to death. Rehoboam flees to Jerusaelm. Israel then splits into two factions, Israel in the north led by Jeroboam, and Judah in the south led by Rehoboam. Benjamin gets absorbed into Judah. The two factions prepare for a civil war, but Shemaiah, a man of God, says the LORD says they shall not fight, but shall return home, and so they do. Jeroboam builds Shechem and lives there, and builds Penuel. He fears the kingdom will return to the rule of Rehoboam if they worship in the temple, so he builds two golden calves (one in Bethel, and one in Dan), two altars, makes temples in high places, and appoints non-Levites as priests. He even declares his own unsanctioned feast on the 15th day of the 8th month.

## 13. A Man of God Confronts Jeroboam

The LORD commands a man of God from Judah to go straight to Bethel, not stopping to eat bread or drink water, to warn Jeroboam that a son shall be born to the house of David named Josiah who will sacrifice the priests. Jeroboam calls out to have him seized, but as a sign from the LORD, his hand dries up and the altar is torn down and ashes pour out from it. Jeroboam calls the man to intercede, and when he does, Jeroboam's hand returns as normal. Jeroboam invites him back to refresh himself, but he declines as commanded by the LORD. A prophet from Bethel gets word of the story of the man, and finds him under an oak tree. The prophet lies telling him the LORD wants him to come back and eat bread and drink water with him. The man listens and goes back to eat bread and drink water. As the man is returning home on his donkey, he is killed by a lion who then stands beside his body and the donkey (uncharacteristic of a lion, meaning the LORD had given him over to the lion, and implying that not even prophets are above God's commands). The prophet brings the man's body back to Bethel and buries him and mourns for him. He tells his sons that he is to be buried with the man when he dies. Jeroboam does not turn from his ways, and the destruction of his house is prophesied.

## 14a. Prophecy Against Jeroboam

Jeroboam, who moved his royal court to Tirzah northeast of Shechem, has a son named Abijah who becomes very sick, so he tells his wife to disguise herself and go to Ahijah the prophet. Although his sight is dim because of his age, the LORD tells Ahijah that she is on her way. As soon as he hears the sound of her feet, he calls her out and tells her that because of Jeroboam's grave sin, the LORD will cut off every male from his house. He says those who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the country shall be eaten by birds. He says that as soon as her feet enter the city, Abijah will die and Israel shall mourn for him and bury him because in him there is found something pleasing to the LORD. He says God will raise up a king who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam, and Israel will be exiled from the land because they have provoked the LORD to anger with their apostasy and idolatry. Jeroboam's wife returns to Tirzah, and as soon as she comes to the threshold of her house, Abijah dies. Israel buries him and mourns just as the LORD had said.

## 14b. The Death of Jeroboam and Rehoboam

Jeroboam reigns for 22 years over Israel and dies. His story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. His son Nadab reigns in his place. Rehoboam reigns for 17 years over Judah in Jerusalem. Like Israel, Judah turns away from the LORD to worship other gods, and do worse abominations than their fathrs such as having Asherim, high places for worshipping other gods, and male cult prostitutes (all Israel is starting to look more like Canaan). In his 5th year, Shishak, king of Egypt, comes up against them and takes away all the treasures of the house of the LORD, including the shields of gold. Rehoboam makes bronze shields in their place for his officers to use. Rehoboam's story is recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. There is war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. Rehoboam dies and is buried in the city of David. His son Abijam reigns in his place.

## 15a. Abijam Reigns in Judah

In the 18th year of Jeroboam's reign, Rehoboam's son Abijam begins to reign over Judah. He reigns for three years, and walks in the sins of his father. For David's sake, however, the LORD promises his son will rule in Jerusalem. There is continued war between Judah and Israel. Abijam's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. He dies and is buried in the city of David. His son Asa reigns in his place.

## 15b. Asa Reigns in Judah

In the 20th year of Jeroboam's reign, Abijam's son Asa begins to reign over Judah. He does what is right in the eyes of the LORD, and reigns for 41 years. He puts the cult prostitutes out of the land, removes all the idols his fathers had made, removes his mother Maacah as queen mother and burns her image for Asherah at the brook Kidron. The high places, however, are not removed, but he does bring sacred gifts into the house of the LORD. War continues between Judah and Israel. Baasha, king of Israel, pushes into Benjamin and fortifies the city of Ramah (north of Jerusalem). Asa takes all of the silver and gold from the house of the LORD and gives it to Ben-hedad, the king of Syria who lived in Damasus, to make a covenant. Ben-hedad goes up against Israel, and Baashah stops building Ramah and goes to live in Tirzah. Asa commands all Judah to take the stones and timber from Ramah and use it to build Geba and Mizpah. Asa's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. He gets a disease in his feet, dies, and is buried in the city of David. His son Jehoshaphat reigns in his place.

## 15c. Nadab Reigns in Israel

In the 2nd year of Asa's reign, Jeroboam's son Nadab begins to reign over Israel. He reigns for two years, and does what is evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of his father. In the 3rd year of Asa's reign, Baasha, son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar, conspires against Nadab and strikes him down at Gibbethon where Israel was fighting the Philistines. Baasha begins to reign of Israel, and kills all the house of Jeroboam, fulfilling the prophecy of the LORD. Nadab's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. There is continual war between Asa and Baasha.

## 15d–16a. Baasha Reigns in Israel

In the 3rd year of Asa's reign, Ahijah of Issachar's son Baasha begins to reign over Israel at Tirzah. He reigns for 24 years. He does what is evil in the eyes of the LORD, and walks in the way of Jeroboam. The Word of the LORD comes to Jehu, the son of Hanani, and he tells Baasha because he has provoked the LORD to anger, his house will be destroyed like the house of Jeroboam. Baasha's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. He dies and is buried at Tirzah. Elah, his son, reigns in his place.

## 16b. Elah Reigns in Israel

In the 26th year of Asa's reign, Elah begins to reign. He reigns for two years in Tirzah. Elah walks in the sins of his father. In the 27th year of Asa's reign, Elah's servant Zimri conspires against him and kills him while he is drunk at the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah. Zimri reigns in his place, and strikes down all the house of Baasha, as prophesied by the LORD through the prophet Jehu. Elah's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

## 16c. Zimri Reigns in Israel

Zimri reigns for 7 days in Israel. Zimri walks in the sins of Jeroboam. The troops are encamped at Gibbethon when they find out he conspired against Elah. There, they decide to make Omri, the commander of the army, king instead. Omri and the army go to Tirzah and besiege it. When Zimri sees the city is taken, he goes into the citadel of the king's house, burns it, and dies in the fire. Zimri's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

## 16d. Omri Reigns in Israel

Israel divides into two parts, one following Tibni, son of Ginath, and the other following Omri. The followers of Omri overcome the followers of Tibni, and Tibni dies. In the 31st year of Asa's reign, Omri becomes king of Israel. He reigns for 12 years. He spends 6 years in Tirzah, and then buys the hill of Samaria from Shemer, and fortifies it. Omri does more evil in the sight of the LORD than all the kings before him. His story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. He dies and is buried in Samaria. His son Ahab reigns in his place.

## 16e. Ahab Reigns in Israel

In the 38th year of Asa's reign, Ahab reigns over Israel in Samaria. He reigns there for 22 years, and does more evil in the sight of the LORD than any king before him. He makes Jeroboam's acts look like nothing. He takes as a wife Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, and goes to serve Baal and worship him. He builds an altar for Baal and an Asherah in Samaria. A man named Hiel from Bethel rebuilds Jericho, invoking the curse spoken by Joshua according to the Word of the LORD. This costs Hiel the life of his sons Abiram and Segub.

## 17a. Elijah, The Drought, & The Widow

The Word of the LORD comes to Elijah of Tishbe (in Gilead) and he tells Ahab that the LORD, before whom he stands, has said there will be a drought, and rain or dew will only come by His Word (Baal was thought to control the rain and fertility). God tells Elijah to go to the brook of Cherith (east of the Jordan) and drink from the brook, and that ravens will bring him food. He does so, and the ravens bring him bread and meat in the morning and in the evening (twice a day is more than the bread from heaven in the wilderness during the exodus), and he drinks from the brook until it dries up. The LORD then tells him to go to Zarephath (in Sidon, heartland of Baal worship), and that He has commanded a widow there to feed him. He arrives and sees a widow gathering sticks, and asks her for water. She brings him water, then he asks her for food. She says she only has a handful of flour in a jar, and a little oil in a jug. She says she's gathering the sticks to go prepare it for her son as a last meal for them. Elijah tells her not to fear, and to prepare him a little food first because God will not let her jar nor her jug go empty. In an act of faith in the face of possible starvation for her and her son, she does as Elijah says, and her jar and jug don't go empty.

## 17b. Elijah Raises the Widow's Son

The widow's son becomes ill and dies. The widow cries, "What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son!" Elijah brings the boy upstairs, lays him on the bed, and cires to the LORD and stretches himself out on the child three times, and the LORD listens to Elijah and resurrects the boy. Elijah brings the boy back to the widow and she says, "Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the Word of the LORD in your mouth is truth."

## 18a. Elijah Confronts Ahab

Three years later, the LORD tells Elijah that He will send rain upon the earth, but Elijah is to first confront Ahab. There is a famine in Samaria, and Jezebel kills the prophets of the LORD, but Ahab's servant Obadiah, who greatly fears the LORD, hides one hundred of them in a cave with bread and water to keep them safe. Ahab tells Obadiah to go with him to look for grass for the horses and mules. They split up, and Obadiah runs into Elijah. Elijah tells him to get Ahab, but Obadiah fears that Elijah has come because of Obadiah's sin, and worries that after telling Ahab, Elijah will flee and Obadiah will be killed. Elijah promises that he won't flee, so Obadiah gets Ahab. Ahab calls Elijah a "troubler of Israel," but Elijah says, "I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father's house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals." He tells Ahab to gather the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah and meet him at Mount Carmel (the northwestern end of a mountain range near the coast, west of the Jezreel Valley).

## 18b. The Prophets of Baal Defeated

Ahab gathers the people and the 850 pagan prophets together at Mount Carmel, and Elijah asks them how long they will go on "limping" between two different opinions (limping was a ritual dance performed by the prophets of Baal, and the two different opinions refer to the ways of the LORD and the ways of Baal). Elijah challenges the 450 prophets of Baal to give an offering to their god, and that he alone will call upon the name of the LORD, and whoever answers by fire will be the true God. The pagan prophets call to Baal from morning until noon, limping and cutting themselves, but there is no answer. Elijah mocks them saying, "perhaps he is asleep." Elijah rebuilds a torn-down altar of the LORD with twelve stones, digs a trench around it, puts the wood and the bull on the altar, and pours twelve jars of water over everything until the trench is full (water is a vital resource in a drought, and would prevent any natural fire). He says, "Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that You, O LORD, are God, and that You have turned their hearts back." The fire of the LORD consumes the offering, wood, stones, dust, and water. The people fall to their faces and say, "The LORD, He is God." (this is in fact what the name Elijah means). Elijah orders the people to seize the prophets of Baal, and they are brought to the brook Kishon where they are killed.

## 18c. The LORD Sends Rain

Elijah tells Ahab to go up and eat and drink because there will be rain. Elijah goes to the top of Mount Carmel and bows himself down on the earth and puts his face between his knees. He tells his servant to go look toward the sea seven times, and on the seventh time, the servant tells him there is a cloud like a man's hand rising from the sea. Elijah tells his servant to tell Ahab to prepare his chariot lest the rain stop him. The clouds and wind quickly move in, and a great rain pours down. Ahab goes to Jezreel. The hand of the LORD is with Elijah (Baal was thought to control fire and lightning, neither of which proved to be true, there was no fire to consume the offering, and there was no rain to end the famine until the LORD brought rain), and he runs before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

## 19a. Elijah Flees Jezebel

At Jezreel, Ahab tells Jezebel about the killing of the pagan prophets, and she looks to kill Elijah. Elijah fears for his life and flees to Beersheba (120 miles south, as far as you can get from Jezreel) and leaves his servant there. He then goes off into the wilderness and sits under a broom tree where he is so distraught he calls to the LORD to take his life. He lies down to sleep, and an angel of the LORD comes to him twice and touches him and gives him food and water. The food gives him the strength to journey forty days and forty nights to Mount Sinai.

## 19b. The LORD Speaks to Elijah

Elijah arrives at Mount Sinai and goes into a cave. The LORD asks him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" He responds, "I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, thrown down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away." (his fear and despair seemingly make him forget about the miraculous provision, the raising of the dead child, and the mighty acts of God on the mountaintops, and make him feel like he is the only one left—in his mind, the resistance of one person turns an overwhelming victory into a massive defeat). God commands, "Go out and stand on the mount before the LORD." A strong wind tears the mountains, there is an earthquake, and then there is fire, and in each of these, the LORD is not found. Elijah gives into fear and stays in the cave (he has always claimed to stand before God, and here he fails to do so). Finally, the LORD speaks to Elijah with a low whisper (God doesn't always show up in spectacular demonstrations of divine power, but sometimes in stillness and quiet). Elijah wraps his face in his cloak (making it difficult for the seer to see, but also perhaps he is so close to God that he doesn't want to see His face, as man shall not see God's face and live) and goes to the entrance of the cave. God asks him again, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" It's almost as if God expects a different response, but Elijah responds the same way he did the first time. God commands him to go to Demascus to anoint Hazael to be king over Syria, then to anoint Jehu (son of Nimshi) to be king over Israel, and then to have Elisha, son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah (west of the Jordan), take his place as prophet. God says, "The one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death. Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him." Victory over idolatry in Israel will come in the form of a whisper (a political process), and not in a spectacular demonstration of divine power, and it will arrive not as a result of Elijah's efforts, but as a result of God's plan to have Elijah pave the way for faithful few who haven't bowed to Baal or kissed him.

## 19c. The Call of Elisha

Surprisingly, Elijah doesn't go to anoint Hazael or Jehu. He does, however, go to find Elisha (whose name means "God saves", which is fitting as he is to usher in a new era of salvation). As Elisha is plowing with his 12 oxen, Elijah throws his cloak around him, and walks away. Elisha is prepared to give up his life for the service of God, so he kisses his mother and father goodbye, sacrifices his 12 oxen, feeds the people of his town with them, and then goes to follow Elijah.

## 20. Ahab Wars with Syria

Ben-hadad, king of Syria, gathers his army and 32 kings, and goes to fight against Samaria. He sends messengers to Ahab saying that he will take his silver, gold, wives, and children. Aham complies. Ben-hadad sends again and says he will send his servants to pillage his house and the houses of Ahab's servants. The elders advise Ahab not to comply. Ben-hadad threatens him, and he says, "Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off." Ben-hedad is drinking with the kings in the tents, and they get Ahab's message. They prepare for battle. A prophet tells Ahab that the LORD will give the Syrian army into their hand, and that he is to begin the battle which will be led by the servants of the governors of the districts (young men, who like David are untrained in military matters). Ahab gathers the 232 servants and 7,000 people of Israel and attack and strike down the Syrians while the kings are drunk. They strike down 100,000 foot soldiers in one day, and the other 27,000 flee to Aphek (way up north in what was Asher) where the wall of the city collapses on them. The prophets tell Ahab they will return in the spring. The Sryians believe that the LORD is only a "god of the hills", and so they plan to return to attack them in the plain. The large Syrian army comes up against the small camp of Israel in the spring. The LORD says He will deliver the army into their hand so they know He is the LORD. On the seventh day, Israel strikes down the Syrian army. Ben-hadad flees, and his servants put on sackcloth and put ropes on their heads (showing submission) to try and take advantage of Israel's mercy. Ahab spares Ben-hadad, and Ben-hadad restores cities that his father took from Israel. By the command of the LORD, a man of the sons of the prophets asks another man to strike him, but he refuses, so a lion strikes the other man down. He asks another man, and he does so and wounds him. The prophet goes to Ahab with a bandage over his eyes and tells him a story in hopes to get his attention. He says that he was to watch over a prisoner of war, and that if the prisoner went missing, he was to give a talent of silver (an impossible amount for a common person to have) or his life. He tells Ahab that he let the prisoner go missing. Ahab is prepared to kill him for doing so when he removes the bandage and recognizes the prophet. The prophet tells him that *he* is the one who let Ben-hadad go, whom the LORD devoted to destruction. Ahab returns to Samaria angered and distraught.

## 21. Naboth's Vineyard

A Jezreelite named Naboth has a vineyard next to the palace of Ahab, and Ahab wants it so he can plant food. Naboth refuses to give it to him because it is his family's land inheritance from the LORD. This angers Ahab, so Jezebel writes a letter in Ahab's name to the elders of the city planning a conspiracy against Naboth in which a fast is proclaimed, and two men would bear false witness against him saying he cursed God and the king, causing him to be stoned to death (two witnesses were required by law). The elders comply and Naboth is stoned to death. Ahab then goes and takes his vineyard. The Word of the LORD comes to Elijah, and the LORD says He will make Ahab's house like the house of Jeroboam and Baasha, and cut off every male from his house, and that Jezebel will die in Jezreel (the dogs shall eat her). The LORD says any who die in the city, the dogs shall eat, and any who die in the country, the birds shall eat. It is made clear that no one sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD like Ahab. Ahab then puts on sackclock, fasts, and repents. The LORD spares Ahab for humbling himself, but says He will bring disaster upon his house in the days of his son.

## 22a. Ahab and the False Prophets

Israel and Syria have peace for three years. Then, Ahab asks Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, to go and capture Ramoth-gilead from Syria (Syria had captured the important trade route from the Red Sea to Damascus). Jehoshaphat agrees, but first wants to inquire for the Word of the LORD. Ahab gathers together the 400 "prophets", who tell him what he wants to hear, that he will be successful in battle. Jehoshaphat knows something is up, and asks if there is anyone else of whom they may inquire. Ahab says there is the prophet Micaiah, but that he hates him because his prophesies are never good concerning him (or perhaps they are too truthful). Jehoshaphat insists, and Micaiah is summoned. The "prophet" Zedekiah makes iron horns (symbolizing the calf and shows that idolatry was still continuing) to enact Israel winning in battle, and the "prophets" continue to tell Ahab what he wants to hear.

## 22b. Micaiah Prophesies Against Ahab

Micaiah is summoned, and is told to speak favorably to Ahab, and he does, but Ahab tells him to speak the truth. Micaiah tells Ahab that Israel will be like sheep scattered on the mountains with no shepherd, and the LORD will tell them they have no master and to return home. He says that the LORD sent a spirit to put lying words in the mouths of the "prophets" to draw Ahab out to battle where he would be killed. Zedekiah slaps him and accuses him of lying based on the fact that the LORD couldn't possibly be speaking to them both. Micaiah prophesies that Zedekiah will be forced to hide away in the inner chamber of someone's home. Ahab has his men seize Micaiah, and take him to Amon (governor of Samaria) and Joash (the king's son, responsible for the confinement of prisoners) where he is put in prison with meager rations of bread and water.

## 22c. Ahab Killed in Battle

Ahab disguises himself and tells Jehoshaphat to wear his robes, and Israel and Judah go to capture Ramoth-gilead. The king of Syria commands his captains to pursue Ahab. They find Jehoshaphat, but he cries out and they realize it's not Ahab and turn back from him. A soldier shoots an arrow at random, and it hits Ahab in the one place his armor doesn't cover (between the scale armor and the breastplate). He is propped up in his chariot for the rest of the battle, and dies in the evening. The battle ceases, and he is brought to Samaria where he is buried. The dogs lick up his blood and the male cult prostitutes wash themselves in it, thus fulfilling the prophesy of the LORD. Ahab's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, and his son Ahaziah reigns in his place.

## 22d. Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah

In the fourth year of Ahab's reign over Israel, Asa's son Jehoshaphat begins to rule in Judah. He reigns for 25 years in Jerusalem. He walks in the way of his father, not turning from the LORD. The high places, however, are not taken away. Jehoshaphat makes peace with the kings of Israel. His story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. He gets rid of all of the male cult prostitutes. Judah controls Edom. Judah's ships are wrecked at Ezion-geber. Ahaziah wants to send his men on his ships, but Jehoshaphat declines (showing there is still some hostility). Jehoshaphat dies and is buried in the city of David. His son Joram reigns in his place.

## 22e. Ahaziah Reigns in Israel

In the 17th year of Jehoshaphat's reign over Judah, Ahaziah begins to reign in Israel. He reigns for two years, and does what is evil in the sight of the LORD like his father and mother. He serves and worships Baal, and provokes the LORD to anger in every way his father did.
