## Joshua Leads Israel

* * *

## 1. God Commissions Joshua

After Moses dies, God calls Joshua to lead the people of Israel into the promised land. God reassures Joshua that he will be with Israel on their journey, and tells him to be strong, not to be frightened, and to meditate on the Book of the Law (the Torah) so that he is careful to do all that is written in it. Joshua commands the officers to prepare the people to cross over the Jordan in three days. The officers do all that Joshua commands, just as they had done for Moses.

## 2. Rahab Hides the Spies

Joshua sends two spies from Shittim (east of the Jordan) into Jericho (west of the Jordan). They arrive the city wall where a prostitute named Rahab lives, and she gives them lodging for the night. The king gets word of this and sends men out to find them, but Rahab hides them on the roof with stalks of flax and lies to protect them and tells them they went out of the gates of the city. The men go out to look for the spies and the gates of the city shut. Rahab tells the spies that she and the people of Jericho have heard of the Israelites and their story and that their "hearts melted" (showing an awareness of and openness to the Lord). Before she sneaks them out of the house, she has the spies promise that Israel will protect her and her family as she has dealt kindly with them. They tell her to hang a scarlet cord out of her window when they come into the land, and they will be protected. The spies flee to the hills, hide, and return to Shittim three days later. The spies tell Joshua all that happened, and tell him that the Lord has given all the land into their hands.

## 3. Israel Crosses the Jordan

The next morning, Joshua leads the people from Shittim to the Jordan, and they camp near the Jordan. He tells the people when they see the Ark of the Covenant, they shall follow it, but to keep a 2,000 cubit distance (about a half mile) from it so they can see it and follow its path. He tells the people to consecrate themselves because the Lord will do wonders among them. God tells Joshua he will exalt him in the eyes of Israel. Joshua tells the people to take 12 men (one from each tribe) and when the priests' feet touch the waters of the Jordan, it will part like the Red Sea. They arrive at the Jordan and it is overflowing because of the spring rains. When the priests' feet touch the water, it parts from Adam (a city up north) to the Salt Sea (Dead Sea, Sea of Arabah). The priests hold their ground carrying the ark while all the people of Israel cross over the Jordan. Here they are called a nation for the first time, fulfilling God's promise to make them a great nation.

## 4. Twelve Memorial Stones from the Jordan

God commands Joshua to have each one of the 12 men pass by the ark and collect a stone to be used for a memorial and bring it to the camp across the Jordan. Joshua sets up 12 stones in the Jordan where the priests stood. The sons of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe Manasseh pass over armed before the people (about 40,000 warriors). Like Moses, Joshua is exalted in the sight of all Israel. After Israel crosses the Jordan, the priests cross with the ark, and the waters flow back in behind them. On the tenth day of the first month, the people arrive at Gilgal (on the east border of Jericho), and Joshua sets up the 12 stones as a memorial to the wonder that God did among them, and to show future generations that the hand of the Lord is mighty.

## 5a. The New Generation Circumcised

The Canaanites get word of the parting of the Jordan and begin to fear the Israelites. Joshua circumcises the new generation of Israel at Gibeth-haaraloth (translation: hill of the foreskins). The men remain in the camp until they are healed. The camp is called Gilgal (translation: to roll, as in to roll away the reproach of Egypt from them). They celebrate the Passover there, and the day after the Passover, the manna ceases and they eat the fruit of the land in Canaan.

## 5b. The Commander of the Lord's Army

The commander of the Lord's army appears before Joshua with his sword drawn, and Joshua asks him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?" The commander replies that he is neither, and reveals who he is to Joshua. Joshua falls and worships. The commander gives Joshua the same command he gave to Moses, "Take the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy."

## Battles with the Canaanites

* * *

## 6. The Fall of Jericho

Jericho hears of the Israelites and closes off the city. The Lord tells Joshua to have the men march around the city for six days with seven priests blowing seven trumpets, and on the seventh day to have them march around seven times and blow the trumpet and shout, and the wall will come down. Joshua tells the people to do all the Lord commanded, and the wall falls down flat and they capture the city. The two spies bring out Rahab and her family. Joshua warns them that if they take anything from Jericho that is devoted to destruction as the Lord commanded, they too will be devoted to destruction (this principle is called cherem). The precious metals are put in the treasury of the house of the Lord. Joshua curses any man who rebuilds Jericho, and his fame is established in all the land.

## 7. Israel Defeated in Ai

Achan (from the tribe of Judah) steals some of the things the Lord devoted to destruction in Jericho, breaking the covenant. Joshua sends about 3,000 men into Ai, and about 36 of them are killed and the rest are chased as far as Shebarim and struck down. Joshua falls on his face and prays and God tells him he will turn away from them unless they destroy the devoted things. God tells Joshua to have the tribes come forward and that he will lead them to the perpetrator, and that the perpetrator and the devoted things shall be burned with fire. God leads Joshua to Achan, and Achan confesses to stealing a cloak from Shinar, 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels. They find the items in his tent and bring him and his family and all that he has to the Valley of Achor (translation: trouble) where they are stoned and burned. They pile a heap of stones on him as a reminder of Israel's potential for unfaithfulness.

## 8a. The Fall of Ai

The Lord tells Joshua to ambush the city of Ai, and he will deliver them into their hands and they are allowed to take spoil. Joshua takes 30,000 men into Ai and places 5,000 of them between Bethel and Ai to the west, and has the others go to north of the city. The king of Ai sees the 25,000 men and sends the whole city after them. They pretend to flee which draws them all out of the city and the Lord tells Joshua to stretch out his javelin towards Ai. This signals the 5,000 men to capture the city and set it on fire. When the rest of the troops see the smoke, they turn back and defeat the men of Ai (about 12,000 men). Joshua makes Ai a heap of ruins, hangs the king of Ai, and then buries him under a heap of stones.

## 8b. Joshua Renews the Covenant

Joshua builds the altar which contains the law on Mount Ebal as Moses commanded, and they offer burnt offerings and peace offerings there. Half of the people stand on Mount Ebal and the other half stand on Mount Gerizim, and Joshua reads the blessing and the curse and all of the Book of the Law before them just as Moses commanded.

## 9. The Gibeonite Deception

The Canaanite kings beyond the Jordan near the Great Sea (Mediterranean Sea) hear of Israel and join together to fight against them, but the Gibeonites (people of Gibeon, a city northwest of Jerusalem which is greater than Ai, also called Hivites) fear Israel and plan a ruse. They put on tattered clothes, bring dry and crumbled food, and go to Joshua at Gilgal and ask to make a covenant. They claim to have come from a distant country because of the Lord, and tell Joshua they've heard of all the Israelites have done. Joshua makes a covenant with them, and three days later they reach Gibeon and find out that it was a ruse. The leaders of Israel keep their word and don't attack the Gibeonites because of the covenant, and the people murmur against the leaders. Joshua confronts them and they confess to the ruse. Joshua makes them cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord.

## 10a. The Sun Stands Still

Adoni-zedk (king of Jerusalem) hears all that Israel has done and fears them greatly. He rallies Hoham (king of Hebron), Piram (king of Jarmuth), Japhia (king of Lachish), and Debir (king of Eglon) to strike Gibeon. The Gibeonites call for Israel's help. Joshua rallies the troops and they head from Gilgal to Gibeon, and the Lord delivers them into their hands. They chase them and strike them by way of Beth-horon as far as Azekah and Makkedah. While going down Beth-horon, the Lord strikes down the enemy with large hailstones from heaven (more of them die by hailstones than by the sword). Joshua prays in the sight of Israel that the Lord make the sun stand still until they take vengeance on their enemies. God answers his prayer and the account of the sun standing still is written in the Book of Jashar (an ancient book of poetic accounts or songs of the deeds of heroes). The Isralites return to the camp at Gilgal.

## 10b. Five Amorite Kings Executed

The five kings flee and hide in the cave at Makkedah, and Joshua has his men roll stones against the mouth of the cave and set men to guard it while they attack the rest of the enemy troops. After the enemy troops are defeated, Joshua brings the kings out of the cave and has his men put their feet on their necks (ancient symbol of dominance, making your enemies a footstool). Then Joshua hangs the five kings, throws them back into the cave, and captures Makkedah.

## 10c. Conquest of Southern Canaan

The Israelites go from Makkedah to Libnah and capture it. They go from Libnah to Lachish and capture it. Horam (king of Gezer) and his people go to fight Israel at Lachish, and the Israelites defeat them. They go from Lachish to Eglon and capture it. They go from Eglon to Hebron and capture it. They go from Hebron to Debir and capture it. Joshua and the Israelites capture all of southern Canaan (the Negeb, from Kadesh-barnea as far as Gaza, Goshen, as far as Gibeon). The Lord fought for Israel. The Israelites return to camp at Gilgal.

## 11. Conquests in Northern Canaan

Jabin (king of Hazor) gets word of Israel's conquest of southern Canaan and rallies all the Caananites of the north (Jobab king of Madon, the king of Shimron, the king of Achshap, the people south of Chinneroth, in Naphoth-dor, and in Mizpah) and they and their troops go to Merom to fight Israel. The Lord tells Joshua not to worry because he will deliver them into their hands. The Israelites strike them down and chase them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh, and strike them all down. Joshua captures Hazor and kills Jabin. They capture the north and devote all the cities to destruction. They burn Hazor. Joshua captures and devotes to destruction all the land in the north (the Negeb, Goshen, the Arabah, from Mount Halak as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon Below Mount Hermon), along with all the kings and inhabitants (except the Gibeonites). Joshua destroys all the Anakim the land (only some remain in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod). Joshua takes the whole land the Lord had spoken to Moses and gives the tribal land to the Israelites. They finally have rest from war.

## 12a. Kings Defeated by Moses

This section recounts the Transjordan territory captured by the Israelites under Moses, from the Valley of Arnon to Mount Heromon with all the Arabah eastward. They defeated king Sihon and king Og. Moses gave this land to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

## 12b. Kings Defeated by Joshua

This section recounts the land west of the Jordan captured by the Israelites under Joshua, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak. They defeated the king of Jericho, the king of Ai, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, the king of Gezer, the king of Debir, the king of Geder, the king of Hormah, the king of Arad, the king of Libnah, the king of Adullam, the king of Makkedah, the king of Bethel, the king of Tappuah, the king of Hepher, the king of Aphek, the king of Lasharon, the king of Madon, the king of Hazor, the king of Shimron-meron, the king of Achshaph, the king of Taanach, the king of Megiddo, the king of Kadesh, the king of Jokneam, the king of Dor, the king of Goiim, and the king of Tirzah (31 kings).

## Joshua Divides Up the Land

* * *

## 13a. Land Still to Be Conquered

Joshua is old, but the Lord tells him there is still much land to possess, particularly along the coast and in the far northâ€”the regions of the Philistines (Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron) and the Geshurites from Shihor to Ekron, the regions of the Avvim in the south, Mearah, Aphek, the land of the Gebalites, from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, from Baal-gad to Lebo-hamath. The Lord tells Joshua he will drive them out before the people of Israel and to divide up the tribal land.

## 13b. East of the Jordan

This section recounts the land Moses gave to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh east of the Jordan, from Areor to Bashan. The Israelites *did not* drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites, they still dwell in the midst of Israel. Levi gets no inheritance as previously mentioned. Reuben gets the land from Aroer to Heshbon. Gad gets the land from Heshbon to Mahanaim. Half of Manasseh gets the land from Mahanaim to Bashan.

## 14. West of the Jordan / Caleb's Inheritance

Joshua, Eleazar, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes give the other nine and a half tribes their land inheritance by lot and by the size of the tribe as the Lord commanded. Caleb, who is now 85 and still going strong, goes to Joshua and reminds him that he was faithful when Moses sent him as one of the 12 spies, and asks for Hebron (formerly Kiriath-arba, Arba being the greatest of the Anakim and the father of Anak) and says he will drive out the Anakim there. Caleb drives out the Anakim and the Israelites have a rest from war.

## 15. The Allotment for Judah

Judah, the largest tribe, gets the land from just south of Jerusalem down along the Dead Sea as far south as the wilderness of Zin south of Kadesh-barnea to the coast all the way up to Jabneel. Caleb captures Hebron and says whoever captures Debir (formerly Kiriath-sepher) will marry his daughter Achash. Caleb's nephew Othniel captures it and marries her. Since Debir is a desert (Negeb), Achash asks Caleb for springs of water. He gives her the upper and lower springs. This section lists the cities belonging to Judah. The people of Judah couldn't drive out all the Jebusites in Jerusalem (most likely because it is a hard city to take as the inhabitants have a military advantageâ€”Jerusalem is on a hill surrounded by three deep valleys which resembles the Hebrew letter *shin*, a sacred letter and the first letter of the word *Shaddai* meaning "God Almighty").

## 16. The Allotment for Ephraim

Ephraim gets the land which includes Bethel and Ai, from Tappuah in the north down on the east side touching Jericho then over to the brook Kanah in the west and then up to Michmethath. The Israelites *did not* drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, and still dwell in the midst of Israel and were made to do forced labor.

## 17a. The Allotment for Manasseh

Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh who was the firstborn of Joseph, gets Gilead and Bashan because he was a man of war. Allotments were made to the rest of the people of Manasseh, the sons (Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida), and the daughters of Zelophehad (Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah). Their allotment was ten portions plus Gilead and Bashan on the other side of the Jordan. The second half of Manasseh's territory west of the Jordan went from the brook Kanah and the Mediterranean Sea in the west, up to Dor in the north, over to Beth-shean in the east, and down and around westward touching Tappuah. Again, Israel did not drive out all the Canaanites here, but put them to forced labor.

## 17b. Ephraim and Manasseh Go To Joshua

The people of Joseph go to Joshua and ask for an additional lot (Ephraim and Manasseh were initially given one lot). He tells them to go to the forest and clear out the land (the Perizzites and Rephaim live there). The people of Joseph worry because the Canaanites there have chariots of iron. Joshua assures them they will drive out the Canaanites there.

## 18a. Shiloh / Allotment of the Remaining Land

The whole congregation of Israel goes to Shiloh and they set up the tent of meeting there (the first time it's set up in the promised land). There are still seven tribes that do not have a land allotment. Joshua calls for each tribe to appoint three men to go and scout out the land and to divide it into seven portions so he can cast lots before the Lord and appropriate the land.

## 18b. The Inheritance for Benjamin

The first lot comes out for Benjamin, and they get a small plot of land including the mountains of Jerusalem located between the people of Judah in the south and the people of Joseph in the north. Their land goes from Jericho down south of Jerusalem over to Beth-horon in the west, and then up and just south of Bethel in the north. The rest of the section lists the cities belonging to Benjamin.

## 19a. The Inheritance for Simeon

The second lot comes out for Simoeon, and they get land in the midst of the people of Judah (Judah's land inheritance was too large for them). Their land is a plot of desert in the south and goes from Sharuhen on the west to Hormah on the east and includes Beersheba. Their cities are listed in this section.

## 19b. The Inheritance for Zebulun

The third lot comes out for Zebulun, and they get a small plot of land in the north in a lush green area which goes from Sarid in the south up to Hannathon in the north (their land was sandwiched between the tribes of the north with West Manasseh and Issachar to the south and Asher and Naphtali to the north). Their cities are listed in this section.

## 19c. The Inheritance for Issachar

The fourth lot comes out for Issachar, and they get a small fertile area near the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan river which goes from Beth-shemesh in the north east down along the Jordan and around to Jazreel in the south, then west to En-gannim, and then north to Mount Tabor (their land was north of West Manasseh and south of Zebulun). Their cities are listed in this section.

## 19d. The Inheritance for Asher

The fifth lot comes out for Asher, and they gets land along the Mediterranean coastline to the north which goes from Helkath in the south over to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea touching Carmel, and up to Sidon in the north (their land was west of Naphtali and north of West Manasseh and Zebulun). Their cities are listed in this section.

## 19e. The Inheritance for Naphtali

The sixth lot comes out for Naphtali, and they get the mountainous north including a mountain range that reaches over 9,000 feet (it snows there in the winter), as well as flowers and palm trees near the Sea of Galilee, located north of Issachar and Zebulun and east of Asher with the Jordan and Chinnereth (Sea of Galilee) on the east. Their cities are listed in this section.

## 19f. The Inheritance for Dan

The seventh lot comes out for Dan, and they get a gorgeous coastline area near the major port of Joppa (near modern day Tel Aviv) which goes from Aijalon in the southeast out to the coast, up to Joppa, and up to Gath-rimmon in the north (their land is north of Judah, west of Benjamin and Ephraim, and south of West Manasseh). Their cities are listed in this section.

## 19g. The Inheritance for Joshua

After the land is divided at the tent of meeting in Shiloh, the Lord commands the people to give Joshua an inheritance. He is given Timnath-serah (a.k.a. Khirbet Tibnah or Timnath-heres) in the quiet and secluded hill country in the southwest of Ephraim just north of Jerusalem (his age and the fact he received a more isolated area indicates his years may be drawing to a close). The Israelites have finished dividing the land.

## 20. The Cities of Refuge

The Lord commands Joshua to set up the six cities of refuge the which the Lord commanded to Moses, and they set apart the following cities: Kedesh in Galilee (Naphtali), Shechem (Ephraim), Hebron (Judah), Bezer (Reuben), Ramoth (Gad), and Golan in Bashan (Manasseh).

## 21. Cities and Pasturelands Allotted to Levi

The heads of the houses of the Levites go to Joshua and Eleazar in Shiloh and request the 48 cities that the Lord spoke of to Moses. The following list is the order in which the tribes of Levi came up by lot (an underline means it's a city of refuge):

- **Kohath Descendants of Aaron** (13 cities)

  - Judah / Simeon (9 cities)

    - Hebron
    - Libnah

    - Jokneam
    - Kartah
    - Dimnah
    - Nahalal

This marks the fulfillment of the Lord's promise to give Israel all the land he swore to their fathers.

## 22a. The Eastern Tribes Return Home

Joshua calls the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh East and tells them they may return home since they have fulfilled their obligations of war and have obeyed the word of the Lord. He reminds them to love the Lord and obey his commandments when they return home. They return home with wealth and Joshua tells them to divide it amongst themselves. The eastern tribes depart from Shiloh and return home.

## 22b. The Eastern Tribes' Altar of Witness

When the eastern tribes return home, they build a large altar by the Jordan. The rest of Israel worries they have broken the covenant, so they go over ready for war. Phinehas and ten chiefs go to Gilead to question the eastern tribes. They worry God will be angry with the whole congregation, and offer for them to live in the west where the tabernacle is instead, and remind them of Achan's rebellion. They respond by saying they only built the altar to remind future generations of the Lord since they are separated from the rest of Israel by the Jordan. They assure the rest of Israel that the altar is not for offerings (since that was only to be done at the sanctuary), but is built to be a witness (a visible monument) between them to remind them and future generations that the Lord is God. Phinehas and the chiefs realize they built the altar for good and they return home telling the good news to the rest of the people of Israel. The altar is named Witness.

## Joshua's Final Words

* * *

## 23. Joshua's Charge to Israel's Leaders

An aging Joshua calls all of Israel's elders, heads, judges, and officers and reminds them al the Lord has done for them, tells them the Lord will drive out the enemies from the rest of the land God promised them, and tells them that they are to follow all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses. He tells them that it is the Lord who fights for them. He warns them not to mix with the Canaanites or bow down to their gods. He reminds them that God has kept his promises to them, and warns them of the consequences of turning away from God.

## 24a. The Covenant Renewal at Shechem

Joshua gathers all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and calls up the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers, and recaps Israel's history. He begins with how Terah and Nahor, who worshiped other gods, had Abraham who the Lord led through Canaan. He recounts how Abraham had Isaac who had Jacob and Esau. He then recaps from the exodus from Egypt and the journey through the wilderness to the Lord's deliverance of their enemies into their hands in the promised land. Joshua tells them that the Lord gave them the fruit of the land that they themselves did not plant. He tells them to put away the gods of their fathers and to serve the Lord in sincerity and faithfulness. The people agree to serve the Lord their God. Joshua warns them of the consequences of breaking the covenant, and the people agree to obey the covenant and obey the Lord. Joshua writes the covenant in a book called the Book of the Law of God, and sets up a large stone under the terebinth tree by the sanctuary as a witness. The people return to their homes.

## 24b. Joshua's Death / Joseph's Burial / Eleazar's Death

Joshua dies at the age of 110 (like Joseph) and they bury him at his home in Timnath-serah (hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash). They bury Joseph at Shechem to fulfill their promise to him (Shechem was the land that Jacob bought from Hamor for a hundred pieces of moneyâ€”Jacob had Joseph who had Ephraim, so Ephraim inherited the land and Joseph was buried thereâ€”Joshua was a descendant of Ephraim). Eleazar dies and they bury him at Gibeah (the town of his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim).
