## Synopsis

While this is the only book in scripture that doesn't mention God's name, it clearly displays God's providence at work. One hundred years after the Babylonian exile, there is a jewish community living in Persia's capital Susa. Mordecai, a descendant of Saul, and his cousin <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="ester" text="Esther" /> (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hadasa" text="Hadasa" />*), whom he cares for like a daughter, hide their jewish identity. Esther is elevated to queen, and Mordecai saves the king's life. Mordecai refuses to bow to Haman, the second in command, and Haman looks to annihilate all the Jews in Persia. The king remembers how Mordecai saves his life, and Mordecai is elevated to second in command, while Haman is executed. The Jews then defend themselves against their Persian enemies, and the first feast of Purim is celebrated.
