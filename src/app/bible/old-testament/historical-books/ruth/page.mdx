## Synopsis

The story of Naomi, <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="ruth" text="Ruth" />, and Boaz, and the birth of Obed, who is in the ancestry of King David. This book examines how God is involved in the day-to-day joys and hardships of our lives, explores the interplay of God's purpose and human decisions, and highlights how loyalty can carry us from tragedy and death to joy and birth.

## 1. Naomi Widowed

In the days of the judges, there was a famine in Israel. A couple named Elimelech and Naomi (which means pleasant) who are Ephrathites (people of Ephratah, the old name of Bethlehem in Judah) and their two sons Mahlon and Chilion go to Moab where the sons take as wives Orpah and Ruth. They all live there for 10 years. Naomi's husband and sons die, and she hears that the Lord has given food to Israel, so she decides to return to the land of Judah. She tells Orpah and Ruth to stay in Moab because she is too old to have more children to give them husbands. Naomi says the hand of the Lord has gone out against her (she mistakenly interprets her situation as God's enmity). Orpah listens and stays, but Ruth says she will go where Naomi goes and her people shall be her people and her God shall be her God. Ruth says she will die where Naomi dies, and that nothing but death will separate them. They return to Bethlehem in the beginning of the barley harvest, and Naomi changes her name to Mara (which means bitter).

## 2. Ruth Meets Boaz

Ruth goes to glean from the fields and ends up in the fields of Boaz, Naomi's righteous relative from the clan of Elimelech. He finds out about the loyalty Ruth has shown to Naomi and protects her, gives her food and drinks, and asks her to glean from no other field. He tells her the Lord is repaying her for what she has done and that the Lord is her refuge. Ruth gleans in the fields and returns to Naomi with barley. She tells her about Boaz, and Naomi says that the Lord's kindness "has not forsaken the living or the dead," and tells her that Boaz is their relative and family redeemer. Ruth lives with Naomi and gleans in the fields of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest.

## 3. Ruth and Boaz at the Threshing Floor

Naomi tells Ruth to wash up and anoint herself and to meet Boaz at the threshing floor. She does so, and Boaz is startled. She tells him he is their redeemer (essentially proposing). He tells her she is a righteous woman and that although it is true he is a redeemer, there is a closer relative to Naomi. He says he will be the redeemer if the relative declines. In the morning, he gives her six measures of barley and she returns to Naomi to tell her the news.

## 4. Boaz Redeems Ruth

Boaz goes to the gate of the city with the nearest redeemer and ten elders of the city. The nearest redeemer declines because he is worried about his current estate. Boaz officially declares he will be the redeemer. The people at the gate say, "May the Lord make the woman…like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem, and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah…" Boaz and Ruth have a son, and the women say to Naomi, "Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you without a redeemer." They tell her the child's name will be renowned in Israel and that he will be a "restorer of life." They tell her that Ruth is more to her than seven sons (seven representing completion or fullness—this shows that Naomi's situation wasn't enmity from God, but rather a way to restore life and joy). They name the child Obed, and he is the grandfather of David.
