## Synopsis

Nehemiah (Hebrew: "The Lord Comforts") is a Jewish cupbearer for the king of Persia Artaxerxes who gets word that the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are destroyed by fire. He repents and prays, and the king allows him to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the wall. As he leads the people in rebuilding of the wall, he is met with resistance, opposition, and conspiracy, but his faith in God allows him to persevere. He is made governor, and limits the taxes, debts, and burdens placed on the people as they are rebuilding the wall. With a weapon in one hand, and their tools in the other, the people miraculously finish rebuilding the wall in just 52 days. The people gather together, Ezra reads and teaches the Law, and the Feast of Booths is celebrated. The people of Israel confess their sins, and make a covenant to walk in God's Law. Nehemiah finds out that the temple was being neglected, that Eliashib the high priest allows one of Israel's enemies into the house of God and that he had married a foreigner, that people were working and setting up markets on the Sabbath. In response, he chases Eliashib away, closes the gates of the city, beats people, and pulls out their hair in attempts to bring them back under the Mosaic Law.
