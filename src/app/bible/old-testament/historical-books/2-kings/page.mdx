## Synopsis

Part 2 of Kings (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="melachim" text="Melachim" />*), which is the story of the long line of kings that come after David, their failures, the dividing of the kingdom, Jerusalem's demise, and Israel's exile to Babylon.

## 1. Elijah Denounces Ahaziah

After Ahab dies, Moab rebels against Israel. Ahaziah falls through the lattice in his upper chamber and is injured. He sends men to inquire of Baal-zebub (lord of the flies, god of Ekron, a Philistine city). On their way, Elijah meets them and prophesies his death. Ahaziah sends fifty men to confront Elijah, and the fire of the Lord consumes them. He sends fifty more, and once again the Lord's fire consumes them. He sends another fifty, and this time the fifty humble themselves, and Elijah repeats the prophecy of Ahaziah's death. Ahaziah dies in the third year of Joram's reign over Judah, and his brother Jehoram takes the throne in Israel since Ahaziah had no son. Ahaziah's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

## 2a. Elijah Taken to Heaven

While Elijah and Elisha are at Gilgal (near Jericho), it is revealed that the Lord is going to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah tells Elisha to stay behind, but Elisha says he will not leave him. The Lord sends Elijah to Bethel, and when they arrive the prophets there speak of Elijah's death, but out of respect, Elisha has them keep quiet. Elijah tells Elisha to stay behind, but Elisha says he will not leave him. The Lord sends Elijah to Jericho, and when they arrive the prophets again speak of Elijah's death, and out of respect, Elisha has them keep quiet. Elijah tells Elisha to stay behind, but he again says he will not leave him. The Lord sends Elijah to the Jordan. When they arrive, he rolls up his cloak and strikes the water and it parts so they can cross. Elisha asks Elijah for a double portion of his spirit. Elijah says that if he sees him as he is being taken, then it will be so. Chariots of fire and horses of fire separate the two of them, and Elijah goes up by a whirlwind to heaven, and Elisha sees it and says, "My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!" He tears his clothes in two and takes Elijah's cloak. He strikes the water saying, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?" And the water parts so he can cross.

## 2b. Elisha Succeeds Elijah

The prophets of Jericho see that the spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha and bow to him. They think that Elijah has been cast off by the storm, and they want to send fifty men to go find him. Elisha tells them not to, but they insist. They don't find him, and Elijah reminds them he told them not to go. The water in the city is bad, and the land is unfruitful (Hiel rebuilt Jericho under Ahab's reign despite Joshua's curse). Elisha asks for a new bowl with salt in it. Elisha throws the salt into the spring and says, "Thus says the Lord, I have healed this water." and the water is healed. He goes to Bethel (the focal point of Israel's apostasy) where a large group of boys disrespectfully mock him and call him "baldhead". Elisha curses them and two she-bears come out of the woods and tear 42 of them apart. He goes to Mount Carmel (the scene of Elijah's great victory), and then returns to Samaria.

## 3. Moab Rebels Against Israel

In the 18th year of Jehoshaphat's reign, Ahab's son Jehoram becomes king over Israel. Even though he gets rid of the pillar of Baal that his father made, he still does what is evil in the sight of the Lord and leads Israel to apostasy. After Ahab's death, Mesha, the king of Moab, rebels against Israel, so Jehoram gathers all Israel, and allies with Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom. They march around the wilderness of Edom for 7 days, then they run out of water. Jehoshaphat seeks the Lord's counsel via Elisha. Elisha rebukes Jehoram and the king of Edom, but seeks the Lord on behalf of Jehoshaphat. Elisha calls for a musician, who plays, and then Elijah prophesies that without seeing wind or rain, the Lord will fill a dry streambed full of water, and deliver the Moabites into their hand. The next morning at the time of offering the sacrifice, water comes from the direction of Edom and fills the country with water. The Moabites arrive and see the water, which is red like blood, and they think the Israelites struck each other down. They come to gather the spoil, and the Israelites defeat them and overthrow their cities. Mesha sacrifices his son to their god (Chemosh), and the Moabites rally in anger. The Israelites return home.

## 4a. Elisha and the Widow's Oil

The wife of one of the sons of the prophets comes to Elisha saying her husband has died and that the creditor has come to take her two children as slaves. All that she has left is a jar of oil. Elisha tells her to borrow vessels from all her neighbors and pour the oil into them. The oil from the jar flows until all the vessels are full. Elisha tells her to sell the oil to pay off the debt and to provide for her sons.

## 4b. Elisha and the Shunammite Woman

Elisha goes to Shunem (north of Jezreel) where a wealthy woman lives. She feeds him whenever he passes by until one day she and her husband build a small room on the roof for him. He asks his servant Gehazi to ask the woman what can be done for her. Gehazi finds out she has no son and her husband is old. Elisha prophesies she will have a son, and she does in the following spring.

## 4c. Elisha Raises the Shunammite's Son

When the Shunammite woman's son is a little older, he goes out to his father in the field with severe head pain. The father's servant carries him into his mother, and he dies in her lap. She lays him on the bed, and asks her husband for a servant and a donkey to go to Elisha. It's not the time of year one normally goes to a prophet, so he asks why. She says all is well, and heads out with the servant on the donkey. They arrive at Mount Carmel and Elisha sends Gehazi to meet her. She tells Gehazi all is well, and goes to Elisha where she falls at his feet in distress. Gehazi tries to push her away, but Elisha sees her distress and says the Lord hasn't revealed this to him, so he needs to hear her out. She tells him the news and he sends Gehazi with his staff to lay it on the face of the child. Gehazi comes back saying there is no sign of life. Elisha comes to the house, prays to the Lord, puts his mouth on his mouth, eyes on his eyes, and hands on his hands, and stretches himself out on the child. The child becomes warm. He walks back and forth in the house, stretches himself out on the child again, and he sneezes 7 times and opens his eyes. He has Gehazi bring in the woman, who falls at his feet, picks up her son and walks out.

## 4d. Elisha Purifies the Deadly Stew

There is a famine in the land, and Elisha goes to Gilgal where the sons of the prophets are sitting before him. He has his servant prepare a stew for the men, but he gathers wild gourds which makes the stew deadly and the men cannot eat it. Elisha throws flour into the pot (just as he threw the salt in the spring), and the stew is purified so the men can eat. A man comes from Baal-shalishah (near Gilgal) and brings Elisha bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain. Elisha says to give it to the men so they may eat, but the man doesn't know how the food will feed 100 men. He says the Lord says they shall eat and have some left, and they do.

## 5. Naaman Healed of Leprosy

Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Syria, is leprous. His wife has an Israelite servant who is a little girl. She tells him to go to Elisha to be cured. Naaman tells the king of Syria, and the king sends him to Israel with a letter to Israel's king, silver, gold, and clothing. Jehoram reads the letter, tears his clothes, and takes it as quarreling since he finds the request to cure him impossible. Elisha finds out and asks Jehoram why he has torn his clothes, and tells him to send Naaman to him so that he may know there is a prophet in Israel. Naaman arrives, and Elisha tells him to wash in the Jordan seven times. Naaman expects some kind of ritual with a waving of a staff by the prophet, and claims he could have just bathed in the waters of Damascus, so he storms away. Naaman's servants urge him to listen to Elisha, so he washes in the Jordan seven times, and his flesh is restored like the flesh of a little child. Naaman vows to worship the Lord alone, and tries to give Elisha gifts, but Elisha refuses since it was an act of the Lord and not him. Naaman asks for earth to build an altar to the Lord, and asks to be pardoned when he is required as commander to bow in the house of Rimmon (Baal-hadad, the storm god), and Elisha says, "Go in peace." Gehazi runs after him and makes up a story about two sons of the prophets to get gold and clothing. Elisha curses him and he becomes leprous.

## 6a. The Axe Head Recovered

The sons of the prophets look to build a dwelling place and ask Elisha to go with them to the Jordan to cut down the trees for wood. As one of the men is felling, his axe head falls into the water. He cries out to Elishsa because he had borrowed the axe. Elisha throws a stick in the water, the iron axe head floats, and the man retrieves it.

## 6b. Horses and Chariot of Fire

The king of Syria is warring with Israel and goes to camp against Israel, but Elisha warns Jehoram and saves Israel a number of times. The king of Syria gets angry and sends an army to Dothan (10 miles from Samaria) to kill Elisha. Elisha's servant sees the army and panics, but Elisha prays for his eyes to be opened, and the servant sees that the mountains are full of horses and chariots of fire and that the army of the Lord is surrounding Elisha. The army goes to attack, but Elisha prays that they be struck with blindness, and the Lord strikes them blind. Elisha tells them they are not in the right place, and leads them to Samaria where they are surrounded by the king's army. The king wants to kill them, but Elisha tells them to treat them as captives, feed them, and send them away. After they are sent away, they don't return to raid Israel.

## 6c. Ben-hadad's Siege of Samaria

Ben-hadad, king of Syria, uses his whole army to besiege Samaria, and there is a great famine in Samaria. As Jehoram is passing by, a woman cries out to him for help. He says, "If the Lord will not help you, how shall I help you?" The woman tells him that things are so dire that they have resorted to cannibalism, and that she and her neighbor has eaten her son, and that they are about to eat her neighbor's son. Jehoram tears his clothes and has on sackcloth, and he vows to decapitate Elisha. Elisha is sitting with the elders, and Elisha knows the king has dispatched a messenger to come for Elisha's head, so he tells the elders to shut the door and lock him out. The messenger arrives and says, "This trouble is from the Lord! Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?"

## 7. Elisha Promises Food

The Lord says through Elisha that there will be food again in Samaria. Jehoram's captain doubts the Word of the Lord and says, "If the Lord himself should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?" Elisha tells him that he shall see it with his own eyes, but not eat of it. The scene changes to four leprous men at the gate of Samaria. They have no hope left, so they decide to go to the camp of the Syrians. Little do they know, God made the Syrian army hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a great army so that they would flee in fear. When the leprous men arrive, they see the abandoned camp, eat, drink, and begin taking the spoil. In the middle of doing so, they realize what they are doing is wrong and decide to tell the Jehoram. Jehoram thinks the abandoned camp is a ruse, so he sends two horsemen into the camp to check things out. When they see the camp is truly abandoned, the Israelites plunder the camp, and the people of Israel once again have food as foretold by Elisha. Jehoram's captain is trampled at the gate of the city, also fulfilling Elisha's prophecy.

## 8a. The Shunammite's Land Restored

Elisha tells the Shunammite woman to flee because there will be a famine in the land. She flees to Syria for 7 years, and returns to appeal to Jehoram to get back her land. As Gehazi is talking to Jehoram about Elisha bringing the Shunammite woman's son back to life, she walks in and appeals to him for her land. Jehoram appoints an official for her to restore all that was hers including the land and produce of the fields.

## 8b. Hazael Murders Ben-hadad

Elisha comes to Damascus, and Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, is sick. Ben-hadad sends Hazael to inquire of the Lord regarding his sickness via Elisha. Elisha tells Hazael that Ben-hadad shall recover, but surely die. Elisha weeps and tells Hazael that the Lord has shown him that Hazael will do terrible things to Israel and will become king of Syria. Hazael comes back and kills Ben-hadad by putting a wet bed cloth over his face, and becomes king (thus fulfilling part of the prophecy the Lord revealed to Elijah at Mount Sinai).

## 8c. Joram Reigns in Judah

In the 5th year of Jehoram's reign in Israel, Jehoshaphat's son Joram begins to reign in Judah. He is 32 when he becomes king, and reigns for 8 years in Jerusalem. He walks in the way of Ahab, for he married the daughter of Ahab, and does what is evil in the sight of the Lord. The Lord spares his house for David's sake. Edom and Libnah revolt during his reign. His story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. He dies and is buried in the city of David, and his son Ahaziah reigns in his place.

## 8c. Ahaziah Reigns in Judah

In the 12th year of Jehoram's reign in Israel, Joram's son Ahaziah begins to reign in Judah. He is 22 when he becomes king, and reigns for only one year. His mother is Athalia, the granddaughter of Omri, and he walks in the evil ways of the house of Ahab. He goes with Jehoram to make war with Hazael, now king of Syria, at Ramoth-gilead. Jehoram is wounded at Ramah by the Syrians, and returns to Jezreel to heal. Ahaziah goes to Jezreel to see him.

## 9. Jehu Anointed King of Israel

Elisha tells one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, son of Nimshi, king of Israel. The young man goes to Ramoth-gilead where Jehu is meeting with the army, anoints him as king, and tells him to destroy the house of Ahab, and to kill Jezebel to avenge on her the blood of the prophets. The men quickly put their garments on the steps under him, blow the trumpets, and proclaim him king. Jehu and his men go to Jezreel where Jehoram is healing, and where Ahaziah went to meet him. Jehoram sends two horsemen to meet him, but Jehu convinces them to ride with his army. Finally, Jehoram and Ahaziah ride in their chariots to meet Jehu. Jehoram asks him if there is peace, and he says, "What peace can there be, so long as the whorings and the sorceries of your mother Jezebel are so many?" Jehoram flees, but Jehu shoots him with an arrow which hits his heart. Jehu tells his men to put him on the land of Naboth where his father Ahab killed him and stole his vineyard. Ahaziah flees, Jehu chases and shoots him, and he dies in Megiddo. They bury him in the city of David with his fathers. Jehu goes back to Jezebel at Jezreel. She sees him out the window, and sarcastically calls him Zimri (the king who murdered the previous king Elah and only ruled for 7 days). Jehu asks the eunuchs who are with her if they are on his side, and they throw her out the window and she dies. Jehu goes in to eat and drink, and she is left to be eaten by dogs, thus fulfilling the prophecy of Elijah regarding her death.

## 10a. Jehu Slaughters Ahab's Descendants

Ahab has 70 sons in Samaria, so Jehu writes letters to all the elders of the city saying that they should choose their best men to fight for the throne, but they are afraid of Jehu, so they tell him they will do all that he asks of them. He tells them to deliver to him the heads of Ahab's sons. Ahab's sons are slaughtered and their heads are brought to Jehu at Jezreel. He has them put in two heaps at the entrance of the gate of the city. He absorbs the guilt and tells the people that the prophecy of the Lord through Elijah will be fulfilled, and that nothing can thwart the Word of God. Then he strikes down all the rest of the house of Ahab in Jezreel. He goes to Samaria, and on the way, runs into relatives of Ahaziah at Beth-eked who came to visit the royal princes and the queen mother. He has them slaughtered there. Jehu meets Jehonadab, son of Rechab, and Jehu asks him if his heart is true to him. He says it is, so Jehu says, "Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord." So he rides in his chariot to Samaria. When Jehu arrives, he kills all who remained of the house of Ahab in Samaria, thus fulfilling the prophecy of the Lord through Elijah regarding the house of Ahab.

## 10b. Jehu Strikes Down the Prophets of Baal

Jehu pretends to call for a worship to Baal. He gathers all the prophets of Baal and his worshipers and priests at the house of Baal. He and Jehonadab go into the house of Baal and have the people make sure there are no servants of the Lord there. Jehu stations 80 men outside and has the men go in and strike everyone of them down. Then they burn down the house of Baal, and turn it into a latrine.

## 10c. Jehu Reigns in Israel

Although Jehu does what is right in the eyes of the Lord by destroying the house of Ahab and the prophets of Baal, he walks in the way of Jeroboam, is not careful to follow the law of the Lord, and leads Israel to sin. He leaves the two golden calves in Dan and Bethel, however, because of his eradication of Baal worship, the Lord tells him that his sons of the fourth generation will sit on the throne of Israel. The Lord then begins to cut off the people of Israel. Hazael defeats Israel in the land east of the Jordan. Jehu's story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. He reigns for 28 years. He dies and is buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz reigns in his place.

## 11a. Athalia Reigns in Judah

When Athaliah finds out about her son Ahaziah's death, she kills all the royal family of the house of David, but Jehosheba (also called Jehoshabeath, king Joram's daughter, Ahaziah's sister, and wife of priest Jehoiada) hides Ahaziah's infant son Joash in the temple where he stays for six years. Althalia reigns over the land.

## 11b. Joash Anointed King in Judah

When Joash is 7, Jehoiada brings all the captains and the guards to the temple and makes a covenant with them. Of those who come off duty on the Sabbath, he assigns one third to be gatekeepers, one third to be at the king's house, and one third to be at the Gate of Sur (a.k.a. gate of Shallecheth, a.k.a the Gate of the Foundation, a gate in the wall that surrounded the temple precincts). They are charged with protecting Joash and putting anyone who approaches him to death. He gives them the shields from the temple which had been King David's, and they stand ready with their weapons. Jehoiada brings out Joash and puts the crown on his head and gives him the testimony, and proclaims him king. The people cheer and say, "Long live the king!" Athaliah hears the cheering and sees Joash standing by the pillar as was tradition, and yells out, "Treason!" Jehoiada commands the captains to take her away, and she is taken to horses' entrance to the king's house and is put to death. Jehoiada makes a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people. The people go and tear down the house of Baal and kill Mattan the priest of Baal. Joash is marched from the temple to the king's house, and there is rejoicing and peace in Judah.

## 12. Joash Reigns in Judah

Joash begins to reign when he is 7, and reigns for 40 years in Jerusalem. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord. The high places, however, are not taken away. Joash plans to repair the temple (which had been neglected in the days of Baal worship) using money dedicated to the Lord and from a census tax, and charges the priests with the task. They fail to do so, so Joash and Jehoiada rebuke them, and they agree to take no more money. Jehoiada creates a chest in which the funds are to be collected, and the priests are to give the money directly to the workmen who are to repair the temple. Only a very humble restoration of the temple is done. Hazael, king of Syria, takes Gath (west of Jerusalem), and goes to take Jerusalem, but Joash takes all sacred gifts and all the gold from the temple and gives it to him. The story of Joash is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. He is assassinated in the Millo by his servants Jozacar and Jehozabad, and buried in the city of David. His son Amaziah reigns in his place.

## 13a. Jehoahaz Reigns in Israel

In the 23rd year of Joash's reign in Judah, Jehu's son Jehoahaz begins to reign in Israel in Samaria. He reigns 17 years. He does what is evil in the sigh of the Lord, and walks in the way of Jeroboam. Israel is continually given into the hand of Syria under the rule of Hazael and his son Ben-hadad. Jehoahaz seeks the favor of the Lord, and the Lord has mercy because they are oppressed by Syria. They escape from Syrian oppression, but continue to sin. The Asherah remain in Samaria. Israel's army is whittled down to a mere 50 horsemen, 10 chariots, and 10 foot soldiers. The story of Jehoahaz is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. He dies, is buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoash reigns in his place.

## 13b. Jehoash Reigns in Israel

In the 37th year of Joash's reign in Judah, Jehoahaz's son Jehoash begins to reign in Israel. He reigns 16 years. He does what is evil in the sight of the Lord, walking in the ways of Jeroboam. He fights with Amaziah, king of Judah, dies, and is buried in Samaria. Jeroboam reigns in his place.

## 13c. The Death of Elisha

As Elisha is dying, Jehoash goes to him. Elisha has him draw his bow toward the east and fire it. Elisha says, "The Lord's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria!" He says they shall fight in Aphek (east of the Transfordan territory) and defeat them. He tells Jehoash to strike the ground with his arrows, but Jehoash enthusiastically does it three times, Elisha says because he has only done it three times, they shall only defeat Syria three times. Elisha dies and is buried. Later, a man is thrown into Elisha's grave, and as soon as he touches the bones of Elisha, he is revived. Hazael, king of Syria, oppresses Israel all the days of Jehoahaz, but has mercy because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Hazael dies and Ben-hadad, his son, reigns in his place in Syria. Jehoash takes back the cities Hazael had taken, and Israel defeats Syria three times as prophesied.

## 14a. Amaziah Reigns in Judah

In the second year of Jehoash's reign in Israel, Joash's son Amaziah takes the throne in Judah. He is 25 when he begins to reign, and reigns for 29 years in Jerusalem. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord, but not like David. He doesn't remove the high places in Judah. He kills Jozacar and Jehozabad for killing his father, but does not kill their sons according to the law in which each one is to die for his own sin. He defeats the Edomites in the Valley of Salt (south of the Dead Sea), takes Sela, and renames it Joktheel. He sends messengers to confront Jehoash, and Jehoash responds with a parable of a thistle and a cedar, saying that Judah is overly confident after their recent victory, and that it is best if they stayed home. Amaziah doesn't listen and they battle at Beth-shamesh, which belonged to Judah. Israel defeats Judah, captures Amaziah, breaks down the wall of Jerusalem, takes all the gold, silver, and vessels from the temple and the king's house, and returns to Samaria. The story of Jehoash is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. Jehoash dies, and his son Jeroboam II reigns in his place. Amaziah lives 15 years after the death of Jehoash. His story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. The people conspire against him and he flees to Lachish (a heavily-fortified city in Judah), but they find and kill him. He is brought back and buried in the city of David. They make his son Uzziah (Azariah) king, and he builds Elath (a major trade route north of the Red Sea).

## 14b. Jeroboam II Reigns in Israel

In the 15th year of Amaziah's reign in Judah, Jeroboam II begins to reign in Israel. He reigns 41 years, and does what is evil in the sight of the Lord.

## 17b. The Fall of Israel

In the 9th year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captures Samaria and carries the Israelites away to Assyria and places them in Halah, the Harbor, the river of Gozan, and the cities of the Medes (places scattered widely over the Assyrian empire).

## 17c. Exile Because of Idolatry

It is made clear that Israel's exile to Assyria was because of their egregious idolatry and apostasy for which God sent prophets who Israel blatantly and stubbornly ignored. Only the tribe of Judah is left in the land. Judah, however, also did not keep the commandments of the Lord, but walked in the way of Israel. Thus, it is said that God rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them until they were exiled. Going back to when the kingdom split, God tore Israel from the house of David, but they chose Jeroboam as their king, and he drove them from following the Lord, and made them commit great sin. They did not depart from this sin, therefore, they were exiled from the land to Assyria.

## 17d. Assyria Resettles Samaria

The king of Assyria brings people from Babylon Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim to settle in the cities of Samaria. They do not fear the Lord, so he sends lions among them, which kill some of them. The king of Assyria brings an Israelite priest back to the land to Bethel to teach the law of the Lord. There is full-blown syncretism as each nation still makes gods of their own and puts their shrines in the high places. This syncretism also involves child sacrifice.

## 18. Hezekiah Reigns in Judah

In the third year of Hoshea's reign in Israel, Hezekiah begins to reign. He's 25 when he takes the throne, and reigns 29 years in Jerusalem. He does right in the eyes of the Lord according to all that David had done. He removes the high places, pillars, and Asherah in Jerusalem. He also breaks the bronze serpent (Nehushtan) that Moses made in the desert because the people began worshiping it. It is said, "He trusted in the Lord, God of Israel, so that there was none like him among all the kings of Judah after him, nor among those who were before  him. For he held fast to the Lord. He did not depart from following Him, but kept the commandments that the Lord commanded Moses. And the Lord was with him; wherever he went out, he prospered." He rebels against Assyria and strikes down the Philistines as far as Gaza. In the fourth year of his reign, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, besieges Samaria, and after three years takes it, and carries the Israelites away to Assyria, as they did not obey the Lord. In the 14th year of his reign, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, comes up against the fortified cities of Judah and takes them. Hezekiah sends to Sennacherib at Lachish, an important Judean city where he was campaigning, and tries to bargain with him by giving him silver and gold from the temple. Sennacherib sends the Tartan (commander in chief), Rab-saris (field commander), and Rabshakeh (chief of staff) with a great army from Lachish to Hezekiah at Jerusalem. Eliakim (who was over the household), Shebnah (the secretary), and Joah (the recorder, son of Asaph) come out to address them. The Rabshaken says to them in Hebrew that trust in the Lord is like trust in Egypt, futile, and that he will give them 2,000 horses if they can find enough men to ride them. He claims they couldn't defeat even the least of their soldiers. Additionally, he claims that the Lord himself sent Assyria to destroy Judah. Eliakim, Shebnah, and Joah plead with him to speak in Aramaic, lest the people of the city hear their words. Rabshakeh not only denies their request, but addresses the people of the city saying that the king of Assyria is greater than the Lord, and can provide them with abundance, and claims that no god has ever delivered anyone out of the hand of Assyria. The people heed Hezekiah's command to stay silent. Eliakim, Shebnah, and Joah tear their clothes and go to Hezekiah to tell him everything.

## 19. Isaiah Reassures Hezekiah

Hezekiah hears the news and tears his clothes and puts on sackcloth, and goes into the house of the Lord. He sends Eliakim, Shebna, and the senior priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah. They tell Isaiah of the crisis, and ask him to lift up his prayer for Jerusalem. Isaiah tells them to fear not, for the Lord will make the King of Assyria hear a rumor and he shall fall by the sword in his own land. The Rabshakeh returns and finds Sennacherib fighting in Libnah. Sennacherib hears that Tirhakah, king of Cush, has set out to fight against him. Sennacherib sends messengers to Hezekiah once again telling them to forsake the Lord, telling them that no other god before has delivered them from Assyria. Hezekaiah goes to the house of the Lord and prays for deliverance, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that the Lord is God alone. Isaiah sends to Hezekiah saying that God has seen the pride of Assyria, that he will remind Assyria he is sovereign, and says regarding Assyria, "I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will turn you back on the way by which you came." The sign of God's deliverance will be his abundant provision in the land to preserve Judah as they recover from invasion. He says, "For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this…For I will defend this city and save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."  The angel of the Lord strikes down 185,000 Assyrians. Sennacherib returns to Nineveh, and goes to worship in the house of Nisroch, his god. As he is doing so, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer strike him down with the sword and flee to Ararat. Sennacherib's son Esarhaddon reigns in his place.
