## Synopsis

Part 2 of Chronicles (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="divrei-hayamim" text="Divrei hayamim" />*, Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="paraleipomenon" text="Paraleipoménōn" />*), a summary of the Hebrew Bible, setting the stage for the hope of a Messianic King and a new temple.

## 1. Solomon Prays for Wisdom

Solomon becomes King, and God makes him exceedingly great. He and all the assembly of Israel go to Gibeon. The tabernacle and the bronze altar are stationed there, but the ark is in Jerusalem. Solomon offers a thousand burnt offerings at Gibeon. God appears to him in a dream and says, "Ask what I shall give you." Solomon asks for wisdom in leading the people of Israel. God tells him because he did not ask for wealth, honor, the life of his enemies, or a long life, that he shall be blessed with wisdom, and honor and wealth also be his. Solomon gathers together 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and makes silver and gold as common as stone, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore (signifies great wealth). He begins importing chariots and horses from Egypt and Kue, and exporting them to the kings of the Hittites and Syria. Note: the king acquiring many horses is forbidden in the laws of Deuteronomy.

## 2. Preparing to Build the Temple

Solomon makes preparations to build the temple and assigns 70,000 resident alien Canaanite men to bear burdens, 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 to oversee them. He asks Hiram, the king of Tyre who had helped David, for a skilled man to help lead the construction of the temple, and for his servants to join their servants in Lebanon to prepare the cedar, cypress, and algum timber for the temple in exchange for food. Hiram's men were experts in cutting timber. Solmon says, "The house that I am to build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. But who is able to build Him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain Him? Who am I to build a house for Him, except as a place to make offerings before Him?" Hiram responds with a blessing, acknowledging the Lord as the creator of the heaven and earth, and sends him Huram-abi (son of a woman from Dan and man from Tyre—Oholiab who lead the tabernacle construction was also from Dan) to help lead the construction of the temple. Hiram says he will bring the timber by sea to Joppa so it can be taken to Jerusalem.

## 3. Solomon Builds the Temple

In the second month of the fourth year of his reign, Solomon begins to build the temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah (the place where God led Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, and where God accepted David's burnt offerings on the threshing floor of Ornan). The temple is 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet tall. The temple has a large nave lined with gold-covered cypress adorned with precious stones, an inner sanctuary (Most Holy Place) where the ark was kept and guarded by two 15-foot cherubim made of olivewood and separated by a blue, purple, and crimson veil of fine linen, and a vestibule with two pillars adorned with gold chains with pomegranates—one on the south which he called Jachin (*he establishes*) and one on the north which he called Boaz (*in him is strength*). There are many nods to the Garden of Eden, such as the east-facing entrance and the intricate carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and pomegranates, all overlaid with gold.

## 4. The Temple's Furnishings

Solomon makes the bronze altar, the sea (a large metal basin containing 12–18k gallons of water representing the chaos subdued by the Lord, decorated with gourds and supported by twelve metal oxen and its brim like a lily), and the ten basins (5 on the north and 5 on the south). The basins were to wash what was used for burnt offerings, and the sea was for the priests to wash in. He makes 10 golden lampstands (5 on the north side of the inner sanctuary and 5 on the south side), and the court of the priests. The sea is placed in the southeast corner. Hiram (of Tyre, not to be confused with the king) makes the two pillars, pots, shovels, basins, bowls, basin stands, and the stand and oxen for the sea. Huram-abi makes the bronze utensils. Solomon makes the golden altar, the tables of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstands, the golden utensils, and the golden doors.

## 5. The Ark Brought to the Temple

The temple is finished, and Solomon brings in the things that David dedicated to the Lord and stores them in the treasuries. In the seventh month, seven years after the beginning of the temple construction, during the Feast of Booths (Ethanim / Tishri, September / October, fall), the priests take the tabernacle and the ark from the city of David to the temple (north of the city of David). Solomon and the congregation offer sacrifices before the ark before it is brought into the temple. The priests consecrate themselves and bring the ark into the Most Holy Place in the temple under the wings of the cherubim. At this time, the ark only contains the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb (the jar of manna and Aaron's rod are apparently no longer there). The Levitical singers (Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and kinsmen) sing in praise and thanksgiving to the Lord. They sing, "For He is good, for his steadfast love endures forever." When the priests come out of the Holy Place, and the singers sing in praise, the glory of the Lord appears in a cloud and fills the house of God, and it is so powerful the priests cannot stand to minister.

## 6. Solomon Blesses the People

Solomon blesses the Lord before the assembly for fulfilling his promise to David that Solomon would take the throne and build a house for the name of the Lord (his presence cannot be contained, He is transcendent, but the house will be the place of worship for Israel where He will bless and watch over his people and accept their right sacrifices). Solomon stands before the altar raising his hands towards heaven and prays a prayer of dedication before the assembly saying, "Listen to the pleas of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen from heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive." his prayer has seven pleas. The first plea is that when a man sins against his neighbor, God will condemn the guilty and vindicate the righteous. The second plea is that when Israel is defeated by an enemy due to sin, that God will forgive their sin when they repent. The third plea is that when there is drought due to sin, God will forgive their sin when they repent. The fourth plea is that when there is famine or plague due to sin, God will forgive their sin when they repent. The fifth plea is that when a Gentile comes to the house of the Lord for his name's sake, he will be accepted so all the peoples of the earth may know his name. The sixth plea is that when the Lord sends his people into battle, that He will hear their prayers and maintain their cause. The seventh plea is that when the people are exiled due to sin (for there is no one who does not sin), that God will forgive their sin when they repent, remember his chosen people, and deliver them like He did from Egypt. He ends by saying, "Now, O my God, let Your eyes be open and Your ears be attentive to the prayer of this place." The section ends with a version of Psalm 132:8-10 which announces the transfer of the ark into the temple, and calls for God to remember his steadfast love for David.

## 7. The Lord Speaks to Solomon

As soon as Solomon finishes his prayer, fire comes down from heaven and consumes the burnt offerings and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord fills the temple. It is so powerful, the priests cannot enter the temple. The people fall to their faces and say, "For He is good, for his steadfast love endures forever." Solomon and the priests offer sacrifices and dedicate the house of the Lord. Solomon holds the Feast of Booths and sends the people home on the eighth day. They return home full of joy and hope. After Solomon finishes the temple and his house, the Lord appears to him and says, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this pace for myself as a house of sacrifice." The Lord says when He enacts judgment for their sins, that if they repent and humble themselves, He will forgive their sin and heal their land. He also says that if Solomon walks before God as his father did, and follows the Lord's commands, his throne will be established, and the Davidic covenant will be fulfilled. If he turns aside, however, they will be exiled, he will cast the temple out of his sight, and they will serve as an example of a people who turned away from the Lord.

## 8. Solomon's Accomplishments

This section recounts the events that occur within the first twenty years of Solomon's reign. Solomon gives twenty cities to Hiram in Galilee (called the land of Cabul which means fetters), and Hiram apparently gives them back and the Israelits regain control of the area. Solomon takes Hamath-zobah, builds Tadmor, and all the store cities in Hamath (all north of Damascus). He builds Upper and Lower Beth-horon (northwest of Jerusalem), Baalath (in Dan), cities for his chariots and horsemen, and anything he desires to build in the land and in Lebanon. Solomon drafts the descendants of the Canaanites who were not destroyed to forced labor, and the Israelites are made officials, commanders, captains, and horsemen. He has 250 chief officers. Solomon brings his wife (Pharaoh's daughter) from the city of David to the house that he built for her, saying, "My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the Lord has come are holy." Solomon offers burnt offerings to the Lord as the law commanded (daily, Sabbaths, new moons, Passover, Feast of Weeks, Feast of Booths). He appoints the divisions of the priests for their service. Solomon builds a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber (shore of the Red Sea), and Hiram sends him skilled sailors to join his men. They go to Ophir (Arabia) and bring back gold for Solomon.

## 9. Solomon's Wealth and Death

The queen of Sheba (modern Yemen) hears of Solomon's wisdom and comes to see him in Jerusalem. She is left breathless by his wealth and wisdom. She says, "Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel!" She then gives him gold, spices, and precious stones in great quantities. Solomon gives her all that she desires. Solomon's fleet of ships brings almug wood and precious stones from Ophir. Solomon accumulates so much gold that he makes 500 gold shields and puts them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon, and makes an ivory throne with six steps and twelve lions. He makes silver as common as stone and cedar as plentiful as Sycamore (acquiring excessive silver and gold breaks the laws regarding kings in Deuteronomy). His ships go to Tarshish (via the Mediterranean Sea) and bring back more riches. His fame is so great that people come from all over bringing gifts to hear his wisdom. It says, "All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind." He acquires more horses, and even horses from Egypt (breaks the laws regarding kings in Deuteronomy). Solomon's story is written in the history of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat. He reigns for 40 years, and dies and is buried in the city of David. Solomon's son Rehoboam takes the throne.

## 10. The Revolt Against Rehoboam

All Israel goes to Shechem to make Rehoboam king. Jeroboam leaves Egypt and returns with the assembly before Rehoboam. They ask Rehoboam to lighten the hard service and heavy yoke on them (Solomon had put them to forced labor like the days in Egypt). Rehoboam sends the people away for three days so he can meet with his advisers. The elders tell him to lighten the load, but his friends tell him to make the load heavier. He listens to his friends and when Israel returns, he tells them, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions." The Lord hardened Rehoboam's heart to fulfill his plans (much like he did to Pharaoh in Egypt). Israel says they have no portion in David, that each house should return to their own tents, and that the house of David is to look to his own house. Rehoboam sends Hadoram (Adoram), head of forced labor, but Israel stones him to death. Rehoboam flees to Jerusaelm. Israel and Judah remain in rebellion.

## 11. Rehoboam Secures his Kingdom

When Rehoboam arrives at Jerusalem, he gathers Judah and Benjamin to fight against Israel in the north. Shemaiah, man of God, relays God's message that they should not fight their relatives and to return home, so they do. Rehoboam builds fortified cities of defense in Judah and Benjamin (Bethlehem, Tam, Tekoa, Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aijalon, Hebron). Jeroboam casts the priests out of Israel, appoints his own priests, and begins worshiping other gods. The Levitical priests, Levites, and those whose hearts seek the Lord go to Judah where they walk in the way of David and Solomon for three years. Rehoboam takes Mahalath (daughter of Jerimoth, son of David) as a wife and has Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. He then takes Maacah (daughter of Absalom) as a wife and has Abijah (Abijam), Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. He loves Maacah above all his wives. He has 18 wives, 60 concubines, 28 sons, and 60 daughters. He appoints Abijah as chief prince and intends to make him king. He distributes his sons throughout the fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.

## 12. Egypt Plunders Jerusalem

When Rehoboam's rule is strong and established, he abandons the law of the Lord and leads his people into apostasy. In the fifth year of his rule, Shishak, king of Egypt, attacks Jerusalem and takes the fortified cities of Judah and comes as far as Jerusalem. Shemaiah the prophet relays the Lord's message, "You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak." Rehoboam and the princes of Judah humble themselves, and Shemaiah relays the Lord's message that they will not be destroyed, but will be servants to Shishak. Shishak takes away everything including the shields of gold that Solomon had made. Rehoboam makes bronze shields in their place, and his officers use them. When Rehoboam humbles himself, the wrath of the Lord turns from him. He reigns for 17 years in Jerusalem, and he does evil in the sight of the Lord. His story is recorded in the Chronicles of Shemaiah the Prophet, and the Chronicles of Iddo the Seer. He dies and is buried in the city of David, and his son Abijah takes the throne.

## 13. Abijah Reigns in Judah

In the 18th year of Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Abijah begins to reign over Judah. He reigns for 3 years in Jerusalem. There is war between Abijah and Jeroboam. Abijah leads 400,000 soldiers to come up against Jeroboam's 800,000 mighty warriors. He stands on Mount Zemaraim (northern border of Benjamin between the two kingdoms), and condemns Jeroboam for opposing God's grant of perpetual kingship over Israel to the house of David, practicing idolatry, driving out the Levites, and ordaining non-Levite priests to serve false gods. In contrast, he declares that they have stayed true to the Lord's commands, have Levite priests who keep the charge of the Lord, and have not forsaken God. He says, "Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers, for you cannot succeed." Jeroboam's men surround Judah, the priests blow the trumpet, they cry to the Lord, and raise the battle shout. God defeats 500,000 of Jeroboam's men, and they are subdued. Judah takes Bethel and Jeshanah and Ephron (both north of Bethel). The Lord strikes down Jeroboam. Abijah reigns 22 years, has 14 wives, 22 sons, and 16 daughters. His sayings are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

## 14. Asa Reigns in Judah

Abijah dies and is buried in the city of David. Asa, his son, reigns in his place. The land has rest for ten years. Asa does what is good in the eyes of the Lord. He takes down the idols, the Asherim, and the high places in Judah. He commands Judah to seek the Lord. He builds fortified cities in Judah, and the Lord gives him peace. He has an army of 300,000 men from Judah, and 280,000 men from Benjamin. Zerah the Ethiopian comes with a million men to attack Judah in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah (one of Rehoboam's fortified cities on Judah's southwestern border). Asa cries out to the Lord, and the Lord delivers them into their hand. They pursue them as far as Gerar, and they are defeated. They carry away much spoil, and return to Jerusaelm.

## 15. Asa's Religious Reforms

The Spirit of God comes upon Azariah, the son of Oded, and he tells Asa, "The Lord is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you." Asa puts away all the idols from Judah, and repairs the altar in front of the vestibule of the temple. In the 3rd month of his 15th year of reign, he gathers all Judah at the temple, they sacrifice the spoil, and they enter into a covenant to seek the Lord. The Lord gives Judah rest. Asa's mother Maacah built an image for Asherah, and he burns it down at the brook Kidron. He doesn't remove the high places in the former Israelite territory (the reason is not specified). His heart stays true to the Lord, and he brings sacred gifts to the house of the Lord. There is no more war until his 35th year of reign.

## 16. Asa's Last Years

In the 36th year of Asa's reign, Baasha, the king of Israel, goes up against Judah at Ramah, and begins building a fortified city there to cut off Judah from the main road to and from Jerusalem. Without seeking the Lord's counsel, Asa takes all the silver and gold from the temple and gives it to Ben-hadad, the king of Syria who lived in Damascus. They make a covenant, and Ben-hadad conquers Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. Baasha stops building in Ramah, and all Judah takes the stones and timber from there to build Geban and Mizpah. Hanani the seer comes to Asa and tells him that because he did not rely on the Lord like he did with the Ethiopians, that he will have wars. This angers Asa and he throws Hanani in prison, and inflicts cruelties upon the people of Judah. Asa's story is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah. In his 39th year of reign, he becomes diseased in his feet, and again does not seek the counsel of the Lord. He dies in his 41st year of reign, and is buried in the city of David, where they make a very great fire in his honor.

## 17. Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah

Asa's son Jehoshaphat (name means the Lord judges) reigns in his place and strengthens himself against Israel. He places forces in the fortified cities of Judah. The Lord is with him because he walks in the ways of David, and the Lord establishes his kingdom. He gets rid of the Asherim and high places in Judah. In the 3rd year of his reign, he sends officials (Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah), Levites (Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah), and Levitical priests (Elishama and Jehoram) to teach the Law of the Lord in Judah. The surrounding kingdoms are afraid of the Lord and make no war against Jehoshaphat. Some of the Philistines and Arabians even bring him gifts. He builds up the store cities and soldiers. From Judah, 300,000 men led by Adnah, 280,000 men led by Jehohanan, and 200,000 men led by Amasiah. From Benjamin 200,000 men led by Eliada and 180,000 men led by Jehozabad.

## 18a. Jehoshaphat Allies with Ahab

Jehoshapat has great riches and honor and makes a marriage alliance with Ahab. Ahab asks Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, to go and capture Ramoth-gilead from Syria (Syria had captured the important trade route from the Red Sea to Damascus). Jehoshaphat agrees, but first wants to inquire for the Word of the Lord. Ahab gathers together the 400 "prophets", who tell him what he wants to hear, that he will be successful in battle. Jehoshaphat knows something is up, and asks if there is anyone else of whom they may inquire. Ahab says there is the prophet Micaiah, but that he hates him because his prophesies are never good concerning him (or perhaps they are too truthful). Jehoshaphat insists, and Micaiah is summoned. The "prophet" Zedekiah makes iron horns (symbolizing the calf and shows that idolatry was still continuing) to enact Israel winning in battle, and the "prophets" continue to tell Ahab what he wants to hear. Micaiah is summoned, and is told to speak favorably to Ahab, and he does, but Ahab tells him to speak the truth. Micaiah tells Ahab that Israel will be like sheep scattered on the mountains with no shepherd, and the Lord will tell them they have no master and to return home. He says that the Lord sent a spirit to put lying words in the mouths of the "prophets" to draw Ahab out to battle where he would be killed. Zedekiah slaps him and accuses him of lying based on the fact that the Lord couldn't possibly be speaking to them both. Micaiah prophesies that Zedekiah will be forced to hide away in the inner chamber of someone's home. Ahab has his men seize Micaiah, and take him to Amon (governor of Samaria) and Joash (the king's son, responsible for the confinement of prisoners) where he is put in prison with meager rations of bread and water.

## 18b. The Defeat and Death of Ahab

Ahab disguises himself and tells Jehoshaphat to wear his robes, and Israel and Judah go to capture Ramoth-gilead. The king of Syria commands his captains to pursue Ahab. They find Jehoshaphat, but he cries out and they realize it's not Ahab and turn back from him. A soldier shoots an arrow at random, and it hits Ahab in the one place his armor doesn't cover (between the scale armor and the breastplate). He is propped up in his chariot for the rest of the battle, and dies at sunset.

## 19. Jehoshaphat's Reforms

When Jehoshaphat returns to Jerusalem, the prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani, tells him the Lord is angry because he helped the wicked Ahab, but that some good is found in Jehoshaphat because he destroyed the Ahseroth and has set his heart to seek God. Jehoshaphat goes all over Judah teaching the law of the Lord. He appoints judges in the cities of Judah, and tells them they judge not for man, but for the Lord, and charges them to judge with justice, impartiality, and without taking bribes. He appoints certain Levites, priests, and heads of families to judge in the fear of the Lord, in faithfulness, and with their whole heart. Amariah is chief priest, Zebadiah is governor of the house of Judah, and the Levites are officers. Jehoshaphat says, "Deal courageously, and may the Lord be with the upright."

## 20. Jehoshaphat's Prayer

The Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites come up against Judah and arrive at Hazanon-tamar (Engedi, the middle of the Dead Sea's western shore). Jehoshaphat proclaims a fast and assembles all Judah to seek the Lord at the temple. He prays for God's deliverance, protection, and judgment. He says, "We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you." The Spirit of the Lord comes upon Jahaziel (son of Zechariah of the house of Asaph), and he tells the assembly the Lord says not to fear, and that they are to come up by the ascent of Ziz to find them at the end of the valley, east of the wilderness of Jeruel (all locations south of Jerusalem), and that the Lord will be with them, for it is his battle. The assembly bows and worships the Lord. They rise up early and go to the wilderness of Tekoa (south of Jerusalem). Jehoshaphat says to the people, "Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be established; believe his prophets, and you will succeed." He appoints people in holy attire to go before the army singing, "Give thanks to the Lord, for his steadfast love endures forever." Then, Ammon and Moab rise against Seir, and all the enemies destroy each other. Judah takes the spoil, and there is so much they are there for three days. On the fourth day, they gather at the Valley of Beracah (which means blessing). They return home triumphantly, and all the surrounding kingdoms are afraid of the Lord, so they have peace. Jehoshaphat was 35 when he began to reign, and he reigns for 25 years. He does what is right in the sight of the Lord, but the high places are not all removed from Judah. Jehoshaphat joins with Ahaziah, king of Israel, who is a wicked king. They build ships in Ezion-geber (near the Red Sea) to go to Tarshish (modern day Spain?). The prophet Eliezer, son of Doda-vahu of Mareshah in Judah, tells him that because he joined with Ahaziah, the Lord will destroy what he has made. The ships are wrecked and do not go to Tarshish.

## 21. Joram Reigns in Judah

Jehoshaphat dies and is buried in the city of David. His firstborn son Joram reigns in his place. He kills his six brothers (Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah), marries the daughter of Ahab, and leads Judah into idolatry. The Lord remembers his covenant with David, and doesn't destroy his house. It says, "[The Lord] had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever." (a light in dark times, and something to consistently burn like the lamp in the tabernacle and in the temple). Edom and Libnah revolt against the rule of Judah. Elijah prophesies a plague and Joram's death, in which his bowels come out. The Lord stirs up anger against Joram and the Philistines and the Arabians attack Judah and take all Jerhoram's possessions, including his sons and his wives. They spare his youngest son Ahaziah (called Jehoahaz here). Joram then dies of a disease in his bowels, and no fire is made in his honor. No one regrets his loss, and he is buried in the city of David, but not with the kings. He was 32 when he began to reign, and he reigned for 8 years.

## 22. Ahaziah Reigns in Judah

Judah makes Ahaziah, Joram's youngest son, king. He is 22 when he takes the throne, and only reigns one year. His mother is Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri. He walks in the way of Ahab, and his mother and the house of Ahab counsel him to do wickedness in Judah. He goes with Ahab's son, Jehoram to make war against Syria at Ramoth-gilead. Jehoram is wounded in Ramah, and goes to Jezreel to heal. Ahaziah goes to visit him, but God ordains Ahaziah's downfall. The Lord anoints Jehu, son of Nimshi, to destroy the house of Ahab. Jehu destroys the house of Ahaziah. Ahaziah flees to Samaria. Jehu finds him and puts him to death. He receives a burial because he was the grandson of Jehoshaphat. Athaliah kills off the royal family of Judah, but Ahaziah's sister Jehoshabeath (wife of Jehoiada the priest) hides Ahaziah's infant son Joash in the temple for 6 years. Meanwhile, Athaliah reigns over the land.

## 23. Joash Made King

After the 7th year (Joash is 7 years old), the priest Jehoiada rallies the commanders of Judah, and together they gather the Levites of Judah and the heads of fathers' houses, and they all assemble in Jerusalem to make Joash king. Of the priests and Levites who come off duty on the Sabbath, Jehoiada assigns one third to be gatekeepers, one third to be at the king's house, and one third to be at the Gate of the Foundation (a.k.a. gate of Shallecheth, a.k.a the gate Sur, a gate in the wall that surrounded the temple precincts). The people are to be at the temple courts, and only the priests and Levites are to enter the temple under penalty of death. The Levites are to protect Joash. Jehoiada gives the captains spears and shields that were David's from the temple, and all the people are to guard the temple and Joash. They bring out the crown and the testimony and anoint him as king. Athalia hears the rejoicing at the temple, sees Joash, and cries out, "Treason!" Jehoiada has the captains take her to the entrance of the horse gate of the king's house where she is killed. Jehoiada makes a covenant with the people of Judah that they should be the Lord's people. He tears down the house of Baal, destroys the altars and images, and kills Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. He restores the watchmen, gatekeepers, and Levitical priests at the temple. The people of Judah march Joash from the temple to the king's house and set him on the throne. Judah rejoices and has peace.

## 24a. Joash Repairs the Temple / Jehoiada Dies

Joash takes over Judah when he is 7, and reigns for 40 years. While Jehoiada is alive, he does what is right in the eyes of the Lord. He asks the priests to gather money from the people via the tax levied by Moses to restore the temple (which had been neglected and which was pillaged by Athalia). The priests fail to do so, so Joash asks Jehoiada to make a chest in which the funds will be placed. They place it outside the temple and proclaim to all Judah to bring forth the tax levied by Moses. The people rejoice and bring forth their tax and put it into the chest. The box is filled day after day, brought to the treasury, and then given to the workers to restore the temple. After the temple is restored, the rest of the funds are used to make utensils for the temple. They offer regular offerings all the days of Jehoiada. Jehoiada dies when he is 130 years old, and he is buried in the city of David with all the kings because of all the good he had done in Israel. After his death, the princes of Judah give Joash bad counsel and he listens to them and they begin practicing idolatry in Judah. God's wrath comes upon Judah, and God sends prophets to bring them back to the Lord, but Judah doesn't pay attention.

## 24b. Joash's Treachery and Death

The Spirit of God clothes Jehoiada's son Zechariah, and he tells the people, "Thus says God, Why do you break the commandments of the Lord, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the Lord, He has forsaken you." Joash orders the people to stone Zechariah to death in the court of the temple. As Zechariah is dying he says, "May the Lord see and avenge!" At the end of the year, the Syrian army comes to Judah and Jerusalem, kill the princes, and take the spoil to the king of Damascus. The Lord delivers their large army into the hand of the small Syrian army because Judah had forsaken the Lord. Joash is wounded, and his servants Zabad (the Ammonite) and Jehozabad (Moabite) and kill him on his bed to avenge the murder of Zechariah. They bury him in the city of David, but not with the kings. His story is written in the Book of the Kings. Amaziah his son reigns in his place.

## 25. Amaziah Reigns in Judah

Joash's son Amaziah takes the throne in Judah. He is 25 when he begins to reign, and reigns for 29 years in Jerusalem. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord, but not with his whole heart. He kills Jozacar and Jehozabad for killing his father, but does not kill their sons according to the law in which each one is to die for his own sin. He rallies 300,000 soldiers of Judah, and hires 100,000 soldiers from Israel for war. A prophet tells him not to take Israel's men into battle because they do not fear the Lord. He also tells Amaziah not to worry about the money he spent hiring the men because God will provide. He discharges the men, and Israel becomes furious. He defeats the Edomites in the Valley of Salt (south of the Dead Sea), but the Israelite soldiers raid Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon (southwest of Bethel). Amaziah brings the gods of the Edomites back and begins worshiping them. A prophet and royal counselor confronts him, but he threatens the prophet. The prophet prophesies his destruction. He sends messengers to confront Jehoash, and Jehoash responds with a parable of a thistle and a cedar, saying that Judah is overly confident after their recent victory, and that it is best if they stayed home. Amaziah doesn't listen (God hardens his heart because of his idolatry) and they battle at Beth-shamesh, which belonged to Judah. Israel defeats Judah, captures Amaziah, breaks down the wall of Jerusalem, takes all the gold, silver, and vessels from the temple and the king's house, and returns to Samaria. Amaziah lives 15 years after the death of Jehoash. His story is written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah and Israel. The people conspire against him and he flees to Lachish (a heavily-fortified city in Judah), but they find and kill him. He is brought back and buried in the city of David.

## 26. Uzziah Reigns in Judah

Judah makes Amaziah's son Uzziah king over Judah. He is 16 when he begins to reign, and he reigns for 52 years. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord, and sets himself to seek God, and prospers whenever he does. He builds Eloth (Elath, north of the Red Sea). He goes to war with the Philistines and breaks through the wall of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. God helps him against the Philistines, Arabians, and Meunites. The Ammonites pay tribute to him, and his fame spreads as far as the border of Egypt. He builds towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, Valley gate, and the Angle, as well as in the wilderness. He is an enthusiastic promoter of farming throughout the wilderness of Judah (Negeb, the foothills of Shephelah to the west of Jerusalem, and the coastal plain). He strengthens Judah's army, and even makes implements of war to defend the city walls. When he is strong, he grows proud, to his destruction. He goes to burn unauthorized incense to the Lord in the temple, and as the Levitical priests are trying to stop him, the Lord strikes him with leprosy. He remains a leper until the day of his death, and he lives in a separate house. His son Jotham governs the people of the land. His story is written by Isiah the prophet, son of Amoz. He dies and is buried in the field that belonged to the kings instead of in the royal tombs because of his leprosy.

## 27. Jotham Reigns in Judah

Uzziah's son Jotham is 25 years old when he begins to reign in Judah, and he reigns for 16 years in Jerusalem. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord like his father, but he does not enter the temple of the Lord. The people still follow corrupt practices. He builds the upper gate of the temple and does much building on the wall of Ophel. He builds cities in the hill country of Judah, as well as forts and towers. He defeats the Ammonites, and they give him silver, wheat, and barley. He becomes mighty because he orders his ways before the Lord. His story is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. He dies and is buried in the city of David. His son Ahaz reigns in his place.

## 28. Ahaz Reigns in Judah

Jotham's son Ahaz is 20 years old when he begins to reign inJudah, and he reigns for 16 years in Jerusalem. He does what is evil in the sight of the Lord, and walks in the way of Israel. He makes metal images for the Baal, sacrifices as the high places, and even burns his sons as child sacrifices. For this, the Lord gives Judah into the hand of Syria and Israel. Pehak, king of Israel, kills 120,000 men from Judah in one day. Zichri, of Ephraim, kills his son and Azkiram, the commander of his army, and Elkanah, the second in command. Israel takes 200,000 people of Judah captive along with their spoil and goes to Samaria. The prophet Oded rebukes them for subjugating their brothers, and certain chiefs of Ephraim (Azariah, Berechiah, Jehizkiah, and Amasa) stand up to the soldiers who leave the captives. These men give the captives clothes, food, and water, and bring them to Jericho. Ahaz sends a portion from the house of the Lord to the king of Assyria for help when the Edomites and Philistines invade, but Assyria turns against Judah anyway. Then, Ahaz figures because the Syrians were successful, that he too should worship their gods, and he does. It says, however, "But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel." He cuts in pieces the vessels of the temple, and shuts the temple doors. He makes high places in every city in Judah, provoking the anger of the Lord. His story is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. He dies and is buried in Jerusalem, but not with the kings. His son Hezekiah reigns in his place.

## 29. Hezekiah Reigns in Judah

Hezekiah begins to reign when he is 25, and reigns for 29 years in Jerusalem. He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that David had done. In the first year of his reign he reopens and repairs the temple. He assembles the Levitical priests (Kohath: Mahath, Joel; Merari: Kish, Azariah; Gershon: Joah, Eden; Elizaphan: Shimri, Jeuel; Asaph: Zechariah, Mattaniah; Heman: Jehuel, Shimei; Jeduthun: Shemaiah, Uzziel), has them consecrate themselves and carry out the uncleanness from the temple, and makes a covenant with the Lord. After 16 days, the priests finish consecrating the temple. Hezekiah gathers the officials of the city and they bring 7 bulls, 7 rams, 7 lambs, and 7 male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, and a burnt offering is made for all Israel. He stations the musicians in the temple according to the commandment of David, Gad, and Nathan, and they sing and worship during the burnt offering, and they sing the songs of praise from David and Asaph. Hezekiah then calls the people to bring their sacrifices and thank offerings. There are so many offerings that there are not enough priests to flay them, so other Levites assist until more priests are consecrated. There is much rejoicing over how quickly the temple was restored.

## 30. Passover Celebrated

Judah and Israel hadn't been keeping the Passover, and the Levites hadn't cleansed themselves until the second month, so Hezekiah and his assembly decide to keep the passover in the second month as stated in the law (Num. 9:9). They send letters all over Israel and Judah urging the people to return to the house of the Lord to keep the Passover. Hezekiah says, "Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were faithless to the Lord God of their fathers, so that He made them a desolation, as you see…For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to Him." Some of the people laugh and scorn the messengers, but many others humble themselves and come to Jerusalem. It says, "The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the Word of the Lord." Israel and Judah come together, and on the 14th day the Passover lamb is slaughtered. The Levites consecrate themselves and take their posts according to the Law of Moses. There were many people who were unclean who came, so Hezekiah prays, "May the good Lord pardon everyone who sets his heart to seek God, the Lord, the God of his fathers, even though not according to the sanctuary's rules of cleanliness." The Lord hears his prayer and heals the people (heal likely means forgiveness and spiritual cleansing here). The Passover goes so well, it is extended another seven days (reminiscent of the temple dedication in the days of Solomon). There is a great joy in Jerusalem that had not been seen since the time of Solomon (and the first time the two kingdoms came together since Solmon). The priests bless the people, and the Lord hears their prayer in heaven.

## 31. Hezekiah Organizes the Priests

All the people of Israel return to their cities from the Passover and destroy all the pillars, Asherim, and high places. Hezekiah appoints the division of the priests according to the Law of the Lord. Azariah, house of Zadok, is chief priest. Conaniah and his brother Shimei are chief officers, who had ten assistants (Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah). He commands the people of Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites according to the Law of the Lord. People give in such abundance that heaps begin to pile up at the temple. Hezekiah has the priests and the Levites prepare chambers in the temple and bring the contributions there. Kore, the Levite, and his six assistants (Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah) are in charge of distributing the contributions. Contributions are given to male Levites three and older who worked in the temple, and priests twenty and older, along with their families, as they were all faithful in keeping themselves holy. Men are appointed to distribute portions to the sons of Aaron, the priests, in the cities of refuge. It is said that Hezekiah did what was good and right before the Lord his God, and that he followed his commands, seeking God with all his heart, and because of this, he prospered.
