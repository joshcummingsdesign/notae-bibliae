## Synopsis

<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="chavakuk" text="Habakkuk" /> was a prophet who lived during the final decades of southern Judah when injustice and idolatry were rampant. He brings his pain and suffering before God and asks why the righteous are made to suffer with the wicked. God responds explaining that he will judge the injustice in Judah through the nation of Babylon. He asks God why he would use a wicked nation in his judgment. God responds saying that the wicked nation too will be judged, describing the five woes of such nations: wealth, security, power, pleasure, and control. God says this is all part of a larger plan that is to be revealed in time, and that the righteous will live by their faith. Habakkuk responds with a beautiful prayer that remembers and honors God's faithfulness and promises, expressing that he shall remain faithful, even during times of darkness and judgment, because he has faith in God's promise of protection, deliverance, and salvation.
