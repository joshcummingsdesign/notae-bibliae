## Synopsis

<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="yeshayau" text="Isaiah"/> was a prophet from the royal family of David. The Book of Isaiah is his message of judgment to Israel's corrupt leaders whereby their apostasy would lead to Israel's destruction by Assyria and Babylon, followed by his message of hope that God will one day fulfill all of his covenant promises, and that there will one day be a Messianic King from the line of David who will lead Israel's people to covenant faithfulness so that all nations will receive God's blessing and salvation.
