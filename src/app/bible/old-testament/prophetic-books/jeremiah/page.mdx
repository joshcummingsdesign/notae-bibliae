## Synopsis

The prophecy of the prophet <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="yirmya" text="Jeremiah" />, who was an Israelite priest who lived and worked in Jerusalem in the final decades of the kingdom of southern Judah. He warned Israel about the coming judgment from God through Babylon due to their injustice, apostasy, idolatry, and syncretism. He witnesses the exile personally. His scribe Baruch gathers some twenty years of his writing, sermons, and poems. His message is one of judgment and hope, it uproots and tears down, but also plants and builds up. Jeremiah displays an incredible faith in God as he is persecuted, imprisoned, and ultimately taken by Judah into Egypt. He prophesies that after Israel's judgment, Babylon, who represent human pride and rebellion, too will fall. It concludes with the recounting of the Babylonian exile, as well as hope, as the king from the line of David, Jehoiachin, is released from prison and will eats at the royal table for the rest of his days.
