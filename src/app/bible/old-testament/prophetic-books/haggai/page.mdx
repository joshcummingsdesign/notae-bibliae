## Synopsis

<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="chaggai" text="Haggai" /> prophesies to Zerubbabel and Jeshua when the Persian king Darius halts the building of the second temple in Jerusalem. He has them consider that the people have been spending more time on their own houses than the house of the Lord. The people obey the Lord and begin building the temple again, this time blessed by the Lord. He assures them that although the temple is a shadow of the former one, that they are to keep building because the Lord is with them, his Spirit dwells in their midst, and that the glory of this house shall be greater than the former. He has them consider that they have been working with unclean hands, and reminds them this is why they were met with such resistance. He tells them from here on out, their work will be blessed, to have faith, and to turn their hearts and their work to the Lord. Finally, God says he will overthrow kingdoms, and that Zerubbabel, from the house of David, is chosen to be like his signet ring.
