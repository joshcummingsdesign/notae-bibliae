## Synopsis

Little was known about the prophet <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="yoel" text="Joel"/>, but scholars think he was from Jerusalem and wrote this book after the Babylonian exile. He doesn't call out any specific sin of Israel, but prophesies the Day of the Lord, and calls and leads the people in repentance. He describes a plague of locusts that has come upon Judah that devour their food and daily offerings, and calls and leads the people in repentance. He describes darkness, calamity, and the coming of an army, whose arrival may yet be averted by whole-heartedly returning to the Lord. He describes the command to return to the Lord, saying, "Rend your hearts, not your garments," and leads the people in prayer. He describes how upon returning to the Lord, God will have mercy on us, pour his Spirit out on us, and for his glory, save and call upon those who call on him. He will judge the nations, who represent human evil, restore his people and the land, and dwell in their midst forever.
