## Synopsis

<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="yechezkel" text="Ezekiel"/> was a priest from Jerusalem who was among the exiles who were taken as prisoners to Babylon. Five years after the exile, he sees the glory of the Lord as he is sitting by the Chebar canal. God makes Ezekiel mute, and he is only to speak the Word of the Lord, and he is called to prophesy against Israel and the nations and warn them of the fall of Jerusalem. He has a vision of God's presence leaving the temple in Jerusalem due to their idolatry and injustice, but God promises to some day give Israel new hearts filled with his Spirit. Jerusalem falls at the hand of Babylon, and Ezekiel's mouth is opened. God promises to gather his lost sheep from among the nations and place one shepherd from the house of David over them. For his glory, God will forgive them, restore them, and put his Spirit in them. Ezekiel witnesses God raising up and putting his breath into dry bones in the middle of the valley, thereby signifying that he will raise Israel from their graves, put his Spirit in them, and they shall live. He prophesies God's defeat of Gog, who represents human evil, rebellion, violence, sin, and pride. Finally, he has a vision of God's new temple in great detail. God's glory fills the temple, and he sees water flowing out of it into the land, making everything it touches live. The book closes with new laws and land allotments for Israel, and the name of the city is called, "The Lord is There."
