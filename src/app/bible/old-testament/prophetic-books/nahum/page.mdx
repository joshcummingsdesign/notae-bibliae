## Synopsis

The prophet <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="nachum" text="Nahum's" /> poems announcing the downfall of Assyria and its capital city Nineveh, who as a nation represent the violence and oppression of humanity. Nahum prophesies that God won't let violent and oppressive nations endure forever, that violence sows the seeds of its own destruction, that God is grieved by the death of the innocent, and that God's goodness and justice compel him to orchestrate the downfall of oppressive nations.
