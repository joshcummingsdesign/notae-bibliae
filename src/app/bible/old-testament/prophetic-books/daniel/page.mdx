## Synopsis

<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="daniel" text="Daniel" />, who is renamed Belteshazzar, was a member of the royal family of David who was taken to Babylon in the first round of deportations along with <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hananya" text="Hananiah" /> (Shadrach), <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="mishael" text="Mishael" /> (Meshach), and <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="azarya" text="Azariah" /> (Abednego) [the Three Holy Children]. In the face of persecution, God empowers them with a faith so strong it overpowers fire and lions and changes the hearts of two pagan leaders (Nebuchadnezzar and Darius), one fails to read the writing on the wall (Belshazzar). He prophesies God's sovereignty and defeat of four bests which likely represent Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, and the coming of a Messianic King that will rule an everlasting kingdom. He prophesies the defeat of Persia by Alexander the Great, and the rise and fall of Antiochus IV. He realizes Jeremiah's prophecy of 70 years is almost up, so he prays for Israel's salvation, and God answers with a prophecy of "70 weeks" (7 times longer, 490 years) until atonement, the end of sin, and the anointing of a most holy place. He prophesies God's salvation of his chosen people in which they will have everlasting life, while the wicked have everlasting contempt, which underlines the necessity of faith in a fallen world. God will one day defeat the beast and rescue his world.
