## Synopsis

Lamentations (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="eichah" text="Eichah"/>*, Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="threnos" text="Threnoi"/>*) is a book of five poems from an anonymous author—traditionally attributed to Jeremiah—who survived the siege of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile. It encapsulates the spirit of those who live by their faith in the midst of God's righteous judgment against human evil.
