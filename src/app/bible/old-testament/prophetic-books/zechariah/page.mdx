## Synopsis

The prophecies of the priest <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="zecharya" text="Zechariah" /> to the people of Israel who return from 70 years of exile in Babylon to rebuild the temple in the time of the Persian king Darius. He urges the people to not be like their ancestors and repent, and they do. Then, he has a series of 9 dream-visions about the future Messianic Kingdom. Horsemen tell him that the earth is at rest and the angel of the Lord tells him that Jerusalem shall be rebuilt and shall overflow with prosperity. The angel shows him four horns who scatter Israel and four craftsmen come to cast them down. He sees a man with a measuring line, and the angel tells him Jerusalem will be without walls and that God will protect it and dwell in their midst. He sees Jeshua the high priest being put in clean garments, cleansed of iniquity, and told he will keep charge of the temple if he is faithful to the covenant. He sees two olive trees dripping oil into a golden lampstand with 49 wicks which most likely represent Zerubabbel and Jeshua who are charged with finishing the temple and ruling with the Spirit and not by their might. He sees a flying scroll of the curse which devours thieves and liars. He sees a woman in a basket who represents Israel's sin being carried off to Babylon by two women with stork wings. He sees four horsemen who patrol the earth and declare God's Spirit is at rest in the north country. And finally he sees Jeshua the priest being crowned representing the Messianic Priest-King, which will only come to pass if Israel is faithful to the covenant. The book ends with prophetic visions of the future Messianic Kingdom where a Shepherd is sent on a donkey, which the people reject, only to realize he defeats evil among the nations, pours out a spirit of repentance among them, and culminates in living waters flowing out of Jerusalem, all things becoming holy.
