## Synopsis

Some 25 years of writing and poetry from the prophet <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hoshea" text="Hosea"/> who lived in Northern Israel during the reign of Jeroboam II. Hosea marries an adulteress named Gomer, and she and their children represent unfaithful Israel who will ultimately be redeemed. He prophesies that Israel will be destroyed by the Assyrian empire, but that ultimately God's love is more powerful than human sin, and that he will gather Israel and Judah together and appoint one king over them, and they will receive his salvation.
