<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="michah" text="Micah"/> was a prophet from [Moresheth](https://bibleatlas.org/moresheth.htm) (southwest of Jerusalem). The Book of Micah is his message of God's coming judgment on Israel through Assyria and Babylon during the reign of Ahaz in Judah in which he prophesies the future Messianic King born in Bethlehem from the line of David who will rule with peace and justice over the remnant of Israel in Jerusalem to fulfill God's promise to bless all nations.
