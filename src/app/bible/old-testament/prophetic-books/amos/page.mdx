## Synopsis

<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="amos" text="Amos" /> was a herdsman and dresser of sycamore figs who calls out Israel's injustice and hypocrisy during the reign of Jeroboam II. He prophesies the downfall of Israel by the Assyrian empire, and that God will raise up the fragile, torn tent of David and restore the faithful remnant of Israel to bring abundant blessing to all nations.
