## Synopsis

<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="malachi" text="Malachi" /> was a contemporary of Ezra and Nehemiah. He prophesies in a series of six disputes. First, God addresses Israel's concerns that he doesn't love them by showing how he has always preserved and loved the faithful and humble of Jacob, while despising the proud and arrogant of Esau. Second, he address how the people have been bringing lame and sick animals to offer as offerings thereby profaning the name of the Lord. He rebukes the priests for profaning the name of God by misleading the people and breaking his covenant with Levi. Third, he addresses how the people have either been marrying idolatrous wives, or unnecessarily divorcing their Jewish wives thereby breaking the covenant of marriage which exists between the couple and God. Fourth, he addresses the people's concerns that God is not just by telling them he will send a messenger to prepare the way before him who will refine and purify them like fire. Fifth, he addresses how the people have not been tithing according to the Law, thereby abandoning the temple and the priests. God says when they trust him and give freely, he will bless them abundantly. Sixth, he addresses the people's accusations that God lets the wicked prosper and does nothing. God says those who fear him will be written into a book of remembrance and will be his treasured possession. Finally, he says the day of the Lord will be like a burning oven for the wicked, and like a healing sun to the righteous. He ends reminding the people of the Law of Moses, and tells them that he will send a prophet like Elijah to restore the hearts of God's people.
