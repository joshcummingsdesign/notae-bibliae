## Synopsis

<Definition lang="latin" anchor="leviticus" text="Leviticus" /> (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="vayikra" text="Vayikra" />*) explores how is God going to peacefully dwell in the midst of the people and deal with their sin.

## Ritual Sacrifices

* * *

## 1. Laws for Burnt Offerings

While Moses is outside the tabernacle, God speaks to him from inside (Moses couldn't enter the tabernacle at the end of Exodus), and tells him the laws for burnt offerings—the first of the five ritual offerings. A burnt offering is a food offering to the LORD of a male without blemish from the person's herd or flock, which is killed at the entrance of the tabernacle where the priest throws its blood on the sides of the altar. This is an offering that results in the LORD's favor toward the offerer in contexts such as thanksgiving, penitence, vows and self-dedication. This is the most costly offering.

## 2. Laws for Grain Offerings

God tells Moses the laws for grain offerings—the second of the five ritual offerings. It is a food offering to the LORD, part of which is burned on the altar and part of which is kept for the priests, and it is considered to be most holy. The offering is made with fine flower with oil and frankincense or baked unleavened bread with oil. Leaven and honey are prohibited, and the salt of the covenant is required. Salt represents preservation, as in the preservation of their covenant relationship with God.

## 3. Laws for Peace Offerings

God tells Moses the laws for peace offerings—the third of the five ritual offerings. The peace offering is a food offering to the LORD of a male or female without blemish from the person's herd, which is killed at the entrance of the tabernacle where the priest throws its blood on the sides of the altar. It is cooked and the fatty parts go to the LORD as they are the best parts. The peace offering symbolizes a communion meal between the offerer, the priest, and the LORD expressing peace or fellowship and affirming their covenant relationship with God.

## 4. Laws for Sin Offerings

God tells Moses the laws for sin offerings—the fourth of the five ritual offerings. This offering is a sacrifice to the LORD for unintentional sin. The higher the person's status, the more costly their offering and the closer it is to the Most Holy Place. If it's a priest or the whole congregation, they are to offer a bull and seven drops of its blood is sprinkled in front of the veil in the tabernacle. If it's a leader, they are to offer a male goat as a burnt offering at the Bronze Altar. If it's a common person, they are to offer a female goat or lamb as a burnt offering at the Bronze Altar. The sprinkling of the blood implies that the holy objects are considered to be defiled by the sins of the people. There are many parallels here, God sacrificing an animal to clothe Adam and Eve after their sin in the garden of Eden, God providing a ram to sacrifice in the place of Isaac, a lamb being sacrificed in the place of the firstborn during the Passover.

## 5. Laws for Guilt Offerings

The beginning of this section describes sins of omission, sins of commission, and being unclean. In any case, the person is to confess and bring a sin offering so that the priest could make atonement for them. God also commands that if the person cannot afford a female animal from their herd, they can bring two turtledoves or two pigeons, and if they cannot afford that, they can bring fine flour with no oil or frankincense. God then tells Moses the laws for guilt offerings—the fifth and final ritual offering. If a person commits a breach of faith, they are to offer a ram without blemish and make restitution for what they have done. This is also called a "reparation offering" and is for more serious offenses, hence the more costly animal (ram).

## 6-7. The Priests and the Offerings

These sections discuss how the priests are to handle the offerings. The fire for the burnt offerings is to be kept burning continuously, and ashes are to be carried outside the camp while not wearing priestly garments. The memorial portion of a grain offering is to be burned on the altar and the rest is to be eaten by the priests in the court. A grain offering is to be offered by the priests when they are anointed. The priest who offers the sin or guilt offering shall eat it in the court and everything is to be kept clean and free of blood. If the blood of a sin offering goes into the tabernacle, that animal shall not be eaten. Peace offerings should again be kept clean and eaten the day of the sacrifice and the leftovers are to be eaten the next day, but on the third day the rest should be burnt. Not fat or blood is to be eaten, and the best cuts go to the priests.

## Priests Ordained

* * *

## 8. Consecration of Aaron and His Sons

God commands Moses to gather the congregation at the entrance of the tabernacle. This section describes the rite of priestly ordination and is broken up into seven sections (seven symbolizes completion). 1. Moses washes Aaron and his sons and puts the garments on them. 2. Moses anoints and consecrates them. 3. They make a sin offering. 4.  They make a burnt offering. 5. They then sacrifice the ram of ordination where blood is put on the right ear, right thumb, and right big toe to symbolize total dedication and purification. They take pieces of the ram with unleavened bread and make a wave offering. 6. Moses anoints and consecrates their garments. 7. Moses tells Aaron and his sons to eat the ram and bread in front of the tabernacle and to stay in the tabernacle for seven days until the ordination is complete.

## 9. The LORD Accepts Aaron's Offering

This section signifies Moses passing the torch to Aaron. Moses gathers the priests and elders of Israel and has Aaron (as high priest) make a sin offering, burnt offering, a peace offering, and a grain offering before the people as to make atonement for them and so that the LORD may appear to them. Moses and Aaron bless the people and then the glory of the LORD appears as fire which consumes the burnt offering.

## 10. The Death of Nadab and Abihu

Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu light an unauthorized incense offering and are consumed by the fire of the LORD. Later we find out that they may have been drinking and may have tried to enter the Most Holy Place. Mishael and Elzaphan (Aarons cousins) carry them out of the camp. Moses advises Eleazar and Ithamar (Aarons other sons) not to mourn the death of their rebellious brothers because they are ordained. The LORD tells Aaron not to drink in the tabernacle and to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean. Moses tells the priests it is their duty and privilege to partake of the offerings as the LORD commanded. Moses discovers Eleazar and Ithamar burn a sin offering instead of partaking of it and gets angry. Aaron intervenes and says it is too dangerous in light of the events that took place. Moses leans into compassion, shows mercy, and appreciates Aaron's reverence for God's holiness.

## Ritual Purity

* * *

## 11. Clean and Unclean Animals

The LORD declares which animals are clean and unclean to eat and touch. Clean animals consist of the following: whatever parts the hoof and chews the cud (e.g. cows, but not camels); everything in the water that has fins and scales; birds except for eagles, vultures, kites, falcons, ravens, ostriches, nighthawks, sea gulls, hawks, owls, cormorants, storks, herons, hoopoes, and bats; no winged insects except for locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers. The purpose of these laws were not only to express devotion to God, but to help Israel make distinctions about ritual cleanliness and uncleanliness and act as a constant reminder to make such distinctions in the moral realm as well. Unclean does not mean evil. The state of uncleanliness was temporary and lasted until the evening. God states "You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy", which is a call for the people to imitate His character.

## 12. Purification After Childbirth

The LORD commands that a woman who gives birth to a male is unclean for seven days. The boy should then be circumcised on the eighth day, and the woman shall "purify" for 33 days. Women who give birth to a female are unclean for two weeks and must "purify" 66 days. In both cases, after purification she is to make a burnt offering and a sin offering.

## 13. Laws About Leprosy

In this section God gives laws about leprosy (an infectious skin disease of the time, Hebrew tsara'at, not the same as modern leprosy). If a priest diagnoses a mild case, the person is to be quarantined for seven days. If a priest diagnoses a severe case, the person is to show signs of mourning (torn clothes, hair down, mouth covered), cry out "Unclean, unclean," and live outside the camp.

## 14. Laws for Cleansing Lepers

If a leper is healed, the priest is to cleanse the person by bringing two birds, cedarwood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop. He is to then kill one bird over fresh water, and dip the other bird and items in its blood, sprinkle it seven times on the person, and then release the bird. The person is then to live outside their tent for seven days, shave all their hair and wash up on the seventh day, and then make a guilt offering, sin offering, and grain offering on the eighth day. Then the person is deemed clean. This section also anticipates a time when the Israelites will be living in houses in Canaan, and explains the laws for cleansing houses from what is implied to be mold, mildew, fungus, etc. The person is to empty the house and the priest is to inspect it. Unclean houses are to be shut up for seven days after which the affected areas are to be replaced. If the issue persists, the house is to be broken down. The cleansing process is the same, but the blood is to be sprinkled on the house.

## 15. Laws About Bodily Discharges

If a man or a woman has a discharge from their body, no one is to touch them or the area, and they are to clean themselves up, wait seven days, and bring two turtledoves or pigeons to the priest to make a sin offering and a burnt offering. A man who has an emission of semen is unclean until the evening. A woman who is menstruating is unclean until the evening after she is done. God is explicit here saying to "keep the people of Israel separate from their uncleanliness, lest they die in their uncleanliness by defiling the tabernacle that is in their midst."

## 16. The Day of Atonement

After the death of Aaron's sons, the LORD commands that the tenth day of the seventh month shall be the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This is the only day the high priest is to enter the Most Holy Place to make offerings. Aaron is to wear ceremonial garments, and is to light incense before the mercy seat, lest he should see God's glory and die. Aaron is to take a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. He is to take from the people two male goats as a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. After offering his sin offering, Aaron is to take one of the goats and offer it as a sin offering for the people, and confess over the other goat all the sins of the people of Israel and send it off into the wilderness (the scapegoat). No work is to be done on this day, and the people are to fast, as it is a holy day in which all the people of Israel will be cleansed of their sins.

## 17. Laws Against Eating Blood

Bloodguilt will be imputed upon any Israelite who makes a sacrifice outside of the tabernacle. This is to prevent idolatry. The Isrealites are also commanded not to eat the lifeblood of an animal as it is the blood that makes atonement for their sins. A person who eats an animal that has been found dead (not killed) shall be unclean until the evening.

## Moral Purity

* * *

## 18. Unlawful Sexual Relations

God commands that the Israelites not behave like the Egyptians and Canaanites (pagan nations), and commands laws for sexual morality. God prohibits incest, bigamy, pursuing a mensturating woman sexually, offering children to Molech (a pagan god), adultry, homosexuality, and sleeping with animals. God makes it clear that the Canaanites are performing such actions and are therefore being driven out of the land, and that the Isrealites shall set themselves apart by not making themselves unclean before the LORD.

## 19. Love Your Neighbor as Yourself

God calls Israel to act in His image and to be holy (set apart). This includes acting in accordance with the Ten Commandments. God commands that you love your neighbor as yourself: rather than harvesting every last bit of your yields, you shall leave some for the poor and for the sojourner; you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but be just; you shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you shall reason frankly with your neighbor. God commands that the people of Israel not behave like the Canaanites—turning to mediums or necromancers, cutting or tattooing yourself, making your daughter a prostitute—but rather honor elders, show love to sojourners, and be honest and just.

## 20. Punishments / You Shall Be Holy

Those who offer their children to Molech shall be put to death. Those who turn to mediums or necromancers shall be cut off from their people. Those who commit adultry or acts of homosexuality or beastiality shall be put to death. Those who commit incest shall be cut off from thier people and bear their sin. Those who sleep with their brother's wife shall be childless. Mediums and necromancers shall be put to death. God commands that Israel not walk in the customs of the nation He is driving out. God says, "You shall be holy to me, for I the LORD am holy and have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine."

## Qualifications for Priests

* * *

## 21. Holiness and the Priests

Priests are prohibited from coming into contact with the dead except in the case of their closest relatives and are banned from pagan mourning and burial practices. The high priest can't come into contact with the dead at all, even for his closest relatives.  Priests are not to marry prostitutes, defiled women, or divorced women. The high priest must marry a virgin. Daughters of priests who become prostitutes will be burned with fire. No priest who has a blemish or physical defect may approach to offer sacrifices, though they may partake in them.

## 22. Acceptable Offerings

Priests who eat a holy offering while unclean will be cut off from the LORD's presence. Anyone belonging to the house of a priest may eat a holy offering (whether through purchase or by birth). The priests are to guard the holy food. No animal is to be sacrificed if it is blemished. Oxen, goats, and sheep shall remain with their mother seven days after they are born before becoming an acceptable food offering.

## Ritual Feasts

## 24. An Eye for an Eye

God speaks to Moses and tells him the people are to bring pure olive oil so that Aaron can keep the Golden Lampstand burning regularly. Aaron shall arrange twelve loaves of bread (two piles of six loaves) on the Table of the Bread of the Presence with frankincense every Sabbath and eat it in a holy place with his sons. This is the most holy portion of the LORD's food offerings. Whoever blasphemes the Name shall be put to death. Whoever takes a human life will be put to death. Whoever kills someone's animal shall replace it. Whoever injures his neighbor shall have the same done to him, fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.

## 25a. The Sabbath Year & Jubilee Year

God speaks to Moses on Mount Sinai and commands that for six years the people of Israel should sow the land, but in the seventh year they are to let it rest and it will still provide food for them. In the beginning of the 50th year on the Day of Atonement, trumpets are to be sounded to announce the Year of Jubilee (a week of years, seven groups of seven years, 49 years), a year of release and liberty. The land is to rest in this year, and all the people of Israel are to return to their ancestral property. If property is sold (essentially leased since property cannot be sold in perpetuity), it must be priced according to how many years have passed since the jubilee (i.e. the amount of crops that can be harvested). The LORD promises to provide three years worth of crops in the sixth year to feed the people of Israel during the two-year rest for the Sabbath Year and Jubilee Year and the year of sowing the land in the eighth year.

## 25b. Redemption of Property

God commands that land cannot be sold in perpetuity since the land is His and the Israelites are strangers and sojourners to Him. Therefore, if a property is sold (leased), it is then released to the original owner in the year of jubilee. If the original owner wants it back sooner, he must have a family member redeem it, or must pay the buyer back for it. If the property is in a city, he gives up his right of redemption after a year. City houses of the Levites shall always be returned in the year of  jubilee, and farmland of the Levites may not be sold.

## 25c. Kindness for Poor Brothers

If a fellow Israelite becomes poor, you are to take him in as you would a stranger or sojourner and neither profit from him nor make him a slave. You may hire him, but he will go back to his family in the year of jubilee. If an Israelite becomes a slave to a stranger or sojourner, he shall be treated as a worker, and he may be redeemed by a family member or he may bail himself out by paying back the owner based on years of service left. Israelite slaves are to be released in the year of jubilee. God makes it clear these are His servants whom he brought out of Egypt.

## 26. Call to Covenant Faithfulness

God speaks to Moses on Mount Sinai and gives the call to covenant faithfulness. God states that if the people of Israel obey His commands, He will provide food, safety, peace, and abundance for them, make them fruitful and multiply them, keep His covenant with them, and dwell among them. If the people of Israel do not follow his commands, there will be five stages of curses in which He will visit them with panic, disease, war, and privation. If they walk contrary to Him, He will walk contrary to them. If they continue to disobey, he will discipline them sevenfold with death, destruction, disaster, scattering, exile from the promised land, and ultimately making their land desolate. God will attempt to humble them, and if they listen and repent, He will remember his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## 27. Laws About Vows

The Isrealites are all expected to serve God. Since only Levites can serve in the sanctuary, the other tribes are expected to make special vows (donations) to the sanctuary. A person can donate the value of himself or a member of his family (or if he is poor whatever he has). A person can donate an animal. If the animal is unclean, it cannot be sacrificed, but it may be sold by the priests. A person may donate his house, but if he wants it back he has to add a fifth of its value. A person can donate their land, but if they don't redeem it in the year of jubilee, it becomes a holy gift to the LORD. The firstborn man or animal cannot be donated as they already belong to the LORD. Things that are devoted belong to the LORD irreversibly and cannot be ransomed. If someone wants to redeem a tithe, he must add a fifth to it.
