## Synopsis

<Definition lang="greek" anchor="exodus" text="Exodus" /> (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shemot" text="Shemot" />*) is the story of Moses and God's plan to deliver the Israelites from tyranny in Egypt to the promised land where he will dwell in their midst.

## 1. Israel Increases Greatly in Egypt

Israel's descendants multiply greatly in Egypt and begin to fill the land. The new Pharaoh, who didn't know Joseph, feels threatened by them and decides to enslave the Israelites. Pharaoh commands the Hebrew midwives to kill any son that is born. The midwives don't follow his order and Pharaoh commands his people to throw every Hebrew son into the Nile.

## 2. The Birth of Moses

A child is born to a man and woman from the house of Levi. The woman hides him for three months and then puts him in a basket and puts him into the river. The child's sister watches out for him from a distance. Pharaoh's daughter finds the child and takes pity on him. The child's sister insists to her that she take him to one of the Hebrew women to nurse him. When he is older he is brought back to Pharaoh's daughter and he becomes her son, and she names him Moses (translation to draw out) because she drew him out of the water. When he is older, Moses sees a Hebrew man being beaten by an Egyptian, and he kills the Egyptian man. The next day he tries to break up a fight between two Hebrews, but they call him out on his actions. Pharaoh finds out and Moses flees to Midian to escape being killed. Moses helps the daughters of Reuel (aka Jethro the priest of Midian), and is invited into his home and introduced to his daughter, Zipporah, who gives birth to Moses' son Gershom (translation sojourner). Pharaoh dies and the Israelites cry out for help. God hears their cry and remembers his promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## 3. The Burning Bush

While Moses is shepherding Jethro's flock in Horeb (translation the Mountain of God, aka Mount Sinai), God appears to Moses in a burning bush and tells him he sees the Israelites suffering in Egypt and that Moses is to go to Pharaoh and lead his people out of Egypt. Moses asks, "Why me?", and asks what he should say to the Israelites, and God responds by telling Moses his name (I am who I am) so that he may relay the message. God says that he will be with Moses and tells him that he will bring the Israelites out of affliction and into the promised land of Canaan. God adds that the Israelites will plunder the land of Egypt by the simple act of the Israelite woman asking for jewelry and clothing from their neighbor.

## 4. Moses Given Powerful Signs

Moses worries that the Israelites will not believe him, so God gives him three signs to show them so they will believe him (staff turns to serpent, hand in cloak becomes leprous, water from the Nile on dry ground becomes blood). Moses worries he is not eloquent, so God says his brother Aaron will be his mouth and God will be with them. God tells Moses to show Pharaoh the signs, that God will harden Pharaoh's heart, and to tell Pharaoh that God will take his firstborn son if they refuse to let the Israelites go. Moses doesn't circumcise his son and is going to be put to death by God, but he is saved by his wife Zipporah who does the circumcision. Aaron meets Moses in Mount Sinai and Moses shows him the signs. Then Aaron and Moses go to Egypt and show the Israelites the signs and tell them God has seen their affliction, and the people believe and bow their heads and worship God.

## 5. Making Bricks Without Straw

Moses and Aaron ask Pharaoh to let the Isrealites go to worship. Pharaoh says that they are idle and need more work and makes them produce the same number of bricks, but without straw. They must gather their own straw and they are beaten if the same number of bricks isn't produced. The Israelites blame Moses for their suffering. Moses prays and asks why the Lord has done this.

## 6. God Promises Deliverance

God reaffirms his promise to the patriarchs through Moses promising to deliver his people out of Egypt, and unlike with his fathers, tells Moses his name. Moses passes this message on to the Israelites, but they don't listen to him. God then commands Moses to go back to Pharaoh and tell him to let his people go, but Moses worries he is unfit for the job. The section ends with Levi's descendants to Moses and Aaron.

## 7. Plague 1: Water Turned to Blood

God tells Moses and Aaron to tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go and to show him the sign where his staff becomes a serpent, and warns them Pharaoh's heart will still be hardened. They do so, but Pharaoh's heart is still hardened because the magicians of Egypt can perform a similar trick. The Lord sends the first plague in which all the water in the Nile turns to blood. The magicians turn water into blood to contend with God, thereby making matters worse and leading to Pharaoh's heart remaining hardened. (Note, the plagues to follow could be thought of as attacks on the polytheistic Egyptians' false gods, including Pharaoh who many worshiped at the time.)

## 8. Plagues 2–4: Frogs, Gnats, Flies

The Lord brings on three more plagues. First he brings frogs, which the magicians make worse by bringing about more trying to contend with God. Then he brings gnats, and the magicians tell Pharaoh that this is God's work, but Pharaoh doesn't listen. Then he brings flies, but protects the Israelites in Goshen. After Moses prays to the Lord to bring an end to each plague, Pharaoh cheats them out of their freedom and his heart remains hardened.

## 9. Plagues 5–7: Livestock, Boils, Hail

The Lord strikes with three more plagues to get Pharaoh's attention. First all the livestock die, then they are covered with boils and sores (including the magicians who then cannot stand before Pharaoh), and then a severe hail storm striking down everything in the field, man and beast. Again, only the Israelites living in Goshen are protected. Pharaoh finally admits he has sinned and that the Lord is in the right, but as soon as the hail stops, he sins again, doesn't let the people go, and his heart remains hardened.

## 10. Plagues 8–9: Locusts, Darkness

God tells Moses and Aaron to warn Pharaoh that if they don't let the Israelites go, there will be a swarm of locusts that will cover the land. Pharaoh's servants suggest he let them go. Pharaoh is only willing to let the men go and drives them from his presence. The locusts wipe out the land, and Pharaoh again says he has sinned, but again goes back to his old ways and his heart remains hardened. God brings darkness on the land for three days, but provides light in Goshen. Pharaoh is now willing to let the people go, but not the flocks and herds. When Moses says they all need to go, Pharaoh threatens his life and sends him away.

## 11. A Final Plague Threatened

God tells Moses to let the Israelites know they are to ask their neighbors for silver and gold jewelry. It goes over well because of God's promise to Moses. Then Moses warns Pharaoh that if he doesn't let the Israelites go, every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die. Pharaoh's heart remains hardened.

## 12a. The Passover

The tradition of Passover is introduced as a memorial to the events that unfold. God says this shall be the first month of the year. It occurs in the first month of the Hebrew Calendar (March–April in Gregorian Calendar). On the 10th, every house shall take a lamb (just as every Egyptian household will lose their firstborn). On the 14th day each household shall kill their lamb at twilight and put its blood on the two doorposts and lintel of their house (the sign that God shall pass over their home in the tenth plague). That night they shall roast and eat the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs (hysop, which is a traditional herbal medicine) in haste with their clothes on ready to go, leaving nothing of the lamb remaining. For seven days, they are to eat unleavened bread and no leaven shall be found in their homes (this indicates they are sent out of Egypt so quickly that they have to pack up their dough before it is leavened). There shall be a holy assembly on the first day (14th) and seventh day (21st) where no work should be done.

## 12b. Plague 10 / The Exodus

God strikes down all the firstborn of Egypt including Pharaoh's firstborn. Pharaoh finally gives in and lets the Israelites go.

## 12c. The Exodus / Institution of Passover

After 430 years, the Israelites (600,000 men, plus women and children, perhaps 2 million in total) finally flee from Egypt. They leave with silver and gold jewelry and clothing thereby plundering the Egyptians. God tells Moses and Aaron the statutes of Passover. Because there were a "mixed multitude" that went out of Egypt with the Israelites, God requires that all males be circumcised to be identified as part of the Lord's people, and thus eat the Passover.

## 13. Pillars of Cloud and Fire

This section begins by explaining the Feast of Unleavened Bread and the Consecration of the Firstborn as reminders to the people of Israel that God delivered them from Egypt to "a land flowing with milk and honey", and as a reminder to keep him on the forefront of their minds ("a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes"). On their journey to the promised land, God guides them away from the land of the Philistines, where there would most likely be war, and towards the Red Sea. As they are traveling, they see a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night to lead their way.

## 14. Crossing the Red Sea

The Egyptians once again have a change of heart (a hardened one), and they pursue the Israelites. The Israelites once again start doubting Moses saying they would rather serve the Egyptians than die in the wilderness, but he reminds them to have faith in the Lord. Moses leads the Israelites to the Red Sea. God parts the sea and they travel through it with the Egyptians following behind them. The pillar of cloud moves behind the Israelits to create a barrier between them and the Egyptians. The cloud and fire cause a panic and the Egyptians decide to flee, but the sea caves in on them and they are no more. This reaffirms the doubtful Isrealites' faith in the Lord.

## 15. The Song of Moses / Bitter Water Made Sweet

The Isrealites sing the first worship song in scripture about God's deliverance and how he reigns as king. The song describes how God's mission is to confront evil, redeem those who are enslaved to evil, and bring the people to the promised land where his divine presence will dwell among them. Aaron's sister, Miriam the prophetess, sings the refrain. The Israelites arrive in Marah, and they cannot drink the water because it is bitter. They again complain to Moses. The Lord shows Moses a log and he throws it into the water and it becomes sweet. God creates a statute that if they listen to the voice of God, they will be spared from the diseases he put on the Egyptians, for he is their healer. They finally arrive and set up camp at Elim where there is an oasis (12 springs and 70 palm trees).

## 16. Bread from Heaven

The Israelites set out from Elim and arrive in the wilderness of Sin where there is no food. The people again start complaining to Moses. God tells Moses he will provide bread in the morning and meat in the evening, and that the people are to gather one portion every day for 5 days and two portions on the 6th day so they may rest on the 7th (Sabbath / Saturday). God makes it clear this is to test the Israelites. Moses tells his people their grumblings are not with him, but rather with the Lord. God reveals himself in a cloud. Quail (for meat) and manna (a seed much like coriander, but white with a honey-like taste) cover the camp, and the people begin gathering it as the Lord commanded. Some do not listen and gather more than they should and it rots (scarcity mentality, lack of faith). Others do not listen and go out on the 7th day and find none (perhaps lack of willingness to double their work on Friday to follow his dictates and trust his promise). God commands them to keep an omer (unit of measurement) of manna for posterity to remind them what sustained them in the wilderness. They put a jar containing an omer of manna near the testimony (the two tablets of the Ten Commandments), and they eat manna for 40 years until they arrive in Canaan.

## 17. Water from the Rock / Israel Defeats Amalek

The Israelites set out from Sin and arrive in Rephidim, but they cannot find water. They again quarrel with Moses, and ultimately God, but God tells Moses to strike the rock and water will come out of it. God provides water, and the place gets named Massah (testing) and Meribah (quarreling) because they quarreled and tested the Lord. Amalek (a nation of descendants of Esau and enemy of the Israelites) come to fight Israel, and Moses has Joshua (his assistant) choose men to fight with them. When Moses lifts his hands, Israel prevails, but his arms get tired, so Aaron and Hur hold up his hands, and Joshua and the Israelites prevail. God promises to destroy the Amalekites for attacking his people. Moses builds an altar called "The Lord is my banner".

## 18. Jethro's Advice

Moses is reunited with Jethro, Zipporah, and his sons Gershom and Eliezer in Mount Sinai, and Moses tells them all about how God delivered his people out of Egypt. Jethro confesses his faith in the Lord. Jethro sees that Moses is acting as a judge to all the people of Israel. Jethro suggests he appoint righteous men as chiefs by thousands, hundred, fifties, and tens to hear simple cases, but all hard cases would be brought to Moses. Moses does so and Jethro returns home.

## 19. Israel at Mount Sinai

The Israelites settle at the foot of Mount Sinai. Moses goes up the mountain to speak with God, and God tells him that if Israel keeps his covenant, they will be a kingdom of priests and holy nation. The people agree willingly to do all that God commands. God tells Moses to consecrate the people and let them wash their garments in preparation for appearing before him, but not to let them go up the mountain. God appears in thunder, lightning, fire, and a trumpet blast, and calls Moses up the mountain. God tells Moses to bring Aaron up with him.

## 20. The Ten Commandments

God speaks the Ten Commandments to Israel.

01. You shall have no other gods before Me
02. You shall not make for yourself a carved image
03. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain
04. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy
05. Honor your father and your mother
06. You shall not murder
07. You shall not commit adultery
08. You shall not steal
09. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor
10. You shall not covet your neighbor's house

The section ends with laws about altars.

## 21–22. Laws

This section gives specific laws for the time period about the treatment of Hebrew slaves, murder, what to do when a pregnant woman gets hit (eye for eye, tooth for tooth), oxen, bearing false witness, female virgins, idolatry, and compassion towards sojourners, widows, orphans, and the poor. They demonstrate God's desire for Israel to live together in a just and civil society.

## 23. Laws About the Sabbath and Festivals

The pattern of work and rest is also to be applied to the pattern of years. The Feast of Unleavened Bread (celebrating Israel's deliverance from Egypt) is reaffirmed. The Feast of the Harvest (celebrating the firstfruits of labor) and the Feast of Ingathering (celebrating the end-of-year harvest) are introduced. These festivals serve to give thanks and to show trust in God. God will send an angel to guard them on their way to the promised land, and the Israelites are to obey him. God will then slowly drive out the Canaanites until the Israelites possess the land.

## 24. The Covenant Confirmed

The people of Israel again agree to do all that God commands. Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel go to Mount Sinai to worship. Moses builds twelve altars for the twelve tribes of Israel who offer sacrifices of oxen. Moses throws half of the oxen blood on the altar, reads the Book of the Covenant to the people, and throws the other half on them as a sign of the covenant as the people vow to do as the Lord commands. God tells Moses to go up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone. Moses and Joshua go up the mountain and leave Aaron and Hur in charge. God appears in a cloud and in fire and calls Moses. Moses enters the cloud and stays forty days and forty nights.

## 25. Contributions for the Sanctuary

God tells Moses to build a sanctuary (tabernacle), that the people of Israel are to make a contribution through the precious metals and materials brought out of Egypt, and that he will dwell in their midst. This is important because God's presence was lost in the fall in Genesis, but he wants to restore this presence through the family of Abraham and later extend this to all nations. The Ark of the Covenant, Table for the Bread of the Presence, and Golden Lampstand details are revealed to Moses.

## 26. The Tabernacle

The details of building the tabernacle are revealed to Moses. The tabernacle is seen as a tented palace for Israel's divine King. He is enthroned on the Ark of the Covenant (which holds among other things the Ten Commandments and the jar of manna), topped with the mercy seat (lid) with two gold cherubim (between which he will speak to Moses). The Ark of the Covenant will be positioned in the Most Holy Place, which is separated from the Holy Place by a blue, purple, and scarlet curtain with cherubim. The closer things are to the Most Holy Place, the more precious their materials (bronze – silver – gold). There are also many parallels to Eden (east-facing entrance, the Golden Lampstand represents the Tree of Life, the testimony represents Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil), which signify a step toward the restoration of paradise (Eden was where God and man dwelled together in intimacy).

## 27. The Court of the Tabernacle

The details for the Bronze Altar (for burnt offerings) and the Court of the Tabernacle (a movable courtyard) are revealed to Moses. The people of Israel are to bring olive oil for the Golden Lampstand, which Aaron and his sons are to tend to so that it burns regularly.

## 28. The Preists' Garments

God commands that Aaron and his sons will serve the Lord as priests, and describes in great detail the garments that are to be made for them—for glory and for beauty. Aaron's garments indicate that he is to act as a representative on behalf of the 12 tribes before the Lord in order to bring them remembrance. There are also more Eden parallels—linen undergarments are to be worn much like when Adam and Eve had to wear clothes in God's presence after the fall.

## 29. Consecration of the Priests

God commands that Aaron and his sons be consecrated as priests and gives detailed instructions on how to do so. These instructions include the seven-day ordination and consecration ceremony (the anointing oil, sin offering, and two burnt offerings), as well as the regular service of the priests (morning and twilight burnt offerings). The section concludes with the Lord stating he will dwell among the people of Israel and will be their God.

## 30. The Altar of Incense

God commands that the Altar of Incense be built and placed outside of the veil above the ark of the testimony, and that Aaron burn incense on it regularly (morning and twilight when he sets up the lamps), and that Aaron make atonement for it once a year. God also commands that when the census is taken of the people of Israel, each person give half a shekel for the service of the tabernacle to atonement for their lives, lest there be a plague. God commands the Bronze Basin be built and placed in the court of the tabernacle so that Aaron and his sons may wash their feet in preparation for service. The section ends with God's instructions for making the anointing oil and incense. The oil is for consecration, and the incense is for the Holy Place, they are to be treated as holy and not to be used for any other purpose.

## 31. The Tablets of the Testimony

The Lord says he has filled Bezalel (son of Hur of the tribe of Judah) with the Spirit of God to build all he has commanded, and has appointed with him Oholiab (son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan). God commands Israel to remember the Sabbath and elevates its importance to that of circumcision as a sign of his covenant with Israel. The section concludes with God giving Moses the tablets of stone.

## 32. The Golden Calf

Some of the Israelites become impatient while waiting for Moses to come down the mountain and they give their gold to Aaron and he makes a golden calf. The people begin to worship it, which explicitly breaks the second commandment. The Lord tells Moses he will destroy them and make a great nation of him, but Moses intercedes for Israel making the point that he didn't free them from Egypt only to destroy them, and reminding him of the covenant. Moses comes down the mountain and Joshua warns him that war is imminent because the people are beginning to worship false idols as the Egyptians did. In a fit of rage, Moses breaks the tablets and destroys the calf. Aaron makes a lame excuse for making the calf. Moses asks the people, "Who is on the Lord's side?" and the sons of Levi gather around him. Moses orders them to kill the sinners (about 3,000 men). Moses returns the Lord to make atonement, and the Lord tells him to go on and lead the people to Canaan. God sends a plague because of the golden calf.

## 33. The Commandment to Leave Sinai

God commands Moses to leave Sinai and lead Israel to Cannan, and that he will send an angel before them. God says he will not go with them because of their stubbornness. Israel shows remorse for their actions. God says a man shall not see his face and live, so he will cover Moses with his hand until he has passed by, and then he shall see his back. God speaks to Moses in his tent and Moses intercedes for Israel. Moses asks God to go with them to Canaan because it is God's presence that will make them distinct, and that they need God *because* of their stubbornness. God agrees to go with Israel. Moses' face shines because he had been talking with God.

## 34. Moses Makes New Tablets

God commands Moses to make new tablets. The Lord declares his character (merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, forgiving sin, who will by no means clear the guilty). God reaffirms his covenant with Israel. When the people see Moses, his face is shining because he has spoken with God. Moses begins to wear a veil over his face when he is not speaking with God. Moses calls the people for contributions for the tabernacle, they show their penitence for the golden calf by bringing forth their contributions. Moses calls Bezalel and Oholiab to build the tabernacle as the Lord commanded.

## 39. Making the Priestly Garments

This section outlines the making of the priestly garments and ends with the completion of the tabernacle and all the work that God commanded. The people bring the tabernacle to Moses and he blesses them. This parallels God's work in Genesis (God finished his work and saw that it was good and blessed it), and shows the desire to restore what was broken in Eden.

## 40. The Tabernacle is Erected

Moses erects the tabernacle and Aaron and his sons are anointed as priests. Oil (symbol of the Holy Spirit) is used to symbolically dedicate the items in the tabernacle (built with materials owned by the Egyptians, plundered by the Isrealites, and nearly becoming a golden calf) to God, and establish its purpose in serving him. The cloud covers the tabernacle and Moses is unable to enter. The glory of the Lord fills the tabernacle and the Lord dwells in the midst of Israel. The people do not set out until the cloud covers the tabernacle. The cloud and fire are present throughout their journey signifying that God is with Israel.
