<Initial text="Genesis" />

<Definition lang="greek" anchor="genesis" text="Genesis" /> (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="bereshit" text="Bereshit" />*) is the first book of the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="pentateukhos" text="Pentateuch" />—the first five books of the Hebrew Scriptures written by [Moses](/people/genealogies/biblical?id=184), also called the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="torah" text="Law" />. It is about the creation of the world, the fall of man, and God's plan to redeem all nations through Abraham.

## God & The World

---

## 1. The Six Days of Creation

In six days, God creates the heavens and the earth and all living things. He creates man in his image, blesses him, and gives him dominion over the earth to subdue it.

### 1:1–2. In the Beginning

<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="elohim" text="God" />—who is the Principle without a principle—creates the heavens and the earth *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="ex-nihilo" text="ex nihilo" />*. The <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="ruach" text="Spirit of God" /> hovers over the waters of the void, ready to bring forth order, and life, and beauty.

### 1:3–5. The First Day: Let There Be Light

God says, "Let there be light." God's word is so powerful that he speaks and it is so. God's light shines through the darkness, and the darkness cannot overpower it; the shadow cannot overcome it. Thus, we have day and night, and God sees that the light is good. And there is evening and morning, the first day. The evening comes first as God is ordering time, to signify the starting of a new day.

### 1:6–8. The Second Day: The Heavens

God, through his all-powerful word, separates the waters and creates an expanse in the universe—the heavens. And there is evening and morning, the second day.

### 1:9–13. The Third Day: The Earth and Seas

God, by his word, creates the earth and the seas, and brings forth vegetation upon the land. God sees that it is good. And there is evening and morning, the third day.

### 1:14–19. The Fourth Day: The Sun, Moon, and Stars

God decrees there be lights in the heavens—the sun, moon, and stars—to rule over the day and the night, thereby ordering time. God sees that it is good. And there is evening and morning, the fourth day.

### 1:20–23. The Fifth Day: Animals of the Air and Seas

God, by his word, brings forth animals of the air and seas. God sees that it is good, and <Definition lang="english" anchor="bless" text="blesses" /> them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply." And there is evening and morning, the fifth day.

### 1:24–31. The Sixth Day: Animals of the Land, and Man

God, by his word, brings forth the animals of the land, and God sees that it is good.

Then God says, "Let us make man (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="adam" text="Adam" />*) in our image." Already we see that like God—who is both the Most High and the Spirit hovering over the face of the waters—there is in us a oneness of persons, and a sacred dignity. And inside we long for the Creator, whose image we bear.

And if it weren't enough to give us life when he needn't not, he gave us a sacred dominion, so that we may be good stewards of the creation in which he so graciously placed us. But how will this dominion be carried out? What kind of stewards will we be?

Then he blesses Adam, says, "Be fruitful and multiply," and charges him to subdue the earth, to help maintain the order God so wisely established upon it.

Now with everything on earth so graciously provided for the flourishing of all living things, God sees that it is *very* good. And there is evening and morning, the sixth day.

## 2. God Rests, The Creation of Man and Woman

On the seventh day, God rests from his work creating all things visible and invisible. The creation of man and woman is recounted in more detail. Adam is formed from the dust of the ground. God puts Adam in the garden of Eden to work and keep it. God commands Adam not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Woman is made from man's rib, and the two are to become one flesh in marriage. Man and woman are naked and not ashamed.

### 2:1–3. The Seventh Day: God Rests

God has created all the things visible and invisible, including the <Definition lang="english" anchor="angel" text="angels" /> and the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="keruvim" text="cherubim" /> (Isa. 37:16) and <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="seraphim" text="seraphim" /> (Isa. 6:2), spiritual beings who stand beside God's heavenly throne. Therefore it says, "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="sabaoth" text="host" /> of them." On the seventh day God <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shabbat" text="rests" /> from all his work, and thereby blesses or sanctifies the seventh day as a day of rest. Thus the pattern of work and rest is established.

### 2:4–7. The Creation of Man

Moses now goes back to describe in more detail the account of the sixth day when God created Adam. The Lord forms Adam from the dust of the ground, and breaths into him the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="neshama" text="breath of life" />. God's presence and breath are life-giving. Without him we are naught.

### 2:8–17. The Garden of Eden

The Lord plants a garden in [Eden](/places/old-testament/genesis/eden), and puts Adam there to work and keep it. God has provided everything for the flourishing of life. Moses calls attention to two trees in the garden of Eden: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Here God gives his first command to Adam, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die." Will we turn to God—who is Truth—for all truth? Or will we try to define truth for ourselves apart from God? Life apart from God—who is Life—is death. Will we eat from the tree of life? What kind of stewards of the garden will we be?

### 2:18–23. The Creation of Woman

God said it is not good for man to be alone. The Lord brings all the animals to Adam for him to name, but there is no helper fit for him. So the Lord causes a sleep to fall upon Adam, and the Lord takes one of his ribs to make woman. Adam says, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh." And she is called woman.

### 2:24–25. One Flesh, Naked and Not Ashamed

"Therefore," it says, "a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." Then it goes on to say, "And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."

So here we see man and woman created perfectly in God's image. One flesh. Nothing to hide. Nothing to fear. Living in the presence of God, who is eternal life. All is provided. There is <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shalom" text="shalom" />—completeness, wholeness, peace, and rest.

## 3. The Fall

The ancient serpent, that is the devil (Rev. 12:9), deceives the woman, and Adam and the woman eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Adam and the woman hide themselves, but God, knowing all things, confronts them, and gives them divine consequences, but not without promising the coming of a future redeemer. The man calls his wife <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="khava" text="Eve" />, as she is the mother of all living. An animal is sacrificed to clothe Adam and Eve, to cover their sin and nakedness. Man and woman, created perfectly in the image of God, have now fallen into a state of sin, and are therefore removed from the presence of God, who is eternal life.

### 3:1. The Serpent

The serpent—that is the devil (Rev. 12:9)—is said to be more crafty than the other creatures God had made. Interestingly the Hebrew word <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="seraphim" text='"seraphim"' /> gives the image of a fiery serpent. One can see from this passage that the devil had fallen before man.

### 3:2–5. The Serpent and the Woman

The serpent says to the woman, "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?" which is not true, God said not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. How easily God's word can be twisted. She replies saying they were commanded not to touch the tree lest they die, but the serpent tells her, "You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." The great irony being that man and woman are already created in the image of God and were given dominion. See how crafty is the devil? Confusing and tempting us; wanting us to turn away from our Creator and define truth for ourselves.

### 3:6–8. The Man and Woman Eat of the Tree

The tempting nature of <Definition lang="english" anchor="sin" text="sin" /> and <Definition lang="english" anchor="concupiscence" text="concupiscence" /> is then explained by Moses so simply and so accurately, "The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise." How tragic it is that we have inherited the sinful nature of our first parents. She eats of the tree and gives some to Adam. Then they realize they are naked, and cover themselves and hide from God's presence when they hear him walking in the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="ruach" text="cool of the day" />. How foolish we are that when we sin, we hide and cover ourselves instead of turning to God who already knows our inward being and secret heart (Ps. 51:6).

### 3:9–13. The Lord Confronts Adam

God, already knowing what Adam had done, calls to him, "Where are you?" Adam replies, "I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself." Notice how Adam turns to fear, shame, and hiding, instead of turning to God. Then he blames the woman, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate." And she blames the serpent, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate." And thus we have the sin and brokenness of the human condition, which entered into God's good creation through our first parents.

### 3:14–15. The Prophecy of the Redeemer

The Lord says to the serpent, "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel." In these words are the hope of humanity. Despite human sin, and the temptations of the devil, the Lord tells us that through the woman shall come a <Definition lang="english" anchor="redeemer" text="redeemer" /> who shall overcome the ancient serpent (Rev. 12:9); but this <Definition lang="english" anchor="redemption" text="redemption" /> will not come without suffering.

### 3:16–20. The Fall

God gave humanity dominion over his good creation. What a tremendous responsibility our first parents had to be good stewards of this incredible gift; and how disastrous it was that they misused this dominion, thereby changing the very nature of their posterity from perfection to sin and error. This is what we call "the fall".

The Lord says to the woman, "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children." Here we get the first mention of the woman bearing children, and because of our fallen nature, it will not be without pain.

The Lord then says to the woman, "Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you." The Hebrew which is rendered as "for your husband" carries the connotation of "for" but also "against" or "contrary to". Adam was given the responsibility to love and protect his wife, but he instead fell into sin and error along with his wife. As a result, not only is the relationship between God and man tarnished, but also the relationship between man and woman. Here the Lord explains the ongoing struggle the man and woman will now face after the fall. The woman's role as loving servant is marred by a desire which is contrary to her husband, and the man's role as unifying protector is marred by a desire for domineering rule.

Then the Lord says to Adam, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree...cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life...By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return." And herein lies the tragedy of man. He who once had abundance beyond measure, which God ever so graciously provided, now only eats by the sweat of his brow. Further, we see that now man shall someday die. God, not wanting that man should live forever in a state of sin and suffering, has numbered his days. Life apart from God—who is Life—is death.

### 3:20–24. Adam & Eve Driven Out of Eden

Before, Adam had called is wife "woman", but now that we have mention of her bearing children, Adam calls her <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="khava" text="Eve" />, as she is the mother of all living. Then, because Adam and Eve have realized their nakedness, the Lord makes garments of skins and clothes them; the first instance of animal sacrifice to cover sin. The Lord then says, "Behold, man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and life forever—" the sentence being cut short, implying that it is not good for man to live forever in this sinful state. God then drives Adam and Eve out of the garden of Eden, to the east. The Lord then guards with tree of life with cherubim and a flaming sword; the image being the Lord brandishing a flaming sword between the cherubim.

## 4. Cain & Abel

### 4:1-5. The Lord Accepts Abel's Offering

Adam and Eve have a son named <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="kayin" text="Cain" />, and Eve says, "I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord," and then they have another son named <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hevel" text="Abel" />. Cain worked the ground, and Abel was a shepherd. In the course of time, Cain brought an <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="minkha" text="offering" /> to the Lord of the fruit of the ground, and Abel brought an <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="minkha" text="offering" /> of the firstborn of his flock (offering in gratitude to the Lord the first and best of his sustenance before taking his portion), and gave the Lord the choicest parts, the fat portions. The Lord accepts Abel's offering, likely by a visible sign such as fire, which makes Cain very jealous.

These offerings were made willingly and freely without any law or ordinance. The name "Abel" sounds like the Hebrew for "breath", and later when the Lord accepts an offering, he is said to "smell a sweet savour" (Gen. 8:21). The steadfast love and faithfulness which is born in the heart of the one drawing near to the Lord is the "sweet savour".

### 4:6-7. Sin Is Crouching at the Door

The Lord confronts Cain's jealousy, saying, "Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, and you must rule over it." The Hebrew for "do well" in this case means to do what is right and pleasing in the sight of the Lord. The Hebrew which is rendered as "its desire is for you" carries the connotation of "for" but also "against" or "contrary to". In other words, sin wants to rule over us, but we must subdue it. This is only possible with the help of the Lord, who here tells Cain that by doing so he would be accepted just as his brother was.

## 5. Adam's Descendants to Noah

Adam's descendants to Noah (sounds like the Hebrew word for "rest")

## 6. Corruption on Earth / Noah and the Flood

The "sons of God" begin to multiply on earth with human wives spawning Nephilim (translation: fallen ones), who are mighty men. God numbers man's days at 120 years. Man begins to spread wickedness and God regrets making man and decides to flood the earth. He decides to save righteous Noah and tells him to build an ark and establishes a covenant with him. Noah does all that God commanded him.

## 7. Noah and the Flood

God tells Noah that in seven days it will rain for forty days and forty nights. Noah takes his family into the ark. The floods blot out all living things and the waters prevail for 150 days.

## 8. The Flood Subsides / God's Covenant with Noah

The flood subsides. God tells Noah that man and all living things should go forth and multiply. Noah builds an altar to the Lord and offers burnt offerings. God says never again shall he flood the earth.

## 9. God's Covenant with Noah / Noah's Fall

God tells Noah to multiply and fill the earth and says that flesh shall not be eaten with its blood and that blood shall be shed for whoever sheds the blood of man. God establishes his covenant with Noah that never again shall he flood the earth. The rainbow shall be a sign of this covenant. Noah plants a vineyard and gets drunk. Ham shames his father and Noah curses his son Canaan and gives Shem pride of place.

## 10. Nations Descended from Noah

Nations descended from Noah's sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, each with their own languages.

## 11. The Tower of Babel

People migrate from the east and speak one language, the antithesis of what God commanded. They are proud of their new technology (the brick) and they build a tower out of arrogance. God sees the tower, confuses their language, and scatters them. City is called Babel because of this. Babel = Babylon, symobilizes humanity's ambition to dethrone God and make the earth its own. The chapter ends with Shem's descendants to Abram (translation: exalted father).

## 12. The Call of Abram

God calls Abram to travel to a land that will become his so that God may make him a great nation and bless him and make his name great so that all the families of the earth shall be blessed. He travels with his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot from Haran to Canaan near the oak of Moreh where God promises his offspring the land. Abram builds an altar there and then settles between Bethel and Ai where he builds another altar. There is a great famine in Canaan, so he travels to Egypt, but he is worried he will be killed when they see his beautiful wife Sarai, so he tells her to pretend she is his sister. Pharaoh takes her into his harem of wives and God brings a plague to him. Pharaoh sends Abram and Sarai away.

## 13. Abram & Lot Separate

Abram goes to Negeb and becomes rich. He then goes back to the place between Bethel and Ai and there is not enough land to support both him and Lot. Lot sees the Jourdan Valley is the most fruitful like the Lord's garden, so he settles in Sodom which ends up being full of wicked people. Abram moves to Canaan. God tells Abram that all the land he can see will belong to his offspring (of which there will be many). Abram moves to Hebron and builds an altar.

## 14. Abram Rescues Lot

Lot is taken captive by an alliance of four kings who invade Sodom and Gomorrah and defeat a local confederation of five kings. Abram gets word of this and leads a small force of 318 men into the Jourdan Valley to recover all the people and possessions including his nephew Lot. Melchizedek (translates to "King of Righteousness"), the king of Salem (translates to *peace*, it is the ancient name of Jerusalem which means *possession of peace*) and also a priest, brings out wine and bread and blesses Abram. Abram gives Melchizedek a tenth of everything. The king of Sodom offers him riches, but Abram rejects, affirming that he is depending on God, not human kings or their gifts to become a great nation.

## 15. God's Covenant with Abram

Abram sees God in a vision and expresses his worry about not having any children. God tells him to count the stars in the sky, and that's how many offspring he will have. Abram trusts in God, and his faith is counted as righteousness. Abram asks God how he will know he and his descendants will possess the land of Canaan. Got tells him to bring a heifer, goat, ram, turtledove, and pigeon (all three years old). He cuts them all in half (except for the birds). In a dream, God says that his descendants will travel to a land and be servants there for 400 years, but he will bring judgement and they will come out with great possessions and return to Canaan. When he wakes up, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch pass between the animal pieces (in this ritual a servant would typically walk through the king's pieces to signify he would be cut up like the pieces if he breaks the covenant, but here the fire represents God passing between the pieces himself). God makes a covenant with Abram that the land will belong to his offspring.

## 16. Sarai and Hagar

Sarai cannot have children so she tells Abram that her servant Hagar will be their surrogate. Hagar gets pregnant and begins showing contempt for Sarai because she cannot bear children. Sarai deals with her harshly and Hagar runs away. The angel of the Lord finds her near a well and tells her to submit to Sarai and that her son's name will be Ishmael (translation "God Hears") and that he will be stubborn and live a life of hostility. She is awestruck that God sees her and the well is named Beer-lahai-roi (translation "well of the Living One who sees me"). Ishmael is born.

## 17. Abraham and the Covenant of Circumcision

God appears to Abram and makes a covenant that he shall be the father of many nations and tells him that his name shall be Abraham (translation: father of a multitude). Circumcision will be the sign of the covenant (eight days of age). God tells Abraham that his wife Sarai is now to be called Sarah, and that she will bear him a son named Isaac. Although God gives Isaac pride of place, he blesses Ishmael and says he will become a great nation. Abraham then circumcises all the men of his house.

## 18. Abraham Intercedes for Sodom

Three men show up at Abraham's tent and he recognizes that one of the visitors is a divine manifestation. He shows great hospitality to the men and the Lord says that he will return next year and although she is very old, Sarah will have a son. The Lord looks to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because wickedness is very bad there. Abraham, knowing Lot is in Sodom, intercedes asking God to do what is just by not sweeping away the innocent with the wicked. God agrees that if there are ten righteous people found in Sodom, he will not destroy it.

## 19. God Rescues Lot

The two angels go to visit Lot in Sodom and he shows them hospitality. The men of the city go to rape the two "men", but in a dispicable act of desperation, Lot offers his two daughters. This angers the men and they go to attack him, but the two "men" strike them blind. The angels tell Lot to flee to the hills because Sodom will be destroyed for its wickedness. Lot tries to tell his sons-in-law, but they think he is joking. Lot lingers there, so the angels pull him, his wife, and his two daughters out of Sodom. He settles in Zoar. God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah with sulfur and fire. Lot's wife doesn't heed the angels' warning, looks back, and is turned to a pillar of salt. Abraham sees the smoke in the valley. Lot moves into the hills and his two daughters are so worried that they will never conceive that they get him drunk and bear his children who become the Moabites and the Ammonites.

## 20. Abraham and Abimelech

Abraham doesn't learn his lesson and once again tells someone Sarah is his sister for his own self-protection. This time it's with the king of Gerar, Abimelech. Abimelech takes Sarah into his harem of wives and God visits him in a dream to warn him of the consequences of sleeping with Sarah because she is the wife of a prophet (Abraham). Abimilech proclaims his innocence and confronts Abraham. Abraham mischaracterizes the people of Gerar as not being God-fearing. Abimelech shows generosity by giving Abraham riches. Abraham prays and God vindicates Abimelech.

## 21. The Birth of Isaac

Isaac is born. Abraham makes a feast on the day Isaac is weaned and Ishmael begins to mock. Sarah gets angry, says that Ishmael will not be an heir with Isaac, and casts him and Hagar away. God tells Abraham not to worry because he will make Ishmeal a great nation. Hagar and Ishmael wander through the desert and she believes Ishmael will die of thirst. The angel of God visits Hagar and shows her to a well. Ishmael grows up to be a great hunter. Abimelech seizes a well from Abraham. Abraham and Abimelech make a treaty and Abraham gives Abimelech seven ewe lambs to secure ownership of the well (Beersheba).

## 22. The Sacrifice of Isaac

God tells Abraham to sacrifice Isaac in the land of Moriah in the mountains. As he is about to do it, God stops him and provides a ram instead. Abraham calls the place "The Lord will provide", and it is said, "On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided." God reaffirms his commitment to Abraham that in his offspring all nations of the earth shall be blessed.

## 23. Sarah's Death and Burial

Sarah dies and Abraham negotiates a burial spot for her in Canaan in the cave of Machpelah (east of Hebron), the land that God promised him.

## 24. Isaac and Rebekah

Abraham, concerned that there are no Godly men in Canaan, has a servant go out to the land of his father (Nahor) to find Isaac a wife. The servant goes to Nahor and God guides him to Rebeka, a member of Abraham's clan. Rebekah agrees to marry Isaac and the family gives their blessing. She travels with the servant back to Canaan where she meets Isaac and marries him. He falls in love with her and is comforted after his mother's death.

## 25. Abraham's Death & His Descendants

Abraham remarries to Keturah and has six children. Abraham gives all that he has to Isaac. Abraham dies and is buried with his wife Sarah in Canaan. Isaac and Rebekah have twins, Esau (hunter, loved by father) and Jacob (name means "he who takes by the heel" or "supplanter", quiet, loved by mother), and God says that the older shall serve the younger. Jacob convinces Esau to sell him his birthright when Esau is hungry and Jacob has stew.

## 26. God's Promise to Isaac

There is a famine and Isaac goes to Gerar. God reaffirms his promise to Isaac. Isaac lies and says Rebekah is his sister, the same way his father did. Abimelech rebukes Isaac and protects him and Rebekah. Isaac becomes very rich. Abimelech sends him away. He ends up in Beersheba where the Lord blesses him and he builds an altar. He makes a treaty with Abimelech. Isaac's son Esau takes two wives and makes life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.

## 27. Isaac Blesses Jacob

Isaac is old and is unable to see. He tells Esau to go and bring him some food so he may bless him. Rebekah tells Jacob to bring the food while Esau is out hunting. Jacob brings Isaac the food and he is blessed instead. Esau comes back and is very angry and wishes to kill Jacob. Rebekah tells Jacob to flee to Laban, her brother in Haran (Paddam-aran), until Esau calms down.

## 28. Jacob Sent to Laban / Jacob's Dream

To avoid having Jacob marry a Canaanite, Isaac sends him to Laban to marry one of their clan. Esau takes a third wife, the daughter of Ishmael. Between Beersheba and Haran, Jacob has a dream that there is a ladder leading from earth to heaven where angels are descending, and God stands beside him and reaffirms his promise to Abraham (symbolizing that man's desire is to climb the ladder like in the Tower of Babel, when God is really interested in climbing down and dwelling among his people). He is so moved that he builds a pillar (not an altar, implying he is not yet committed to the Lord) and calls the place Bethel (the house of God). Jacob (still ambivalent regarding his commitment to the Lord) vows to worship God and give him one tenth of everything (later becomes known as a tithe, or one tenth of a worshiper's income) he is given if God is with him on his journey.

## 29. Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel

Jacob falls in love with Rachel, Laban's daughter, and agrees to work for Laban for seven years for her hand in marriage. On their wedding night, Laban sends his eldest daughter Leah to sleep with him instead. In the morning, Jacob is confused and Laban says it is not customary for the younger to be given before the firstborn. He agrees to work another seven years for Rachel's hand in marriage and they are married. He loves Rachel more than Leah. Leah ends up having four sons and Rachel has none.

## 30. Jacob's Children & Prosperity

Rachel cannot have children and has her servant Bilhah be the surrogate to two sons. Leah cannot have children so she has her servant Zilpah be the surrogate to two sons. Leah ends up having two more sons and a daughter. Rachel ends up having a son Joseph. Jacob has made Laban very wealthy and Jacob asks him to let him go so he can return home with his family. Laban agrees to pay Jacob with his speckled and spotted sheep, but Laban secretly removes them from his flock and gives them to his sons instead. Over the course of six years, Jacob begins selectively breeding speckled and spotted sheep from the strongest of the bunch to be his sheep, and leaves the weaker ones for Laban. Jacob becomes very wealthy.

## 31. Jacob Flees from Laban

Tension is growing between Laban and Jacob, so he decides to take his family and all his possessions and return to Canaan. While Laban is shearing his sheep, Rachel steals her father's "gods" and they leave to Gilead. Laban finds out and goes to follow them, but God warns him not to say anything to Jacob. Laban confronts Jacob anyway. He looks for his "gods", but Rachel hides them. Jacob tries to reason with him saying he has given him twenty years of work. Jacob sets up a pillar with a single stone called Mizpah (watchpost) and Laban and his kinsmen make a heap of stones called Galeed (heap of witness) to be a witness between them. They make a covenant and Laban returns home.

## 32. Jacob Wrestles with God

Jacob gets word that his brother Esau is coming to see him and is bringing 400 men with him. He is very scared so he divides into two camps, says a prayer (the first time he addresses God as O Lord) that he is unworthy of God's steadfast love and faithfulness, and ask for God to deliver him from the hand of his brother. He sends his servants ahead of him with animal gifts to try and appease him before they meet. That night, he sends his wife and servants across the Jabbok river. When he is alone, Jacob wrestles with a "man" and wins. The "man" touches Jacob's hip socket and puts it out of joint. Jacob won't let the "man" go unless he blesses him. The "man" says his name is no longer Jacob, but is Israel because he has striven with God and has prevailed. He calls the place Peniel (translation: the face of God).

## 33. Jacob Meets Esau

Jacob meets Esau and Esau runs to meet him and embraces him. Jacob offers him the animal gift and Esau graciously declines. Jacob insists. Esau invites Jacob to return to Seir with him, but Jacob uses travel-weariness as an excuse to head off to Succoth and then off to Shechem in Canaan. Jacob buys Shechem (the land) from Hamor, the father of Shechem (the person), for a hundred pieces of money and builds an altar there and calls it El-Elohe-Israel (God, the God of Israel).

## 34. The Defiling of Dinah

Jacob's daughter Dinah is raped by Shechem and her brothers are furious. Shechem begs for her hand in marriage, but the brothers say only if every male in his clan is circumcised. All the men get circumcised and when they are sore, Dina's brothers Simeon and Levi kill and rob them and take their sister out of Shechem's house. Jacob tells his sons they have brought trouble on him.

## 35. God Blesses and Renames Jacob

God tells Jacob to go to Bethel, so he has his family put away their "foreign gods" and travel with him there to build an altar to God. God protects them on their journey and the altar is built.

## 40. Joseph Interprets Two Prisoners' Dreams

Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker get put in prison. They each have dreams and tell them to Jacob. Jacob tells the cupbearer his dream means he will be released in three days, and to remember him and tell Pharaoh his story. He tells the baker that he will be hanged in three days. Jacob is right and the events play out, but the cupbearer doesn't remember him.

## 41. Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams

Pharaoh has two dreams that he wishes to be interpreted. The cupbearer remembers Joseph and he is brought before Pharaoh to interpret the dreams. He tells Pharaoh that the dreams mean there will be seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. He suggests storing food for the famine.

## 42. Joseph's Brothers Go to Egypt

All of Joseph's brothers except Benjamin go to Egypt to buy grain not knowing that the second in command is Joseph. He recognizes them, but they don't recognize him. He locks them up for three days and tells them he believes they are spies, and to prove their innocence, they need to bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, to him. He takes Simeon as collateral. The brothers confess their guilt and regret, and Joseph turns away and weeps. Joseph sneaks the money back into their bags and the brothers go back with their food and money and tell Israel what happened. Reuben volunteers to bring Benjamin to Egypt and swears on his children he will bring the brothers back, but Israel says that he already lost Joseph and if something happens to another brother, he would be completely devastated.

Joseph tells his men to catch up with them and claim that they stole the cup, and that whoever is responsible shall be his servant. They are brought back to Joseph and he tells them that Benjamin is to be his servant, but Judah says he should be the servant instead, for he is responsible for his brother, and if anything were to happen to Benjamin, it would completely devastate their father.

## 45. Joseph Provides for His Brothers and Family

Joseph comes clean and tells his brothers who he is. He weeps and tells them to bring Israel and all the family to come live in Egypt so Joseph can provide for them, and so they will not live in poverty. Pharaoh hears this and tells Joseph he will give his family the best of the land. Joseph gives them supplies for their trip and asks the brothers not to quarrel on the way. When Israel hears the news, he is shocked, and wishes to see Joseph before he dies.

## 46. Joseph Brings His Family to Egypt

God tells Israel not to be afraid and to go to Egypt and that he will make him into a great nation. The whole family (70 people) goes to Egypt and the family is reunited with Joseph.

Pharaoh tells Joseph his family can settle in Goshen. Israel blesses Pharaoh, and Israel says "Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life." Joseph gives his family the land and food.

He tells the Egyptians to sow the land and give one fifth to Pharaoh. Israel's family prospers in Goshen. Israel has Joseph promise that he will bury him in Canaan.

## 48. Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh

Israel is very ill and Joseph brings his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh to see him. Israel adopts them as his own and blesses them. Because he cannot see well, he blesses Ephraim (the younger) as the firstborn. Joseph tries to correct this, but Israel insists that Ephraim will be put before his older brother. He leaves Joseph a mountain slope he took by force from the Amorites.

## 49. Jacob Blesses His Sons

Israel gives each one of his sons a blessing that, reflecting something of their past actions, tells how their descendants will prosper in the future as the twelve tribes of Israel. In his blessing, he gives Judah and Joseph pride of place. Jacob asks to be buried in Canaan with Abraham and Isaac, and breathes his last breath.

## 50. God's Good Purposes / The Death of Joseph

Israel is brought to Canaan to be buried. Joseph's brothers pass on a message to him from Israel saying, "Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin." Joseph responds kindly saying, "You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good." Joseph comforts them and speaks kindly to them. As Joseph is dying, he assures his brothers that God will bring them back to Canaan. He has the brothers promise to take his bones back to Canaan. He dies at 110 years old and is embalmed and put in a coffin in Egypt.
