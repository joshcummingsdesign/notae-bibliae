## Synopsis

<Definition lang="greek" anchor="genesis" text="Genesis"/> (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="bereshit" text="Bereshit"/>*) is about the creation and the fall of man, and God's plan to redeem all nations through Abraham.

## 1. Creation of the World

God speaks light into the world and creates and orders the universe. He creates man in his own image, and tells him to multiply and fill the earth and subdue it (maintain the order).

## 2. God Rests / Creation of Man and Woman

God rests on the seventh day. God makes man (Adam) from dust and puts him in Eden to work it and keep it. He tells Adam not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. God looks to create a helper (in Hebrew, "a helper against him") for Adam. He brings Adam every living creature, and Adam names them, but is still not satisfied. God creates woman from Adam's rib while he is sleeping, and Adam calls her woman because she was taken out of man.

## 3. The Fall

A serpent tells the woman to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil and she does and gives some to Adam. They realize they are naked and hide ashamed and afraid of God. God confronts them and Adam blames the woman, and she blames the serpent. God curses the snake and says the woman's offspring (he) will bruise his head and he (snake) shall bruise his heel. For the woman, God multiplies pain from childbirth and says there will be conflict in marriage. For Adam, God curses the ground, makes man struggle to eat, and says he will return to the dust from which he came. Adam names her Eve (life-giver) because she is the mother of all the living. God makes garments of skins and clothes them, and states that man has become like God in knowing good and evil. He drives them out of Eden and places the cherubim and flaming sword to guard the Tree of Life.

## 4. Cain & Abel

Adam and Eve have Cain and Abel. Cain and Abel each bring an offering to God. God has regard for Abel, but not Cain. Cain is jealous and God warns him of sin. Cain kills his brother out of jealousy. God curses the ground for Cain and makes him a fugitive to be alienated from the ground and God. Cain worries of getting killed. God puts a mark on him and states sevenfold vengeance will come to anyone who kills him. Cain settles east of Eden and his descendant Lamech ends up worse than he does claiming seventy-seven-fold vengeance. Seth (Noah's ancestor) is born.

## 5. Adam's Descendants to Noah

Adam's descendants to Noah (sounds like the Hebrew word for "rest")

## 6. Corruption on Earth / Noah and the Flood

The "sons of God" begin to multiply on earth with human wives spawning Nephilim (translation: fallen ones), who are mighty men. God numbers man's days at 120 years. Man begins to spread wickedness and God regrets making man and decides to flood the earth. He decides to save righteous Noah and tells him to build an ark and establishes a covenant with him. Noah does all that God commanded him.

## 7. Noah and the Flood

God tells Noah that in seven days it will rain for forty days and forty nights. Noah takes his family into the ark. The floods blot out all living things and the waters prevail for 150 days.

## 8. The Flood Subsides / God's Covenant with Noah

The flood subsides. God tells Noah that man and all living things should go forth and multiply. Noah builds an altar to the Lord and offers burnt offerings. God says never again shall he flood the earth.

## 9. God's Covenant with Noah / Noah's Fall

God tells Noah to multiply and fill the earth and says that flesh shall not be eaten with its blood and that blood shall be shed for whoever sheds the blood of man. God establishes his covenant with Noah that never again shall he flood the earth. The rainbow shall be a sign of this covenant. Noah plants a vineyard and gets drunk. Ham shames his father and Noah curses his son Canaan and gives Shem pride of place.

## 10. Nations Descended from Noah

Nations descended from Noah's sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, each with their own languages.

## 11. The Tower of Babel

People migrate from the east and speak one language, the antithesis of what God commanded. They are proud of their new technology (the brick) and they build a tower out of arrogance. God sees the tower, confuses their language, and scatters them. City is called Babel because of this. Babel = Babylon, symobilizes humanity's ambition to dethrone God and make the earth its own. The chapter ends with Shem's descendants to Abram (translation: exalted father).

## 12. The Call of Abram

God calls Abram to travel to a land that will become his so that God may make him a great nation and bless him and make his name great so that all the families of the earth shall be blessed. He travels with his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot from Haran to Canaan near the oak of Moreh where God promises his offspring the land. Abram builds an altar there and then settles between Bethel and Ai where he builds another altar. There is a great famine in Canaan, so he travels to Egypt, but he is worried he will be killed when they see his beautiful wife Sarai, so he tells her to pretend she is his sister. Pharaoh takes her into his harem of wives and God brings a plague to him. Pharaoh sends Abram and Sarai away.

## 13. Abram & Lot Separate

Abram goes to Negeb and becomes rich. He then goes back to the place between Bethel and Ai and there is not enough land to support both him and Lot. Lot sees the Jourdan Valley is the most fruitful like the Lord's garden, so he settles in Sodom which ends up being full of wicked people. Abram moves to Canaan. God tells Abram that all the land he can see will belong to his offspring (of which there will be many). Abram moves to Hebron and builds an altar.

## 14. Abram Rescues Lot

Lot is taken captive by an alliance of four kings who invade Sodom and Gomorrah and defeat a local confederation of five kings. Abram gets word of this and leads a small force of 318 men into the Jourdan Valley to recover all the people and possessions including his nephew Lot. Melchizedek (translates to "King of Righteousness"), the king of Salem (translates to *peace*, it is the ancient name of Jerusalem which means *possession of peace*) and also a priest, brings out wine and bread and blesses Abram. Abram gives Melchizedek a tenth of everything. The king of Sodom offers him riches, but Abram rejects, affirming that he is depending on God, not human kings or their gifts to become a great nation.

## 15. God's Covenant with Abram

Abram sees God in a vision and expresses his worry about not having any children. God tells him to count the stars in the sky, and that's how many offspring he will have. Abram trusts in God, and his faith is counted as righteousness. Abram asks God how he will know he and his descendants will possess the land of Canaan. Got tells him to bring a heifer, goat, ram, turtledove, and pigeon (all three years old). He cuts them all in half (except for the birds). In a dream, God says that his descendants will travel to a land and be servants there for 400 years, but he will bring judgement and they will come out with great possessions and return to Canaan. When he wakes up, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch pass between the animal pieces (in this ritual a servant would typically walk through the king's pieces to signify he would be cut up like the pieces if he breaks the covenant, but here the fire represents God passing between the pieces Himself). God makes a covenant with Abram that the land will belong to his offspring.

## 16. Sarai and Hagar

Sarai cannot have children so she tells Abram that her servant Hagar will be their surrogate. Hagar gets pregnant and begins showing contempt for Sarai because she cannot bear children. Sarai deals with her harshly and Hagar runs away. The angel of the Lord finds her near a well and tells her to submit to Sarai and that her son's name will be Ishmael (translation "God Hears") and that he will be stubborn and live a life of hostility. She is awestruck that God sees her and the well is named Beer-lahai-roi (translation "well of the Living One who sees me"). Ishmael is born.

## 17. Abraham and the Covenant of Circumcision

God appears to Abram and makes a covenant that he shall be the father of many nations and tells him that his name shall be Abraham (translation: father of a multitude). Circumcision will be the sign of the covenant (eight days of age). God tells Abraham that his wife Sarai is now to be called Sarah, and that she will bear him a son named Isaac. Although God gives Isaac pride of place, he blesses Ishmael and says he will become a great nation. Abraham then circumcises all the men of his house.

## 18. Abraham Intercedes for Sodom

Three men show up at Abraham's tent and he recognizes that one of the visitors is a divine manifestation. He shows great hospitality to the men and the Lord says that he will return next year and although she is very old, Sarah will have a son. The Lord looks to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because wickedness is very bad there. Abraham, knowing Lot is in Sodom, intercedes asking God to do what is just by not sweeping away the innocent with the wicked. God agrees that if there are ten righteous people found in Sodom, he will not destroy it.

## 19. God Rescues Lot

The two angels go to visit Lot in Sodom and he shows them hospitality. The men of the city go to rape the two "men", but in a dispicable act of desperation, Lot offers his two daughters. This angers the men and they go to attack him, but the two "men" strike them blind. The angels tell Lot to flee to the hills because Sodom will be destroyed for its wickedness. Lot tries to tell his sons-in-law, but they think he is joking. Lot lingers there, so the angels pull him, his wife, and his two daughters out of Sodom. He settles in Zoar. God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah with sulfur and fire. Lot's wife doesn't heed the angels' warning, looks back, and is turned to a pillar of salt. Abraham sees the smoke in the valley. Lot moves into the hills and his two daughters are so worried that they will never conceive that they get him drunk and bear his children who become the Moabites and the Ammonites.

## 20. Abraham and Abimelech

Abraham doesn't learn his lesson and once again tells someone Sarah is his sister for his own self-protection. This time it's with the king of Gerar, Abimelech. Abimelech takes Sarah into his harem of wives and God visits him in a dream to warn him of the consequences of sleeping with Sarah because she is the wife of a prophet (Abraham). Abimilech proclaims his innocence and confronts Abraham. Abraham mischaracterizes the people of Gerar as not being God-fearing. Abimelech shows generosity by giving Abraham riches. Abraham prays and God vindicates Abimelech.

## 21. The Birth of Isaac

Isaac is born. Abraham makes a feast on the day Isaac is weaned and Ishmael begins to mock. Sarah gets angry, says that Ishmael will not be an heir with Isaac, and casts him and Hagar away. God tells Abraham not to worry because he will make Ishmeal a great nation. Hagar and Ishmael wander through the desert and she believes Ishmael will die of thirst. The angel of God visits Hagar and shows her to a well. Ishmael grows up to be a great hunter. Abimelech seizes a well from Abraham. Abraham and Abimelech make a treaty and Abraham gives Abimelech seven ewe lambs to secure ownership of the well (Beersheba).

## 22. The Sacrifice of Isaac

God tells Abraham to sacrifice Isaac in the land of Moriah in the mountains. As he is about to do it, God stops him and provides a ram instead. Abraham calls the place "The Lord will provide", and it is said, "On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided." God reaffirms his commitment to Abraham that in his offspring all nations of the earth shall be blessed.

## 23. Sarah's Death and Burial

Sarah dies and Abraham negotiates a burial spot for her in Canaan in the cave of Machpelah (east of Hebron), the land that God promised him.

## 24. Isaac and Rebekah

Abraham, concerned that there are no Godly men in Canaan, has a servant go out to the land of his father (Nahor) to find Isaac a wife. The servant goes to Nahor and God guides him to Rebeka, a member of Abraham's clan. Rebekah agrees to marry Isaac and the family gives their blessing. She travels with the servant back to Canaan where she meets Isaac and marries him. He falls in love with her and is comforted after his mother's death.

## 25. Abraham's Death & His Descendants

Abraham remarries to Keturah and has six children. Abraham gives all that he has to Isaac. Abraham dies and is buried with his wife Sarah in Canaan. Isaac and Rebekah have twins, Esau (hunter, loved by father) and Jacob (name means "he who takes by the heel" or "supplanter", quiet, loved by mother), and God says that the older shall serve the younger. Jacob convinces Esau to sell him his birthright when Esau is hungry and Jacob has stew.

## 26. God's Promise to Isaac

There is a famine and Isaac goes to Gerar. God reaffirms his promise to Isaac. Isaac lies and says Rebekah is his sister, the same way his father did. Abimelech rebukes Isaac and protects him and Rebekah. Isaac becomes very rich. Abimelech sends him away. He ends up in Beersheba where the Lord blesses him and he builds an altar. He makes a treaty with Abimelech. Isaac's son Esau takes two wives and makes life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.

## 27. Isaac Blesses Jacob

Isaac is old and is unable to see. He tells Esau to go and bring him some food so he may bless him. Rebekah tells Jacob to bring the food while Esau is out hunting. Jacob brings Isaac the food and he is blessed instead. Esau comes back and is very angry and wishes to kill Jacob. Rebekah tells Jacob to flee to Laban, her brother in Haran (Paddam-aran), until Esau calms down.

## 28. Jacob Sent to Laban / Jacob's Dream

To avoid having Jacob marry a Canaanite, Isaac sends him to Laban to marry one of their clan. Esau takes a third wife, the daughter of Ishmael. Between Beersheba and Haran, Jacob has a dream that there is a ladder leading from earth to heaven where angels are descending, and God stands beside him and reaffirms his promise to Abraham (symbolizing that man's desire is to climb the ladder like in the Tower of Babel, when God is really interested in climbing down and dwelling among his people). He is so moved that he builds a pillar (not an altar, implying he is not yet committed to the Lord) and calls the place Bethel (the house of God). Jacob (still ambivalent regarding his commitment to the Lord) vows to worship God and give Him one tenth of everything (later becomes known as a tithe, or one tenth of a worshiper's income) he is given if God is with him on his journey.

## 29. Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel

Jacob falls in love with Rachel, Laban's daughter, and agrees to work for Laban for seven years for her hand in marriage. On their wedding night, Laban sends his eldest daughter Leah to sleep with him instead. In the morning, Jacob is confused and Laban says it is not customary for the younger to be given before the firstborn. He agrees to work another seven years for Rachel's hand in marriage and they are married. He loves Rachel more than Leah. Leah ends up having four sons and Rachel has none.

## 30. Jacob's Children & Prosperity

Rachel cannot have children and has her servant Bilhah be the surrogate to two sons. Leah cannot have children so she has her servant Zilpah be the surrogate to two sons. Leah ends up having two more sons and a daughter. Rachel ends up having a son Joseph. Jacob has made Laban very wealthy and Jacob asks him to let him go so he can return home with his family. Laban agrees to pay Jacob with his speckled and spotted sheep, but Laban secretly removes them from his flock and gives them to his sons instead. Over the course of six years, Jacob begins selectively breeding speckled and spotted sheep from the strongest of the bunch to be his sheep, and leaves the weaker ones for Laban. Jacob becomes very wealthy.

## 31. Jacob Flees from Laban

Tension is growing between Laban and Jacob, so he decides to take his family and all his possessions and return to Canaan. While Laban is shearing his sheep, Rachel steals her father's "gods" and they leave to Gilead. Laban finds out and goes to follow them, but God warns him not to say anything to Jacob. Laban confronts Jacob anyway. He looks for his "gods", but Rachel hides them. Jacob tries to reason with him saying he has given him twenty years of work. Jacob sets up a pillar with a single stone called Mizpah (watchpost) and Laban and his kinsmen make a heap of stones called Galeed (heap of witness) to be a witness between them. They make a covenant and Laban returns home.

## 32. Jacob Wrestles with God

Jacob gets word that his brother Esau is coming to see him and is bringing 400 men with him. He is very scared so he divides into two camps, says a prayer (the first time he addresses God as O Lord) that he is unworthy of God's steadfast love and faithfulness, and ask for God to deliver him from the hand of his brother. He sends his servants ahead of him with animal gifts to try and appease him before they meet. That night, he sends his wife and servants across the Jabbok river. When he is alone, Jacob wrestles with a "man" and wins. The "man" touches Jacob's hip socket and puts it out of joint. Jacob won't let the "man" go unless he blesses him. The "man" says his name is no longer Jacob, but is Israel because he has striven with God and has prevailed. He calls the place Peniel (translation: the face of God).

## 33. Jacob Meets Esau

Jacob meets Esau and Esau runs to meet him and embraces him. Jacob offers him the animal gift and Esau graciously declines. Jacob insists. Esau invites Jacob to return to Seir with him, but Jacob uses travel-weariness as an excuse to head off to Succoth and then off to Shechem in Canaan. Jacob buys Shechem (the land) from Hamor, the father of Shechem (the person), for a hundred pieces of money and builds an altar there and calls it El-Elohe-Israel (God, the God of Israel).

## 34. The Defiling of Dinah

Jacob's daughter Dinah is raped by Shechem and her brothers are furious. Shechem begs for her hand in marriage, but the brothers say only if every male in his clan is circumcised. All the men get circumcised and when they are sore, Dina's brothers Simeon and Levi kill and rob them and take their sister out of Shechem's house. Jacob tells his sons they have brought trouble on him.

## 35. God Blesses and Renames Jacob

God tells Jacob to go to Bethel, so he has his family put away their "foreign gods" and travel with him there to build an altar to God. God protects them on their journey and the altar is built. God changes his name to Israel and says many nations shall come from him, and the land he gave to Abraham and Isaac will belong to him and his offspring. They then travel to Bethlehem, and on the way, Rachel dies from complications during the birth of her son Benjamin. Reuben (Leah and Jacob's oldest son) sleeps with Bilhah (one of Jacob's surrogates) and Jacob hears about it. Isaac dies and Esau and Jacob bury him.

## 36. Esau's Descendants

Esau marries three wives who are Canaanites and they have many children. He moves from Canaan to Seir because his possessions are too great to dwell with Jacob. His descendants assume control of Seir, renaming it Edom.

## 37. Joseph's Dreams

Israel favors Joseph (he even makes him a colorful robe) and his brothers become very jealous and hate him. Joseph has two dreams that represent him exercising authority over his family. Israel rebukes him and his brothers' jealousy continues to grow. They plot to kill him, but Reuben stops them. Judah convinces his brothers (save for Reuben) to sell him to the Ishmaelites who take him to Egypt where he becomes the servant of Potiphar, an important member of Pharaoh's royal court. The brothers tell Israel that Joseph was torn to pieces by a fierce animal and he is devastated.

## 38. Judah and Tamar

Judah has three sons, Er, Onan, and Shelah. His first two sons die and Er's widow Tamar goes to her father's house to wait for Shelah to grow up. She puts on a vail and Judah mistakes her for a prostitute and she conceives twins (Perez and Zerah) by him.

## 39. Joseph and Potiphar's Wife

God is with Joseph and makes him successful in all that he does, and he becomes overseer of the house, and God blesses the house. Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph but he declines. She then makes up a story and tells Potiphar that they slept together. Potiphar throws Joseph in prison, but God is with him and makes him the keeper of the prison and makes him succeed in all that he does.

## 40. Joseph Interprets Two Prisoners' Dreams

Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker get put in prison. They each have dreams and tell them to Jacob. Jacob tells the cupbearer his dream means he will be released in three days, and to remember him and tell Pharaoh his story. He tells the baker that he will be hanged in three days. Jacob is right and the events play out, but the cupbearer doesn't remember him.

## 41. Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams

Pharaoh has two dreams that he wishes to be interpreted. The cupbearer remembers Joseph and he is brought before Pharaoh to interpret the dreams. He tells Pharaoh that the dreams mean there will be seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. He suggests storing food for the famine. Pharaoh appoints him as second in command and he stores up food. Joseph marries Asenath and has two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. When the famine comes, everyone comes to Joseph to buy grain.

## 42. Joseph's Brothers Go to Egypt

All of Joseph's brothers except Benjamin go to Egypt to buy grain not knowing that the second in command is Joseph. He recognizes them, but they don't recognize him. He locks them up for three days and tells them he believes they are spies, and to prove their innocence, they need to bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, to him. He takes Simeon as collateral. The brothers confess their guilt and regret, and Joseph turns away and weeps. Joseph sneaks the money back into their bags and the brothers go back with their food and money and tell Israel what happened. Reuben volunteers to bring Benjamin to Egypt and swears on his children he will bring the brothers back, but Israel says that he already lost Joseph and if something happens to another brother, he would be completely devastated.

## 43. Joseph's Brothers Return to Egypt

Israel's family needs more food, so Judah proposes they go back to Egypt and take Benjamin with them. Judah claims responsibility for anything that may happen. They take Benjamin, gifts, and twice the money and go to Egypt. Joseph sees Benjamin and brings Simeon back and has a feast prepared. Joseph weeps when he sees Benjamin. They all have a feast.

## 44. Joseph Tests His Brothers

Joseph puts his silver cup in Benjamin's bag before he sends them back home. Joseph tells his men to catch up with them and claim that they stole the cup, and that whoever is responsible shall be his servant. They are brought back to Joseph and he tells them that Benjamin is to be his servant, but Judah says he should be the servant instead, for he is responsible for his brother, and if anything were to happen to Benjamin, it would completely devastate their father.

## 45. Joseph Provides for His Brothers and Family

Joseph comes clean and tells his brothers who he is. He weeps and tells them to bring Israel and all the family to come live in Egypt so Joseph can provide for them, and so they will not live in poverty. Pharaoh hears this and tells Joseph he will give his family the best of the land. Joseph gives them supplies for their trip and asks the brothers not to quarrel on the way. When Israel hears the news, he is shocked, and wishes to see Joseph before he dies.

## 46. Joseph Brings His Family to Egypt

God tells Israel not to be afraid and to go to Egypt and that he will make him into a great nation. The whole family (70 people) goes to Egypt and the family is reunited with Joseph. Joseph tells them to tell Pharaoh that they are shepherds so that they can dwell in Goshen since shepherds are looked down upon in Egypt.

## 47. Jacob's Family Settles in Goshen

Pharaoh tells Joseph his family can settle in Goshen. Israel blesses Pharaoh, and Israel says "Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life." Joseph gives his family the land and food. The famine is very great and the Egyptians give Joseph and Pharaoh all of their money, livestock, land, and ultimately themselves as servants in exchange for seeds. He tells the Egyptians to sow the land and give one fifth to Pharaoh. Israel's family prospers in Goshen. Israel has Joseph promise that he will bury him in Canaan.

## 48. Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh

Israel is very ill and Joseph brings his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh to see him. Israel adopts them as his own and blesses them. Because he cannot see well, he blesses Ephraim (the younger) as the firstborn. Joseph tries to correct this, but Israel insists that Ephraim will be put before his older brother. He leaves Joseph a mountain slope he took by force from the Amorites.

## 49. Jacob Blesses His Sons

Israel gives each one of his sons a blessing that, reflecting something of their past actions, tells how their descendants will prosper in the future as the twelve tribes of Israel. In his blessing, he gives Judah and Joseph pride of place. Jacob asks to be buried in Canaan with Abraham and Isaac, and breathes his last breath.

## 50. God's Good Purposes / The Death of Joseph

Israel is brought to Canaan to be buried. Joseph's brothers pass on a message to him from Israel saying, "Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin." Joseph responds kindly saying, "You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good." Joseph comforts them and speaks kindly to them. As Joseph is dying, he assures his brothers that God will bring them back to Canaan. He has the brothers promise to take his bones back to Canaan. He dies at 110 years old and is embalmed and put in a coffin in Egypt.
