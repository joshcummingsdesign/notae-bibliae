## Synopsis

Numbers (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="bamidbar" text="Bamidbar" />*, Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="arithmoi" text="Arithmoi" />*) is the journey of Moses and the Israelites as they travel through the wilderness to the verge of the promised land.

## Mt. Sinai

* * *

## 1. A Census of Israel's Warriors

The Israelites have been at Mount Sinai for one year. God speaks to Moses in the tabernacle (Moses couldn't enter the tabernacle at the end of Exodus, but after the laws of Leviticus, he is able to enter) and tells him to number all of the males over 20 years old from each tribe who are able to go to war. The total number is 603,550, with the tribe of Judah being the largest. It is estimated that the total number of people was about 2 million. The Levites are not listed in the count because their job is to oversee and protect the tabernacle. This includes killing any outsider that comes near it.

## 2. Arrangement of the Camp

God tells Moses and Aaron the arrangement of the camp. The tabernacle is to be in the center of the camp, with the other camps facing it according to rank, each with the banners of their fathers' houses. On the east—Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. On the south—Reuben, Simeon, Gad. On the west—Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin. On the north—Dan, Asher, Naphtali. This order is to be maintained on the march.

## 3. The Sons of Aaron

The Levites are to guard the tabernacle, priests, and congregation. God speaks to Moses and tells him he has taken the Levites in place of every firstborn Israelite, and tells him the arrangement and responsibilities of the Levites in the camp. On the east—Moses and the priests [tabernacle and people]. On the south—Kohathites (Elizaphan) [items within the tabernacle]. On the west—Gershonites (Eliasaph) [coverings, hangings, entrance screens of tent and court]. On the north—Merarites (Zuriel) [structural components of the tabernacle and court]. God tells Moses to count every firstborn of Israel from a month old and up, and there are 273 more of them than the Levites, so they must pay a redemption price of five shekels per person to the sanctuary.

## 4. Duties of the Kohathites, Ghersonites, & Merarites

A census is taken of the Levites who are between 30 and 50 years old since they will need to do the heavy lifting of transporting the tabernacle. The Kohathite priests under the direction of Eleazar (Aaron's son) handle the most holy items of the tabernacle, but the non-priestly Kohathites are not even to look at them, lest they die. The more holy the item, the more layers of cloth are wrapped around them. The Gersonites under the direction of Ithamar shall be in charge of the coverings, hangings, and entrance screens of the tent and court. The Merarites under the direction of Ithamar are to be in charge of the structural components of the tabernacle and court. The Levites are the smallest tribe, but have the greatest responsibility of protecting the tabernacle and serving as mediators between the Lord and his people.

## Laws About Ritual Purity

* * *

## 5. Cleansing the Camp

God commands that unclean people remain outside the camp. Those who commit sin are to confess and make restitution adding a fifth to it to the person he or she wronged. If there is no one to receive the restitution, it goes to the priest. If a man is suspicious that his wife has been unfaithful, he is to bring her to the priest with a grain offering of jealousy, and the priest will have the woman drink holy water containing dust from the tabernacle floor. If she is guilty, she will be cursed and childless.

## 6a. The Nazarite Vow

When a person makes the vow of a Nazarite (translation: one separated), they are to abstain from drinking alcohol and eating anything produced by the grapevine, refrain from cutting their hair, and not to go near a dead body during the time of their vow. If someone dies near them, they are to shave their head on the seventh day of their cleansing, bring two turtledoves or two pigeons for a sin offering and a burnt offering on the eighth day, and start the vow over. When the time of the vow is completed, they are to bring a burnt offering, sin offering, peace offering, grain offering, and drink offering to the tabernacle. They are to shave their head and put the hair under the fire of the peace offering. After this, the Nazarite may drink wine. A Nazarite may go above this as he or she is able to afford.

## 6b. Aaron's Blessing

The Lord speaks a blessing to Moses for Aaron to bless the people of Israel. "The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace."

## 7. Offerings at the Tabernacle's Consecration

When Moses finishes setting up the tabernacle (a month earlier), the chiefs of Israel bring twelve oxen (one for each chief) and six wagons (one for every two chiefs) to help the Levites carry the tabernacle. The Gershonites received two wagons and four oxen. The Merarites received four wagons and eight oxen. The Kohathites received none since they were in charge of carrying the items within the tabernacle on poles over their shoulders. On 12 successive days, each chief (starting with the tribe of Judah and working around the camp clockwise) brings a gift of one silver plate and one silver basin each filled with flour mixed with oil, one golden dish full of incense, and animals for sacrifices to show their equal support for and commitment to the tabernacle. God talks to Moses from the mercy seat in the tabernacle.

## 8. Cleansing of the Levites

God tells Moses to set up the Golden Lampstand so that it lights up the opposite side (the Table of the Bread of the Presence). This signifies God's ongoing intention to bless Israel. The Levites are offered to God instead of every firstborn of Israel, and are to go and serve in the sanctuary. They shave and wash up to cleanse themselves and Aaron consecrates them. Two bulls are offered as a sin offering and a burnt offering to make atonement for the Levites. God tells Moses that the Levites are to work from age 25 to 50 in the sanctuary and then are to simply guard the sanctuary from then on.

## 9. The Passover Celebrated

The first celebration of Passover (the Second Passover) is celebrated. Those who are unclean by touching a dead body cannot not join, but are allowed to celebrate a month later if they so choose. Strangers and sojourners are allowed to join, but if they do they have to keep to the same statutes. The tabernacle is set up and the cloud of God's presence covers it. Whenever the cloud is over the tabernacle, they remain in camp, but when it lifts, they set out. "At the command of the Lord they camped, and at the command of the Lord they set out."

## 10a. The Silver Trumpets

God commands Moses to make two silver trumpets for summoning the congregation and for breaking camp. Two trumpets means the entire congregation is to gather, one trumpet means just the chiefs are to gather. Blowing an alarm means the camps on the east are to set out, and a second alarm means the camps on the south are to set out. They are to also be used for war and for festivals, but ultimately they symbolize a plea to God to remember his people.

## Travel Pt. 1

* * *

## 10b. Israel Leaves Sinai

On the 20th day of the second month in the second year, the cloud lifts and Israel heads out of the wilderness of Sinai on a three-day journey to Paran. Moses offers Hobab (his brother-in-law, son of Jethro) a place in the promised land, and he rejects. Moses tells Hobab that in return for him giving them guidance as to where to camp and for looking out for them, God will bless him like they will the Israelites. When the ark sets out Moses says, "Arise, O Lord, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee before you." When the ark rests he says, "Return, O Lord, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel."

## 11. Graves of Craving

The people of Israel again begin complaining and the fire of the Lord consumes some outlying parts of the camp. Moses intercedes and the fire dies down (the place is called Taberah or "Burning"). The people of Israel then start complaining about being tired of eating manna and complain that they want meat like they had in Egypt. Moses laments to the Lord and asks why he is made to carry such a heavy burden. God tells Moses to gather 70 elders so that he can put some of the Spirit on them and help him bear the burden. God promises to give them meat for a month (with some strings attached due to their complaining). Two men, Eldad and Medad, begin to prophesy in the camp and Joshua tells Moses to stop them. Moses doesn't stop them saying he wishes all the Lord's people were prophets. A massive amount of quail migrate north and the people of Israel begin gathering large quantities of them. God strikes them down with a plague because of their greed. The place is called Kibroth-hattaavah (graves of craving). They go on to Hazeroth and camp there.

## 12. Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses

Miriam and Aaron question Moses' authority and unique relationship with God. Moses remains humble and God calls the three of them out to the tent of meeting. God reminds Miriam and Aaron that unlike other prophets, he speaks directly to his servant Moses and not in visions of the night. God rebukes Aaron and Miriam and makes Miriam leprous. Moses intercedes asking for her healing. She is healed, but shut out of the camp for seven days. After the seven days, they head out of Hazeroth and camp in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh.

## Wilderness of Paran

* * *

## 13a. Spies Sent into Canaan

Moses sends 12 spies (one from each tribe, Shammua, Shaphat, Caleb, Igal, Hoshea, Palti, Gaddiel, Gaddi, Ammiel, Sethur, Nahbi, Geuel) to Hebron (burial place of the patriarchs and their wives and place where God promised the land to Abraham) to report back and to bring back some fruit. Moses renames Hoshea (he saves) to Joshua (Yahweh saves). The spies travel from the Negeb to Hebron and see the descendants of Anak (meaning neck, famous for their height) there. They go to the Valley of Eshcol (translation: cluster) where they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes as well as some pomegranates and figs.

## 13b. Report of the Spies

The spies come back to Kadesh after 40 days to report back. They report that the cities are fortified and large, and that there are mighty men living there. Caleb insists they can occupy it, but the other ten men (all but Caleb and Joshua) provide a bad report saying they could not go up against the people, that the land devours its inhabitants, that Nephilim live there (remember, Nephilim were wiped out in the flood), and that the Israelites seemed like grasshoppers to them. This shows their distrust in God.

## 14. The People Rebel

In light of the bad report given by the spies, the people grumble, saying they would rather go back to Egypt. This further shows their distrust in God. Caleb and Joshua remain faithful, but the rest of the people threaten to stone them. God appears before the tent of meeting and tells Moses he will strike them with pestilence and disinherit them. Moses intercedes reminding God of his covenant with Israel. God says that those 20 years and older who grumbled against him will not enter the promised land except Caleb and Joshua, and that they will die in the wilderness. God says they will remain in the wilderness for 40 years (one year for each day the spies were out). The ten spies that provided a bad report are killed by a plague. The people of Israel rebel again and go into the promised land without the presence of God and are defeated by the Amalekites and Canaanites who chase the survivors to Hormah.

## 15. Laws About Sacrifices

God gives further laws about sacrifices which further demonstrate God's faithful devotion to his people, and assures them that when (not if) they enter the promised land, they will have ways to honor Him more abundantly than they are able to in the wilderness. Lamb and bull sacrifices must be accompanied by flour, oil, and wine. God also allows strangers and sojourners to sacrifice as long as they follow the same statutes. God also reaffirms that unintentional sins may be atoned for by offering a sin offering, but adds that a bull and goat must be offered for the congregation, and that the individual may offer only a female goat a year old, not a lamb. Those who sin intentionally will be cut off. A Sabbathbreaker is stoned to death. The Israelites are to wear tassels with a cord of blue on the corner of their clothes to remember the commandments of the Lord.

## 16. Korah's Rebellion

Korah (sons of Levi), Dathan and Abiram (sons of Zebulun), and On (sons of Reuben), take 250 men and rebel against Moses saying that if all the people of Israel are holy, then they should have the rights of priests. Moses reminds Korah that the Levites are already enjoying the privileges of serving in the tabernacle. The Dathan and Abiram complain that they are made to die in the wilderness. Moses tells them to come back the next day with censers and that the Lord will show them who is holy. God wants to strike the whole congregation, but Moses intercedes. God opens the earth and swallows the rebels, and fire consumes the 250 men. God commands Moses to have Eleazar make the 250 censers into hammered plates as a covering for the altar to remind Israel that only the priests are to draw near to burn incense before God. The people grumble against Moses and Aaron accusing them of killing the men, which angers the Lord and a plague begins. Moses has Aaron stand between the dead and the living with his censer to make atonement for the people and the plague is stopped.

## 17. Aaron's Staff Buds

God commands Moses to have one member from each of the tribes of Israel bring a staff with their name so he can bring them to the Most Holy Place (Aaron's name is on the staff of Levi). The next day Aaron's staff sprouts almond blossoms. Moses shows all the staffs to the people and God tells him to place Aaron's staff before the testimony to be kept as a sign for the rebels and the perils of their grumbling. The people seem to be finally convinced about the status of the priests.

## 18. Duties of Priests and Levites

God speaks directly to Aaron, underlining his special status, and commands that his sons are to guard the interior of the tabernacle, and that the Levites are to guard its exterior to prevent intrusion by any unauthorized person, lest they die. This is to insure there will never again be wrath on the people of Israel putting the burden of iniquity on the priests and Levites. God gives the priests portions of the offerings as a gift, but men and the firstborn of unclean animals shall be redeemed for five shekels. Every tithe goes to the Levites for their service in the sanctuary, and the priests get the best tenth (a tithe of a tithe) as they are God's representatives to the people. The priests and Levites shall have no land inheritance as they have a special relationship with God among the people of Israel.

## 19. Laws for Purification

God gives the law to Moses and Aaron for creating and using the cleansing ash. A red heifer (youth represents life, red represents blood for atonement) is slaughtered before Eleazer outside the camp. He sprinkles blood seven times towards the tabernacle, and then it is burned with cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet yarn, and the ashes are gathered. This process makes those involved unclean until the evening. The ashes are used in water to cleanse someone on the third and seventh day of their cleansing. On the seventh day, they are to wash themselves and their clothes. Failure to do so defiles the tabernacle and the person shall be cut off. Hyssop is dipped in the water and sprinkled on the tent, furnishings, and unclean people if someone dies there. (These laws for cleansing are timely due to all of the deaths that will occur over the next 40 years due to the rebellion).

## Travel Pt. 2

* * *

## 20a. The Death of Miriam

After 40 years of the Israeites wandering in the wilderness, Miriam dies in Kadesh and is buried there. This is a turning point because she was Moses' sister and preserver of his life, a prophetess, and the leading woman of Israel.

## 20b. Moses Strikes the Rock

There is no water for the people of Israel and they begin to again complain to Moses and Aaron, even wishing they had died in the plague or in Egypt. Moses and Aaron go to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fall on their faces. God appears and tells Moses to take the staff, assemble the people, and *tell* the rock before them to yield water. Instead of demonstrating the glory of the Lord and upholding Him as holy, Moses loses patience, makes a snide remark about *them* bringing the water from the rock out for them, and strikes the rock twice with the staff. As a result, God forbids the assembly from entering the promised land. The waters are called Meribah (translation: quarreling).

## 20c. Edom Refuses Passage

Moses sends messengers to the king of Edom (Esau's clan) to ask if they can pass through their land to go along the King's Highway, but he and his army refuse to let them pass.

## 20d. The Death of Aaron

The Iasraelites travel from Kadesh to Mount Hor, and God commands that Aaron be stripped of his priestly garments and that they be given to Eleazar (making him the new high priest). God commands that Aaron be left to die on top of the mountain. Moses carries out these commands and the people weep for 30 days.

## 21a. Arad Destroyed

Following the death of Aaron, the Israelites eventually end up in the Negeb (may not be in chronological order) and are confronted by the king of Arad and his army who fight them and take some of them captive. Israel vows that if the Lord makes them victorious, they will devote their cities to destruction. The Lord heeds their request and the place is named Hormah (destruction). Note, the Israelites did not provoke war, but rather responded to an attack.

## 21b. The Bronze Serpent

The Israelites head out from Mount Hor to go around Edom, and the people again start speaking against God and Moses. God sends fiery serpents to bite the people and they begin dying. They confess their sins to Moses and he intercedes. God tells Moses to set a fiery serpent on a pole, and whoever is bitten and sees it shall live (God's justice is a source of life to those who will look to God for healing). Moses does as God commands and makes a bronze serpent and sets it on a pole.

## 21c. The Song of the Well

The people make their way to an area between Moab and the Amorites. The Book of the Wars of the Lord is mentioned (perhaps a collection of ancient songs). They continue on and the Lord tells Moses to gather the people together so he can provide water for them. The place is named Beer (translation: well). The people sing in celebration of finding the abundant well. They continue on to the valley in Moab.

## 21d. King Sihon Defeated

The people of Israel go to Sihon, king of the Amorites who defeated the king of Moab, to see if they can pass through their land to go along the King's Highway. He refuses and sends an army out to fight Israel. They defeat the Amorites and take all the cities of Heshbon and settle there. A poem celebrating the capture of Moabite territory by Sihon is cited here. Note, since the Amorites defeated the Moabites, and Israel defeated the Amorites, victory over the Moabites is imminent.

## 21e. King Og Defeated

Moses sends spies out to Jazer and they drive out the Amorites there. They then go to Bashan and the king, Og, sends an army to battle them in Edrei. The Lord tells Moses not to fear because they will do to him as they did to Sihon. They defeat the army and possess the land.

## Plains of Moab

* * *

## 22a. Balak Summons Balaam

Israel goes on to the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, and Moab and Midian are scared of them because of their reputation. Balak, the king of Moab, goes to a non-Israelite prophet, or "seer of the gods", named Balaam (from Aram) to curse them. Balak sends princes with money to Balaam, but God tells Balaam he is not to curse the Israelites. Balak tries again, but this time offers him more money and honor. Balaam wants the money and honor, so he takes things up one more time with God. God tells him he may go with the princes, but must only do what he says. Balaam gets on his donkey and goes with the princes.

## 22b. Balaam's Donkey and the Angel

God gets angry with Balaam (likely for his greed, just wanting the money) and sends an angel to stand in his way. Two times, his donkey sees the angel and goes off course so Balaam strikes him. On the third time the donkey lies down and Balaam strikes him and the donkey speaks to him and asks him why he struck him. God opens his eyes to the angel holding a sword who tells him he has come to oppose him for his perverse ways, and was about to kill him had his donkey not stopped. Balaam confesses his sin, and the angel tells him he may go with the princes, but must only say what the angel tells him. Balaam arrives, and Balak takes him to Bamoth-baal where he sees a fraction of the Israelites.

## 23a. Balaam's First Oracle

At Bamoth-baal, Balaam tells Balak to build seven altars and sacrifice seven bulls and seven rams and to stand beside his burnt offering. Balaam goes to a high point and God tells him what to say. He tells Balak that he cannot curse Israel because God Himself has not cursed or denounced them. He also tells him that their numbers are innumerable, and says, "Let me die the death of the upright, and let my end be like his!" This further affirms God's promise to Abraham to make him a great nation and bless him and make his name great so that all the families of the earth shall be blessed.

## 23b. Balaam's Second Oracle

Frustrated that Blaam has not cursed the Israelites, Balak takes him to the top of Pisgah and again builds seven altars and sacrifices seven bulls and seven rams. Balaam tells him to stand beside his burnt offering and goes to a high point and God tells Balaam what to say. He tells Balak that God is not man and does not lie, nor does he change his mind, and that he has been commanded to bless Israel, that God is with Israel, and warns Balak not to attack them, and compares them to a fierce lioness.

## 24a. Balaam's Third Oracle

Again, frustrated Balaam has not cursed Israel, Balak takes him to the top of Peor and again builds seven altars and sacrifices seven bulls and seven rams. This time, the Spirit of God comes upon Balaam and he blesses Israel. He sees the intricate design of the camp is indeed the work of God and God's people, and prophesies that Israel will live in an abundant land, and they will defeat Agag (king of the Amalek) and all of their adversaries. He again warns Balak of attacking them, and says about them, "Blessed are those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you." Balak is furious and makes an empty and untrue claim that God has held Balaam back from his honor for not cursing Israel.

## 24b. Balaam's Final Oracle

Balaam prophesies once more telling Balak that a king shall come out of Israel and defeat Moab, defeating Sheth (probably nomads in Canaan), and Edom (a.k.a. Seir) along the way. He then prophesies that the Amalekites will be defeated, Asshur (probably a tribe in northern Sinai) will defeat the Kenites (a tribe on good terms with Israel), and that Kittim (probably the Philistines) will defeat Asshur and Eber (probably Cyprus). Balaam and Balak return home. Note, these prophecies all find their focus in the time of David.

## 25. Baal Worship at Peor

While Balaam is blessing Israel in Peor, the Israelites are tempted by the Moabite women who convince them to worship Baal, the Canaanite fertility god. This scene is reminiscent of the golden calf. God tells Moses to publicly execute the chiefs of Israel, and Moses has the judges of Israel kill those who commited idolatry. Right after that, Zimri (son of Salu, chief of the Simeonites) brings a Midianite woman into a tent near the tabernacle. God sends a plague, so Phinehas (Eleazar's son) executes them on the spot, and the plague is stopped (24,000 people die). Phinehas is commended and given perpetual priesthood for his actions, and God tells Moses to strike down the Midianites.

## 26. The New Generation

Go has Moses and Eleazar take a census of the people of Israel who are 20 and older who are able to go to war. From largest to smallest they are Judah, Dan, Issachar, Zebulun, Asher, Manasseh, Benjamin, Naphtali, Reuben, Gad, Ephraim, and Simeon. The total number is 601,730. Simeon's numbers are significantly less (most likely due to the plague caused by Zimri). The size of the inheritance will be commensurate with the size of the tribe, and will be divided by lot (guarantees divine oversight and prevents favoritism). Levi is counted, but they don't get an inheritance as mentioned previously. All the older generation has died off except Caleb and Joshua as expected due to the rebellion.

## 27a. The Daughters of Zelophehad

The daughters of Zelophehad (Joseph's descendant) come to Moses and tell him their father did not rebel, but died in the wilderness of his own sin, and had no sons, and they should receive the inheritance so their family name won't be forgotten. God tells Moses to give them the inheritance and makes a statute that if a man has no sons, the inheritance goes to his daughter, and if he has no daughter, it goes to the brothers, uncles, or closest family member.

## 27b. Joshua to Succeed Moses

God calls Moses to the mountain of Abarim to see the promised land and to die for his sins at Meribah. Moses speaks to God and asks for someone to succeed him in leading the people of Israel. God appoints Joshua, and tells Moses to lay his hands on him and invest him with some of his authority in front of Eleazar the congregation. Moses does as the Lord commands him.

## 28–29. Calendar of Public Sacrifices

Before his death, the Lord speaks to Moses the laws of public sacrifices. Most of the sacrifices are burnt offerings, but goats are offered as sin offerings. Grain and drink offerings were made with each offering according to the type and number of animals being sacrificed. These laws show the importance of the sacrificial system in Israel, affirm to Israel that they will become prosperous in the promised land, and highlight the sabbatical principle. Note: In ancient Jewish culture, the day begins at sunset (Gen. 1:5).

**Daily offerings —** 2 male lambs (1 morning, 1 twilight)

**Sabbath offerings —** 2 male lambs

**Monthly offerings —** 2 bulls, 1 ram, 7 male lambs a year old (beginning of month)

**Passover offerings —** 2 bulls, 1 ram, 7 male lambs a year old, 1 male goat (each day)

**Feast of Weeks offerings —** 2 bulls, 1 ram, 7 male lambs a year old, 1 male goat

**Feast of Trumpets offerings —** 1 bull, 1 ram, 7 male lambs a year old, 1 male goat

**Day of Atonement offerings —** 1 bull, 1 ram, 7 male lambs a year old, 1 male goat

**Feast of Booths offerings —** 13 bulls, 2 rams, 14 male lambs a year old, 1 male goat (each of the 8 days, the number of bulls decrease by 1 until the 8th day when 1 bull is offered, 7 lambs are offered, 1 ram is offered, and 1 goat is offered)

## 30. The Obligations of Vows

With a potential war in Canaan on the horizon, God speaks to Moses the laws for vows. In a crisis, people make vows such as, "If God delivers me from X, I promise to do Y." A man is always obligated to fulfil his vow. A woman is obligated to fulfil her vow unless the head of the family (father or husband) makes it null and void as soon as he hears it. A husband who hears his wife's vow and objects at a later time will bear her iniquity.

## 31. Vengeance on Midian

While the Israelites are by the Jordan at Jericho, we find out that Balaam advised the Midianite women to seduce the Israelites into worshiping Baal at Peor. Because of this, God calls Moses to send a thousand men from each tribe to avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites before his death. Phinehas goes as chaplain to the army. They kill the five kings of Midian (Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba) as well as every male (including Balaam), plunder them, and bring the plunder (including women and children) back to Moses and Eleazar by the Jordan at Jericho. Moses orders that all the captives except the virgin women be killed, and that the Israelite soldiers are to purify themselves and the captives afterward. The spoils get divided between the soldiers and the rest of the congregation. The soldiers give one tenth of one percent (one-five-hundredth) to the priests, and the congregation gives one percent (one-fiftieth) to the Levites. A head count reveals no losses, and all the gold is brought to the tabernacle to make atonement and to serve as a memorial for the people of Israel before the Lord.

## 32. Reuben and Gad settle in Gilead

The people of Reuben and the people of Gad see that the kingdoms of Sihon and Og (Transjordan, Gilead, outside the promised land, across the Jordan River) were good for their livestock, so they ask Moses for the land. They make a vow and Moses agrees to give them the land if their men cross the Jordan to go and fight with the rest of Israel for the promised land. Moses wants to prevent a similar plague to the one caused by the spies that rebelled and turned away from God's plan for Israel. They agree to build cities for their children and livestock and go to fight with Israel. Moses gives them the land, and they build fortified cities and folds for sheep there. The sons of Machir (son of Manasseh) capture the northern part of the land from the Amorites (northern Gilead is within the boundaries of Canaan), and Moses gives this land to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Jair (son of Manasseh) and Nobah (tribe of Manasseh) capture villages there.

## 33. Recounting Israel's Journey

This part of the book is explicitly said to be written by Moses and is his testimony of what God has done for Israel during his lifetime. It starts with them setting out from Ramses on the day after the Passover, after the Lord executed judgments on the Egyptians and their gods. He then traces the Israelites' journey as they went from Ramses to Succoth to Sinai to Kadesh at Mount Hor where Aaron died, listing each specific campsite along the way. He then continues tracing their journey from Mount Hor to Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab, again listing each specific campsite along the way. The Lord then speaks to Moses and commands that when they enter the land of Canaan, they are to drive out all the inhabitants of the land and divide the land according to the size of each tribe. God warns that if they do not drive out all the inhabitants, there will be affliction.

## 34a. Boundaries of the Land

The Lord speaks to Moses the boundaries of the land. The southern border is to go from the southern end of the Salt Sea (Dead Sea), south of Kadesh-barnea, to the Brook of Egypt, ending at the Mediterranean coast. The western border is the Great Sea (Mediterranean Sea). The northern border is to go from the Mediterranean coast as far north as Mount Hor (different Mount Hor in the north, not the one in Edom, also called Nur Mountains) to Zedad in the east. The eastern border is to go from Hazar-enan along the edge of the desert, to the Sea of Chinnereth (Sea of Galilee), along the Jordan, to the Salt Sea (Dead Sea).

## 34b. List of Tribal Chiefs

The Lord speaks to Moses the chiefs of each tribe who are to divide the land under the command of Eleazar and Joshua. The chiefs are Caleb (tribe of Judah), Shemual (tribe of Simeon), Elidad (tribe of Benjamin), Bukki (tribe of Dan), Hanniel (tribe of Manasseh), Kemuel (tribe of Ephraim), Elizaphan (tribe of Zebulun), Paltiel (tribe of Issachar), Ahihud (tribe of Asher), Pedahel (tribe of Naphtali). There are only 10 chiefs because the tribes of Reuben and Gad are settling in Transjordan.

## 35. Cities for the Levites

God speaks to Moses by the Jordan at Jericho and commands each of the tribes of Israel to give some of their land inheritance to the Levites as cities according to the size of the tribe. There will be 48 cities, 6 of which being cities of refuge. Those who commit murder may flee to a city of refuge to seek judgement from the congregation. If the murder was premeditated, or the murderer does not flee to a city of refuge, they are to be executed by the avenger, and no ransom is to be accepted for the life of the murderer. This must be backed by the evidence of more than one witness. If the murder was not premeditated, they are to remain in the city of refuge until the high priest dies. These laws prevent defiling the holy land in which God dwells because "no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it." (cf. Gen. 9:5).

## 36a. Marriage of Female Hiers

The people of the tribe of Manasseh come to Moses and the chiefs explaining that if a female heir marries outside of their tribe, they will lose their land inheritance to the husband. Moses takes the matter up with God and he commands that the women must marry within their tribe so as to not lose their God-given tribal land (Gen. 17:8).

## 36b. Conclusion

The book concludes by reminding the reader that these are the commandments the Lord commanded through Moses to the people of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. The conclusion implies that the new generation will be provided for in God's plan for his people, and that Moses will deliver his final words of wisdom and warning before his impending death.
