## Synopsis

Deuteronomy (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="devarim" text="Devarim"/>*, Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="deuteronomion" text="Deuteronomion"/>*). Before his impending death, Moses calls the next generation of Israel to be faithful to the covenant with God.

## Moses' First Speech

* * *

## 1. The Command to Leave Mt. Sinai

Moses recounts to all of Israel in the plains of Moab how the Lord commanded them to leave Mt. Sinai (Horeb) and take possession of Canaan to fulfill His covenant promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He recounts the appointment of tribal heads to help him judge and lead the people. He recounts how he told judges, "You shall not be partial in judgment…You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is God's." He recounts their journey through the wilderness to Kadesh where the 12 spies were sent to the Valley of Eshcol and came back with a bad report (about the Anakim – mighty men) which caused the people to rebel against God's commands to take the land, and ultimately prevented the entire generation (aside form Caleb and Joshua) form entering the land and allowed their children (who have no knowledge of good or evil) to enter. He recounts how they tried to enter the land without God's presence and were defeated and chased out, and finally returned to Kadesh.

## 2. The Defeat of King Sihon

Moses recounts to all of Israel how they traveled through the wilderness to Edom (Seir). He recounts through all their traveling, God continued to bless them. He recounts how they went on through the wilderness of Moab where God had dispossessed the Rephaim (also called Emim, Zamzummim, or Zuzim – mighty men who were tall like the Anakim), and continued on to the brook Zered (border between Edom and Moab). He recounts it is at this time that 38 years had passed and all of the older generation (except for Caleb and Joshua) had died. He then recounts that they crossed the border of Moab at Ar toward Ammon (where God had dispossessed the Rephaim), and continued on from the Valley of Arnon through wilderness of Kedemoth toward Heshbon. He recounts that they defeated Sihon, the king of Heshbon, at Jahaz and occupied the land. He recounts that God delivered them all the land from Aroer (northern bank of the Arnon) to Gilead (Transjordan).

## 3. The Defeat of King Og

Moses recounts to all of Israel how they went up and defeated Og, the king of Bashan (his bed of iron, or perhaps coffin, was 13 ft. long and 6 ft. wide), at Edrei and occupied the land. He recounts that God delivered them all the land of Bashan (Argob) from as far east as Salecah to as far north as Mount Hermon (Sirion / Senir), which means they occupied all the land from the Valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon (Transjordan). He recounts that he gave the land from Areor to Gilead to the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the land from Gilead to Bashan to the half-tribe of Manasseh. He recounts that while the land was given to the Transjordan tribes, they were to go and fight with the rest of Israel. He recounts how he told Joshua not to fear because "it is the Lord your God who fights for you." Moses recounts that he is to go to the Abarim (mountain range) to the top of Pisgah (northern part) to Mount Nebo (highest peak) to see the land, but not enter it, and to die, and has appointed Joshua as the new leader of Israel. He recounts that they remained in the valley opposite of Peor (Beth-peor).

## Moses' Second Speech

* * *

## 4. Moses Commands Obedience

Since Moses must die without crossing into the promised land (due to striking the rock – for which he blames the people of Israel), he calls the people of Israel to be faithful to God's commands so they may live and inherit the land God is giving them, and that these commands will be their wisdom and understanding, and that it is this righteousness that will set them apart. He reminds them how God destroyed those who worshiped Baal of Peor, while reminding them that there is no other god so close to his people. He reminds them of how God made himself known to the Israelites by speaking the commandments to them, and that when they heard the Lord speak, he had no form, therefore he warns them not to make any carved image of any earthly form – not to worship the things of this earth which God has created for them – and reminds them of the consequences. He also reminds them of God's character and how he is a merciful God, and that if they sin and repent, He will not leave them or forget them, and that He is the one true God. The section concludes with Moses setting apart three cities as cities of refuge (Bezer for the Reubenites, Ramoth for the Gadites, and Golan for the Manassites).

## 5. The Ten Commandments

Moses tells the new generation the Ten Commandments and reminds them it is a covenant they made with the Lord in Mt. Sinai, and how it was He who spoke the commandments to the people of Israel.

## 6. The Greatest Commandment

Moses delivers the Shema (a famous verse, translation: hear) to the new generation. "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates." He reminds them that when they are enjoying the abundance of the land the Lord is giving them, not to forget the Lord who brought them out of Egypt. He warns them not to test God like they did at Massah, shall keep His statutes, and shall teach of the Lord and their story throughout the generations.

## 7. A Chosen People

Moses tells the new generation to devote the people, idols, pillars, altars, etc. of Canaan to complete destruction. They shall not make a covenant with them, nor shall they intermarry, nor shall they pity them or serve their gods, lest they kindle the anger of the Lord. He reminds the Israelites they are a holy people chosen by God, not because they were numerous, but because they were loved, and because God made a covenant with their fathers. He warns them not to fall into the ways of the Cannanites because that would devote Israel to destruction like the other nations. God's plan is to drive the nations out little by little. He assures them that if they trust the Lord and follow His commands, they will be blessed and He will deliver these nations into their hands.

## 8. Remember the Lord Your God

Moses makes it clear that the forty years in the wilderness was not only a punishment, but a test. Moses commands the new generation of Israel to obey the Lord's commandments, lest they forget who brought them out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and to an abundant land where they will prosper. He warns them not to get so comfortable that they forget God and believe that it was their own hand that earned them this wealth and abundance. He warns them that if they forget God, don't obey His commands, or begin worshiping other gods, they will perish like the Canaanite nations before them. This implies that the land itself, like the wilderness, is also a test.

## 9. Not Because of Righteousness

Moses tells the new generation of Israel that they are about to cross over the Jordan and dispossess the Canaanites, and that God will deliver them into their hands, not because they have been righteous, but because the Canaanites have been wicked, and because God made a covenant with their fathers. Moses reminds them of their rebellion with the golden calf, and their rebellion throughout their journey through the wilderness, and recounts that he interceded for them on multiple accounts.

## 10a. New Tablets of Stone

Moses recounts how the Lord answers his intercession through the events that followed. God commanded Moses to make new tablets of stone which were put in the Ark of the Covenant, the people of Israel traveled to Mt. Hor where Aaron died and Eleazar became the new high priest, the Levites were set apart to carry the Ark of the Covenant and be under the care and provision of God (which is why they don't have a land inheritance), and Moses was given the command to continue on and lead the people into the promised land.

## 10b. Circumcise Your Heart

Moses tells the new generation of Israel that because the Lord has provided for them and has been so merciful, there is nothing more that they should do but to love and serve Him with all their hearts and to keep His statutes. He tells them "circumcise the foreskin of your heart," or in other words remove the stubbornness that prevents the heart from loving God (indicates a full transformation and commitment). He expresses that the Lord is the God of gods, the Lord of lords who is not only just, but looks out for the poor and the sojourner. Moses tells them to love the sojourner since they were sojourners in the land of Egypt. The section ends with Moses speaking the fulfillment of part of the Abrahamic promise, that they went down to Egypt as 70, and that God has made them "as numerous as the stars of the heaven."

## 11. Love and Serve the Lord

Moses addresses the adults of Israel who experienced the exodus and wilderness events and commands them to love the Lord and reminds them not only of the discipline God gave them, but how He destroyed the Egyptians who chased them to the Red Sea, and made the earth swallow up those who rebelled against Moses in the wilderness, and urges them to keep the Lord's statutes so that the land will be abundant and plentiful (implies similarities of Eden). He warns them that if they don't obey these commands or if they worship other gods, there will be no rain and the land will yield no fruit and they will perish quickly. Moses explains a ceremony where a blessing (if they obey the commandments) will be set on Mount Gerizim, and a curse (if they do not obey the commandments) will be set on Mount Ebal. These locations are near the oak of Moreh where God first promised Abraham the land, and will implicitly acknowledge fulfillment of that promise.

## Collection of Laws

* * *

## 12. The Lord's Chosen Place of Worship

Moses begins explaining the specific covenant stipulations, which follow the order of the Ten Commandments. He reminds the Israelites that they are to completely destroy the altars, pillars, carved images, Asherim (wooden poles featuring Ashera idols – Canaanite fertility goddess), and worship sites ("high places"), and not worship God in that way. They shall go to the place where God chooses as his habitation to bring their offerings, and that the laws of worship will be more strict in the land (they shall not simply do whatever is right in their own eyes). He highlights that worship is marked by rejoicing in response to grace and blessing, and that rejoicing includes servants and the Levites in their towns. He lets them know they are now able to eat non-sacrificial meat (both clean and unclean people) as much as they desire in the land since it will be abundant, and since there will be a central place of worship for sacrifices. Moses warns the people of Israel not to worship God the way the Canaanites did, since their practices were morally reprehensible and included things like child sacrifice by fire. He tells them to follow these commands and not add or take away from them.

## 13. Threats of Idolatry

If a pagan prophet attempts to persuade the people to worship other gods, it will be a test from God, and that person shall be killed. This law extends to even close friends or family members. If outsiders try to draw away Israelites to the cities to worship other gods, those cities shall be devoted to destruction. Hearsay must be checked carefully to ensure it is true and certain, not mere rumor. (Note, it is imperative that the Israelites not end up in the same situation the Canaanites are in, and that they take drastic measures to sacrifice the few for the good of the many, even if that means the death penalty. Remember, God is trying to bless all nations through Israel, and they need to protect their community, live by God's Word, and be set apart).

## 14a. Clean and Unclean Food

Moses commands the new generation not to participate in pagan mourning rituals (such as cutting themselves or shaving their heads) as they are a people holy to the Lord. He tells the laws for clean and unclean food, further underlining Israel's holiness. They can eat any animal that both parts the hoof and chews the cud. They can eat anything in the water that has fins and scales. They may eat all clean birds. They may not eat anything that has died naturally. They shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk (another pagan ritual of the time, and symbolically wrong).

## 14b. Tithes

Moses commands that 10% of all of their yearly yields be brought before the Lord in the place he is going to dwell. This not only demonstrates their devotion, it allows them to rejoice, and represents the faith that God will provide the other 90% and it will be sufficient. To make things easier if the place of worship is too far, they can convert the tithe into money to buy food or drink there. They are to not forget the Levites living in their towns. Every three years they are to give an extra tithe within their towns to the landless, the poor, and the sojourner so they may be blessed in the work that they do.

## 15. The Sabbatical Year

Moses tells the laws for the sabbatical year. Every seven years, every creditor is to release what he has lent to his neighbor, and every slave is to be released. They are to take care of the poor and give freely as there will never cease to be poor in the land. Slaves that are relased aren't to leave empty-handed for they too were slaves in the land of Egypt. If the slave wants to stay, their ear is to be pierced to signify permanent ownership. Moses stresses the importance of giving freely and avoiding greed. The firstborn males of the herd and flock shall be dedicated to the Lord (not only represents devotion, but represents trust in the Lord that they will be blessed with more to come). Blemished animals are to be eaten as a non-sacrificial meal.

## 16a. Feasts

When the Israelites enter the land, they are to celebrate the Passover at the place of worship where God chooses to dwell, and are to stay in tents close by for the seven-day celebration. The Feast of Weeks shall be celebrated seven weeks from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain (the end of the grain harvest). They shall make a freewill offering and rejoice and give thanks for the blessing of the harvest at the sanctuary, and remember they were slaves in Egypt and remember God's statutes. The Feast of Booths is to be celebrated after the harvest with seven days of rejoicing so that they may be blessed in their work. These three times a year all males are required to appear at the sanctuary with an offering according to the blessing God has given them.

## 16b. Justice

The Israelite are to appoint judges and officers according to their tribes to judge with righteous judgment and impartiality, accepting bribes from no one. Following justice will allow them to inherit the land God is giving them. Justice reflects God's character.

## 16c. No Other Gods Before Me

The Israelites are not to plant any tree as an Asherah pole (Asherah was a pagan fertility goddess), nor are they to set up any pillar to worship other gods.

## 17. Priests, Judges, and Kings

Blemished animals are not to be sacrificed to God. If there is evidence from more than one eyewitness account that someone broke the covenant, that person is to be executed. Complex legal matters are to be brought to the priests at the sanctuary for consideration, and the decision of the priests is not to be overruled under penalty of death. God anticipates Israel will elect a king, but knows kings are constantly tempted by abusing their power for their own personal gain. He explicitly warns against this and states that the king's laws shall be reviewed by the Levites as to not dethrone God and have his heart lifted above his brothers.

## 18. A New Prophet Like Moses

Moses reiterates that the Levites have no land inheritance, but rather eat the Lord's food offerings as the Lord is their inheritance. Priests can travel between the towns and the sanctuary to minister, and may sell their personal property to make money as they wish. Moses also reiterates Israel is not to follow the pagan practices of the Canaanites being driven out of the land, like child sacrifice by fire or necromancy. God anticipates a prophet rising up from amongst the people, and states that if the prophet speaks presumptuously, he shall die.

## 19. Laws Concerning Cities of Refuge

Three cities of refuge shall be established for each tribe. If God expands a tribal land, three additional cities of refuge shall be set up to account for the size of the land. The cities of refuge are places for someone who commits a murder that is not premeditated to flee to. If the murder was premeditated, they shall be prosecuted by the priests and handed over to the avenger of blood for execution. Again, more than one witness is needed to find someone guilty. If someone bears false witness against their neighbor, they shall do to him as he had meant to do to his brother (eye for an eye).

## 20. Laws Concerning Warfare

The Isrealites are not to fear their enemies, for God will be with them. Before battle, the priests are to speak to the people and remind them not to panic for God is with them. The officers are to send home those who have built new homes, are engaged, have planted a vineyard and need to harvest, or are fearful (fear is contagious in war). This implies that their services are not needed as even if their army is small, God is mightier than all their enemies. Additionally, this implies war is not seen as an end, but a means to ultimately protect and serve the community. Before battle, terms of peace should be offered. If the enemy accepts the terms, the enemy shall do forced labor. If they do not accept, all the men of the enemy shall be destroyed, but the women and children are to be captured. Note, these laws are for after Israel possesses the promised land as the Canaanites are to be devoted to complete destruction as previously mentioned. When a city is besieged, only the trees that are not for food may be destroyed as the ultimate end of the land is to be a fruitful garden for God's people.

## 21. Laws for Unsolved Murders

If someone is found murdered, the elders and judges are to bring the people of the nearest town to a valley with running water and break a heifer's neck. The people are to wash their hands over the heifer and testify they did not do it and accept atonement. Female captives are to be cleansed (head shaved, nails trimmed) and given a month to mourn before they may be married. If the man doesn't want to marry her after the month, he shall let her go respectfully and not treat her as a slave. Firstborn children are to be given a double portion of inheritance. If a son is out of control (for example he becomes a "glutton and a drunkard") and does not obey his parents nor accept their discipline, he is to be executed. If a man is hanged, he shall be buried the same day as a hanged man is cursed by God.

## 22. Laws Concerning Sexual Immorality

If one finds lost property, he is to hold onto it for his neighbor and to try and find the rightful owner. Transvestism is prohibited. In the same vein as the law about preserving trees, mother birds are not to be taken with their young. New houses shall have a parapet (protective wall) for its roof to safeguard people from falling. Different seeds, fabrics, and animals shall not be mixed together (reminding them of God's ordering of creation "according to its kind", and reminding them God has separated them from other peoples to be distinct and holy). The law about tassels is reiterated here (blue tassels – blue represents God's divinity – on the corners of one's garments reminds one to follow the commandments of the Lord and not one's own eyes and heart, which one is inclined to do). If a man accuses his wife of adultery, the case shall be brought to the elders. If the woman is falsely accused, the man is punished (whipped and fined), and may not divorce her. If she is found guilty, she is executed. Adulterers shall be executed. If an unmarried man sleeps with a woman, he is to pay a bride-price to the father and marry her. A man may not take his stepmother from his father.

## 23. Those Excluded from the Assembly

Men who have been castrated as a result of pagan worship, those who have been born of a forbidden union, and any Ammonite or Moabite shall not be allowed to enter the assembly of the Lord (Israel's worship at the place the Lord chooses). Edomites (because they are Israel's brother) and Egyptians (because they were sojourners in their land) shall not be abhorred. When camping against enemies, the Israelites are to keep the camp clean, which includes covering up their excrement. Refugee slaves are to be taken in and are not to be wronged. Prostitution is forbidden along with giving money earned from prostitution as a vow. Charging interest on a loan to your brother is forbidden. Vows are voluntary, but must be fulfilled once made (a promise to the Lord must be kept just as His promises are kept to us). You may eat of your neighbor's crops, but you may not harvest them and put them in your bag (this is most likely to protect the poor who may need food and promotes generosity, but does not condone stealing).

## 24. Laws Concerning Divorce

If a woman gets married, gets divorced, and remarries, the original husband cannot remarry her (this is most likely to prevent the husband from receiving a second dowry from the woman's father). Newly married men shall not go to war. Neither a poor person's mill nor his blanket be taken as a security for a loan since it would leave them without a way to grind grain or sleep at night. One may not enter someone's home to collect a loan. Kidnapping gets the death penalty. The people must heed the Levites instructions regarding leprosy. A hired worker shall not be oppressed and shall be paid the same day. Fathers may not be put to death because of their children or vice versa. One may not take advantage of a sojourner or a poor person, and extra food from the fields shall be left for the poor and the sojourner.

## 25. Laws Concerning Levirate Marriage

Flogging is limited to 40 lashes. Oxen were not to be muzzled in the fields (even they were entitled to the food in the fields). If a woman's husband dies childless, his brother should assume his role as husband. If he refuses, the elders shall talk to him. If he still refuses he is publicly humiliated (the woman takes off his sandal, spits in his face, and his house is called "the house of him who had his sandal pulled off"). If men are fighting and a wife grabs a man's genitals to save her husband, her hand is to be cut off (this barbaric law is most likely an attempt to protect a man's ability to procreate much like the previous law protects women). You are not to deceive people by falsifying measurements (for example when weighing food to buy or sell). Because the Amalekites attacked Israel, they should be blotted out.

## 26. Offerings of Firstfruits and Tithes

When Israel arrives in the promised land, they are to take their firstfruits to the sanctuary as an offering and a means of rejoicing, and are to acknowledge their history as people who were delivered from slavery in Egypt to the promised land by God. After their tithe in the third year to the Levite, the poor, and the sojourner, they are to say a blessing before God that acknowledges they've done so under the statues of the law. The section concludes with Moses declaring that the people of Israel have accepted these commandments, and that they are a people holy to the Lord.

## Moses' Final Speech

* * *

## 27. The Altar of Mount Ebal

Moses and the elders command the people to build an altar with these laws on Mount Ebal and shall offer and rejoice there. Six tribes (Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin) shall stand on Mount Gerizim for the blessing, and the other six tribes (Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali) shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse. The Levites are to declare a curse to all who break the Lord's commandments, and all the people are to answer and say, "Amen." Cursed be anyone who does the following: makes a carved image, dishonors his mother and father, moves his neighbor's landmark, misleads a blind man, takes advantage of the poor, lies with his mother-in-law, his sister, or an animal, commits murder, takes a bribe to shed innocent blood (foreshadows Jesus), breaks the law.

## 28. Blessings for Obedience

Moses and the elders give blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. If Israel is faithful, they will be blessed, fruitful, have abundance in the land, and be a people holy to God. They will be the "head not the tail." If they disobey, they will be cursed, hungry (to the point of cannibalism), confused, frustrated, sick, oppressed, helpless, and will ultimately be defeated, overtaken, and exiled from the land. They will be the "tail not the head."

## 29. The Covenant Renewed in Moab

Moses renews the covenant with the new generation of Israel in Moab. Moses recounts how although God delivered them from Egypt, they remained stubborn. He says, "The Lord has not given you a heart to understand or eyes to see or ears to hear." Despite their stubbornness, they defeated Sihon and Og and possessed the land, therefore, they must keep the covenant so they may prosper. Moses reaffirms God's promise to their fathers, and warns them of turning away from God when they enter the land, lest their name be blotted out. The section concludes with Moses stating that not all that is true about God has been revealed, but that which has been revealed belongs to them and their children and shall be obeyed.

## 30. Repentance and Forgiveness

Moses tells the people that if they disobey and repent, that God will have mercy on them, restore their fortunes, and circumcise their hearts and the hearts of their children. He tells them that the commandments are not out of reach for them, they are right at their level. He says that life and death, good and evil, are before them, all they have to do is choose life and love God so they can fulfill God's promise to their fathers lest they fall into darkness and perish.

## 31. Joshua to Succeed Moses

Moses tells the people Joshua is to succeed him and not to fear because God is on their side. He calls Joshua up before all the people and tells him to be strong and courageous, and that he shall lead the people into the promised land, and that God will be with them. Moses gives the law to the priests and tells them to read it to the people every seven years in the year of release at the Feast of Booths. Moses and Joshua go to the tabernacle and the cloud of God stands over it. God tells Mose he is about to die, and that the people will once again rebel and evil will come upon them. God tells Moses to write a song about it and to teach it to the people. God commissions Joshua to lead the people into the promised land, and tells him He will be with him. Moses has the Levites put the book of the law next to the Ark of the Covenant. He expresses his concerns that they have been stubborn during his life, and asks how much more stubborn they will be after his death. Moses is sure that evil will befall them.

## 32. The Song of Moses

Moses speaks his song to the people. The song opens with a prayer to God that the people hear his teachings and hear of God's glory. Moses calls God "The Rock", and acknowledges his goodness and faithfulness. He says that Israel is a "crooked and twisted" generation who will forget the God who created them, protected them, fed them, and gave them the land. He calls for Israel to remember how in the midst of their suffering, God enriched them, cared for them, and kept them as "the apple of His eye." He sings of how God truly provided for Israel, and how they enjoyed His many blessings. He describes how Israel turned away from God, worshiped other gods, and provoked Him to anger, which resulted in disaster. He expresses that beyond defeat and exile, God will restore His people. The song ends with a call for all to rejoice with Him as He will restore and bless all nations. Moses asks the people to take to heart the words he is telling them and to teach them to their children, for their life depends on it. God tells  Moses to go to Mount Nebo to see the land of Canaan, but not enter it, and to die for his sin at Meribah-kadesh. (Note: Jeshurun means the upright one, a poetic name for Israel.)

## 33. Moses' Final Blessing on Israel

Like a patriarch (e.g. Jacob), Moses blesses Israel before his death. He begins by describing how Israel is a nation loved by God, and that He is their king. He says Reuben will be few, God will fight for Judah, Levi will teach the law and oversee the sacrificial system, Benjamin will be safe in the presence of God, Joseph will have abundance and will be a prince among his brothers, Zebulun in their going out and Issachar in their tents shall have abundance from the seas and sands, Gad is like a lion fighting for the Lord and Israel and chose the best land, Dan is like a lion's cub that leaps to the north, Naphtali possesses the lake and the south, Asher will be wealthy and will be the favorite among his brothers, Simeon is not mentioned. He concludes by saying there is none like Israel who dwells with God and is protected by His shield.

## 34. The Death of Moses

Moses goes from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo on the top of Pisgah and sees the promised land. God tells him this is the land that he promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that the land will be given to his offspring, but that he is not to go in. Moses dies at 120 years old, full of vigor and is buried by the Lord somewhere in Moab opposite Beth-peor (exact location unknown). The people weep for 30 days. Joshua, filled with the spirit of wisdom, takes the lead and the people obey him as the Lord commanded Moses. Not a prophet like Moses whom the Lord knew face to face arises among Israel.
