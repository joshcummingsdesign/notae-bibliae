<Definition lang="greek" anchor="koine" text="Koine"/> Greek evolved from the spread of Greek following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, and served as the lingua franca of much of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East during the following centuries. Alexander the Greatâ€™s men spoke many dialects, so a common language was needed.
