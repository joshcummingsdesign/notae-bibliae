<Initial text="Tyndale Bible" />

William Tyndale was a 16th-century English Bible scholar who, influenced by humanism, believed that all believers should have access to the Bible in their own language. After studying at Oxford and Cambridge, he began translating the Greek New Testament into English in 1523, using the [Textus Receptus](/bible/translations/textus-receptus). Facing opposition from church authorities in England, he moved to Cologne in 1524, where he received financial support and published his first New Testament translation in 1525. He later moved to Worms, where he published additional editions. Tyndale also worked on translating the Hebrew Old Testament using the [Masoretic Text](/bible/translations/masoretic-text), with the Pentateuch being published in 1530. However, before completing the full Old Testament, he was captured by the Inquisition, imprisoned, and tried for heresy, particularly his stance on justification by faith. In 1536, he was strangled to death and burned at the stake. His last words were "Lord! Open the King of England's eyes."

Though incomplete, the Tyndale Bible is credited with being the first Bible translation in the English language to work directly from Hebrew and Greek texts. Tyndale did, however, use the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate) and the [Luther Bible](/bible/translations/luther-bible) as resources. He used formal equivalence (word-for-word translation).
