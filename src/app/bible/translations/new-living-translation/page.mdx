<Initial text="New Living Translation"/>

Inspired by [The Living Bible](/bible/translations/the-living-bible), a team of 93 scholars set out to make an easy-to-read bible in 1996. Its textual basis for the New Testament was the [Novum Testamentum Graece](/bible/translations/novum-testamentum-graece), and for the Old Testament was the [Masoretic Text](/bible/translations/masoretic-text). It uses dynamic equivalence (thought-for-thought translation). There is also a Catholic edition which was published in 2015.
