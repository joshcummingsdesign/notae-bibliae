<Initial text="Targum Jonathan" />

Targum (תַּרְגּוּם) is Aramaic for "interpretation", "translation", or "version". A targum is an Aramaic paraphrase of the Hebrew Bible. An Aramaic paraphrase was necessary near the end of the 1st century BC, as Aramaic became the common language. It was initially an oral tradition, but written targums began to appear as early as the 1st century AD, though none of them were authoritative.

The Targum Jonathan is the oldest and most authoritative Aramaic translation of the [Nevi'im](/bible/old-testament/jewish-order/neviim). It was first compiled in the 2nd century AD, and has been used as the standard Aramaic translation ever since. It is attributed to Jonathan ben Uzziel, a famous rabbinic sage.
