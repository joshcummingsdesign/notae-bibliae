<Initial text="American Standard Version" />

Published in 1901, a team of 30 American Protestant scholars from many denominations, led by Protestant theologian Philip Schaff, set out to make a modern English translation that was more understandable for modern readers than the [King James Version](/bible/translations/king-james-version). It retained Elizabethan English and was perceived as excessively literal, and never gained much popularity outside of some Protestant seminaries. It used the [Westcott and Hort](/bible/translations/westcott-and-hort) and [Masoretic Text](/bible/translations/masoretic-text) for its textual basis, and also had some [Septuagint](/bible/translations/septuagint) influence.
