<Initial text="Masoretic Text"/>

Based on the Masora, the textual tradition of Jewish scholars known as the Masoretes. The Masoretes made it their special work to correct faults that had crept into the [Tanakh](/bible/old-testament/jewish-order) during the Babylonian captivity, and organize the books of the Jewish canon. Oldest fragments date back to 9th century AD. The oldest-known complete copy is the Leningrad Codex (11th century), so named because it has been housed in Saint Petersburg, Russia (formerly Leningrad). A codex was an ancient book bound at its side as opposed to a scroll.
