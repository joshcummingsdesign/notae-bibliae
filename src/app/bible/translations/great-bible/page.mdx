The first authorized edition of the Bible in English, commissioned by Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to King Henry VIII, in 1539 for use in the Church of England. It was prepared by Myles Coverdale, and was largely a revision of the [Coverdale Bible](/bible/translations/coverdale-bible), meant to be read aloud in the Church of England.
