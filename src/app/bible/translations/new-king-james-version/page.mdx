<Initial text="New King James Version"/>

In 1975, British American publishing house Thomas Nelson set out to make a modern English translation of the Bible that was faithful to the original [King James Version](/bible/translations/king-james-version). A team of 130 Greek, Hebrew, and English scholars, editors, church leaders, and Christian laity were involved in its translation. The text for the New Testament was published in 1979; the Psalms in 1980; and the full Bible in 1982. The project took seven years in total to complete.
