<Initial text="English Standard Version" />

In the 1990s, American publishing house Crossway set out to make a translation of the Bible that adhered to an essentially literal translation philosophy, taking into account differences in grammar, syntax, and idiom between current literary English and the original languages. It was translated by a team of over 100 evangelical scholars, and was published in 2001. Its textual basis for the New Testament was the [Novum Testamentum Graece](/bible/translations/novum-testamentum-graece); for the Old Testament was the [Masoretic Text](/bible/translations/masoretic-text); and for the Apocrypha was the [Septuagint](/bible/translations/septuagint) and the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate). It uses formal equivalence (word-for-word translation). There is also a Catholic edition which was published in 2017.
