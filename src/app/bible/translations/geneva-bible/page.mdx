<Initial text="Geneva Bible"/>

Named after the city of Geneva, Switzerland, where it was first printed in 1560. The translation was primarily done by English Protestant exiles who had fled to Geneva to escape religious persecution under the reign of Queen Mary I of England. It became the primary Bible of English Protestantism. It was the first mass-produced Bible with study guides. Its translation was led by a team of Calvinist theologians, which made it unpopular among the leaders of the Church of England and King James VI and I. While it used the [Masoretic Text](/bible/translations/masoretic-text) and the [Textus Receptus](/bible/translations/textus-receptus) as its textual basis, it also used the [Tyndale Bible](/bible/translations/tyndale-bible) and [Coverdale Bible](/bible/translations/coverdale-bible) as resources.
