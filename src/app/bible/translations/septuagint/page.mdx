<Initial text="Septuagint"/>

Sometimes referred to as the Greek Old Testament. The name comes from the Latin <Definition lang="latin" anchor="septuaginta" text="Septuaginta" /> which means "The Seventy", so named because of the seventy translators who translated the Hebrew and Aramaic text to Koine Greek in 3rd century BC. It is sometimes abbreviated as LXX. It was the first major effort in translating the Bible. According to legend, 72 Jewish scholars—six scholars from each of the twelve tribes of Israel—were asked by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Greek Pharaoh of Egypt, to translate the Hebrew Bible from Biblical Hebrew to Koine Greek for inclusion in the Library of Alexandria.
