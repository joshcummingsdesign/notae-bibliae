<Initial text="Coverdale Bible"/>

The Coverdale Bible was compiled by Myles Coverdale, priest in the Church of England who was consecrated by Thomas Cranmer, leader of the English Reformation. Published in 1535, it was the first complete Modern English translation of the Bible. Coverdale's work was largely based on the [Tyndale Bible](/bible/translations/tyndale-bible), though he also used the [Luther Bible](/bible/translations/luther-bible) and the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate) as resources.
