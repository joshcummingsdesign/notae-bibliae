<Initial text="Wycliffe's Bible"/>

John Wycliffe was a 14th-century English Catholic priest and theologian. Wycliffe advocated for biblical literacy and public preaching, and in around 1380, he led the translation of the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate) into Middle English using formal equivalence (word-for-word translation).

Wycliffe rejected overreaching papal authority, transubstantiation, and the necessity of the sacrament of Confession. His followers were called by their persecutors "the Lollards", which comes from a Middle Dutch word that means "to mumble". Wycliffe died of a stroke in 1348. After his death, the Roman Catholic Church deemed him to be heretical, and ordered all his writings to be burned.
