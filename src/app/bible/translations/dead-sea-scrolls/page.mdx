<Initial text="Dead Sea Scrolls" />

The Dead Sea Scrolls, which were written between the 3rd century BC and the 1st century AD, were discovered in 1946 at the Qumran Caves (Judean Desert, on the northern shore of the Dead Sea). A shepherd following a goat that had gone astray tossed a rock into one of the caves along the sea cliffs and heard a cracking sound. The rock hit a ceramic pot containing 7 scrolls, later determined to be nearly twenty centuries old. After ten years, scrolls were found in 11 caves around the Dead Sea, representing an estimated 800 separate works. The Dead Sea Scrolls give us confidence in the reliability of the Old Testament manuscripts, since minimal differences were found between versions.
