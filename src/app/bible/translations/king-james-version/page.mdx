<Initial text="King James Version"/>

As the [Geneva Bible](/bible/translations/geneva-bible) grew in popularity in the Church of England, it became a concern for King James VI and I (Scotland and England and Ireland respectively), who deemed the Calvinist translators too radical. In 1604, James convened the Hampton Court Conference to create a new translation, ensuring it aligned with the Church of England's structure and beliefs. The result was the King James Version, which was published in 1611. It became the standard English translation by the 18th century, replacing the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate) and the [Great Bible](/bible/translations/great-bible) in many contexts. By the 19th century, the King James Version became the most widely printed book in history. Its translation involved 47 scholars. The source material for the translation of the New Testament was the [Textus Receptus](/bible/translations/textus-receptus); for the Old Testament, the [Masoretic Text](/bible/translations/masoretic-text); for some of the apocrypha, the [Septuagint](/bible/translations/septuagint) was used, and for the apocrypha for which the Greek was unavailable, the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate) was used. It used a balance between formal equivalence (word-for-word translation) and dynamic equivalence (though-for-thought translation).
