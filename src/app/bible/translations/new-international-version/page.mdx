<Initial text="New International Version"/>

Published in 1978, a team of 15 scholars set out to make a modern English translation that was more understandable for modern readers than the [King James Version](/bible/translations/king-james-version). Translation took 10 years and involved over 100 scholars from around the English-speaking world and of many Protestant denominations. Its textual basis for the New Testament was the [Novum Testamentum Graece](/bible/translations/novum-testamentum-graece), and for the Old Testament was the [Masoretic Text](/bible/translations/masoretic-text). It used both formal equivalence (word-for-word translation) and dynamic equivalence (thought-for-thought translation), though leaning more towards the latter.
