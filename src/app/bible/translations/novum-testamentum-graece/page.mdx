<Initial text="Novum Testamentum Graece" />

The first edition of the Novum Testamentum Graece (Latin: "The New Testament in Greek") was published in 1898 by Eberhard Nestle. Nestle was a German scholar who aimed to create a critical edition of the Greek New Testament that would reflect the most reliable textual readings based on the available ancient manuscripts. Eberhard's son Erwin Nestle took over after his father's death and issued the 13th edition in 1927. Kurt Aland became the associate editor of the 21st edition in 1952. The 28th edition was published in 2012, and named the Nestle-Aland (NA) edition. This version went on to become one of the most widely-accepted critical texts of the Greek New Testament.
