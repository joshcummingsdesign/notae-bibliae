<Initial text="Textus Receptus"/>

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="textus-receptus" text="Textus Receptus" /> is a term used to describe the Greek text of the New Testament that was first compiled and published in the 16th century, beginning with the work of the Dutch theologian and Catholic priest Erasmus in 1516. It was based on a limited number of Greek manuscripts that Erasmus had access to at the time, along with some back-translations from the Latin when parts of the Greek text were missing. Despite these limitations, it became the standard Greek text used across much of Europe for centuries. Later editors, including Robert Estienne (also known as Stephanus) and the Elzevir brothers, made revisions and republished it, but the core text remained largely the same. The name "Textus Receptus" was popularized in 1633 when the Elzevir brothers published an edition which included a preface stating that it was "the text now received by all."
