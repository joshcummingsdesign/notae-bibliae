In 382 AD, [Pope St. Damasus I](/people/saints/latin-fathers/damasus-of-rome) commissioned [St. Jerome](/people/saints/latin-fathers/jerome-of-stridon) to begin a revision of the [Vetus Latina](/bible/translations/vetus-latina). Jerome completed his translation work by 405 AD, which later came to be known as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="biblia-vulgata" text="Vulgate" />.
