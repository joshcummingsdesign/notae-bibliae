In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in Germany. In 1521, Martin Luther was ordered by Roman emperor Charles V to appear before the Diet of Worms. Fearing for Luther's safety, Prince Frederick III hid Luther at his castle in Wartburg where Luther translated the Greek New Testament into German. Luther used the [Textus Receptus](/bible/translations/textus-receptus) as well as the [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate) in his translation. In 1522, the Luther Bible was printed. Luther used dynamic equivalence (thought-for-thought translation).
