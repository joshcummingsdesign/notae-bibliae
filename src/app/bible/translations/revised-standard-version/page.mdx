<Initial text="Revised Standard Version"/>

Published 1952, the National Council of the Churches (NCC), an ecumenical partnership of 38 Christian faith groups in the United States, set off to revise the [American Standard Version](/bible/translations/american-standard-version), and make a more readable and literally accurate modern English translation. It was the first translation of the Bible to make use of the [Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah](/bible/translations/dead-sea-scrolls). Its textual basis for the New Testament was the [Novum Testamentum Graece](/bible/translations/novum-testamentum-graece); for the Old Testament was the [Masoretic Text](/bible/translations/masoretic-text); and for the Apocrypha was the [Septuagint](/bible/translations/septuagint) with some [Vulgate](/bible/translations/vulgate) influence. It used formal equivalence (word-for-word translation). There is also a Catholic edition which was published in 1965.
