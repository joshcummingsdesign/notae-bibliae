## Synopsis

The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew is a 7th-century adaptation of the Gospel of James written in Latin and circulated under the name of [St. Matthew](/people/saints/apostles/matthew). Though apocryphal, it is useful for instruction.

The book begins with an apocryphal letter between Jerome and two bishops in which they ask Jerome to translate the text from Hebrew to Latin. Jerome agrees, but warns them to read the text with discernment and caution. The book then continues to tell the story of the Nativity of [St. Mary](/people/saints/biblical/mary).

## Joachim and Anne

[Joachim](/glossary/names#joachim) was a man from the tribe of Judah who lived in Jerusalem and feared the Lord with all his heart. At the age of 15, he became a shepherd. Whatever he possessed, he divided into three portions: one he gave to the orphans, the widows, the strangers, and the poor; the second to those who worshipped God; and the third he kept for himself and all his house. The Lord raised him up so that there was no one like him in all Israel.

At the age of 20, Joachim took [Anne](/glossary/names#anne) the daughter of Achar of the house of Judah to be his wife. They lived together for 20 years, but Anne remained barren. Anne vowed that if the Lord would give her a child, she would give the child over to the Lord in his holy temple. The priest Reuben, however, saw Joachim and Anne's childlessness as a sign of divine disapproval, and sent Joachim away from the temple when he came to offer sacrifices. Joachim wept and fled to the mountains, and was not seen again for five months.

## An Angel Appears to Anne

Anne wept and prayed with tears saying, "O Lord, most mighty God of Israel, why have you, seeing that already you have not given me children, taken from me my husband also? Behold, I have not seen my husband in five months, and I know not where he is. And if I knew him to be dead, I could I not bury him." She raised her eyes and saw a sparrow (cf. Ps. 84:2-4) in a laurel tree (sign of victory and honor). She groaned to the Lord that all the creatures of the earth seemed to have been blessed with offspring except her.

Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared before her, saying, "Be not afraid, Anne, for a child has been decreed for you by God. And all generations, even to the end, shall marvel at the one born of you." Then he vanished out of her sight. She lay in bed in fear for a whole day and night. When she cried out for help, her maidservant said to her, "If God has shut up your womb and has taken away your husband from you, what can I do for you?" And when Anne heard this, she lifted up her voice, and wept aloud.

## The Angel Appears to Joachim

The day of the angel's appearing to Anne, while Joachim was feeding his flocks in the mountains, a young man appeared to him and said, "Why do you not return to your wife?" And Joachim said, "I have had her for 20 years, and it has not been the will of God to give me children by her. I have been driven with shame and reproach from the temple of the Lord. Why should I go back to her, when I have been once cast off and utterly despised? Here then will I remain with my sheep, and so long as in this life God is willing to grant me light, I shall willingly, by the hands of my servants, bestow their portions upon the poor, and the orphans, and those who fear God."

The young man then said to him, "I am an angel of the Lord, and I have today appeared to your wife when she was weeping and praying, and have consoled her. She has conceived a daughter by you, who will be in the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit shall abide in her, and her blessedness shall be greater than that of all the holy women, so that no one can say that any before her or after her has been like her. You in your ignorance have left your wife, therefore, go down from the mountains and return to her, and you will find her with child. For God has raised up a child in her, and for this you will give God thanks. For your wife has been blessed, and her child shall be blessed and shall be made the mother of eternal blessing."

## Joachim Instructed to Make a Burnt Offering

Then Joachim adored the angel, and said to him, "If I have found favor in your sight, sit for a little in my tent, and bless your servant." And the angel said to him, "Do not say servant, but fellow-servant, for we are the servants of one Master. But my food is invisible, and my drink cannot be seen by a mortal. Therefore, you ought not to ask me to enter your tent, but if you would give me anything, let it be a burnt offering unto the Lord." Then Joachim took a lamb without spot, and said to the angel, "I dare not offer a burnt offering to the Lord, unless your command had given me the priest's right of offering" (cf. Num. 3:10). And the angel said to him, "I would not have invited you to make an offering unless I had known the will of the Lord." And when Joachim was offering the sacrifice to God, both the angel and the aroma of the sacrifice went up together to heaven with the smoke.

## Joachim Instructed to Return to Anne

Joachim threw himself on his face and lay in prayer from the sixth hour of the day until evening. His servants, who were with him, thought that he was dead. They came to him, and raised him up from the ground. When he recounted to them the vision of the angel, they were struck with great fear and wonder, and advised him to accomplish the vision of the angel without delay, and to go back with all haste to his wife.

As Joachim was turning over in his mind whether he should go back or not, he fell into a deep sleep, and behold, the angel appeared to him saying, "I am the angel appointed by God as your guardian. Go down with confidence, and return to Anne, because the deeds of mercy which you and your wife have done have been told in the presence of the Most High. And to you will God give such fruit as no prophet or saint has ever had from the beginning, or ever will have. And when Joachim awoke out of his sleep, he called all his servants to him, and told them his dream. They worshipped the Lord, and said to Joachim, "See that you no further despise the words of the angel. But rise and let us go hence."

## Joachim and Anne Reunited

After 30 days, Joachim and his servants drew near to the place where Anne was, and behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Anne, who was standing and praying, and said, "Go to the gate which is called Golden, and meet your husband in the way, for today he will come to you." She went towards him in haste with her maidservants, and praying to the Lord, she stood a long time in the gate waiting for him. When she grew weary from waiting, she lifted up her eyes and saw Joachim from afar coming with his flocks. She ran to him and hung on his neck, giving thanks to God, saying, "I was a widow, and behold now I am not so. I was barren, and behold I have now conceived." And so they worshipped the Lord, and went into their house. And when this was heard of, there was great joy among all their neighbors and acquaintances, so that the whole land of Israel congratulated them. After these things, her nine months being fulfilled, Anna brought forth a daughter, and called her **Mary**.
