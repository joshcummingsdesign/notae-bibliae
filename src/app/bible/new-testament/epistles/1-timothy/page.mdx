## Synopsis

During [St. Paul's](/people/saints/paul) second mission, he meets [St. Timothy](/people/saints/timothy) in Lystra (in Galatia) (Acts 16:1). Impressed by his passion and devotion to Jesus, Paul began sending him on missions to different churches. In around 62–64 AD, Paul was released from prison in Rome and carried on further mission work. During this time, he got word that issues arose in the church in Ephesus (western Asia Minor), namely false teaching. Paul sent Timothy to confront the church leaders in Ephesus and restore order to the church. After Timothy arrived in Ephesus, Paul sent him this letter (most likely from Macedonia) to follow up and instruct him on how to fulfill this mission.
