## Synopsis

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) second letter he wrote from Corinth to the Thessalonians (from Thessalonica in Macedonia, modern northern Greece) in around 49–51 AD. Paul receives a report that the persecution in Thessalonica is worsening, and that the church there is confused about the return of Jesus. In this letter, Paul offers a message of hope in the face of persecution, clarity about the coming Day of the Lord, and a challenge to the idle (people unwilling to work normal jobs).
