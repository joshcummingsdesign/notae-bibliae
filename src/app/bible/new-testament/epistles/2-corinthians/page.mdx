## Synopsis

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) second letter to the Corinthians (from Corinth, a major port city in Achaia, modern southern Greece) which he wrote from Macedonia in around 55–56 AD. After Paul's first letter addressing the issues in the church in Corinth, the Corinthians continued to rebel against his leadership. Paul has a painful visit to the church in Corinth, and then follows up with a letter of anguish and tears. Most of the Corinthians recognize their arrogance and look to reconcile with Paul. Paul then writes this letter to assure them of his love and commitment.
