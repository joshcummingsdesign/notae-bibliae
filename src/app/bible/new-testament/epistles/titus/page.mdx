## Synopsis

[St. Titus](/people/saints/biblical/titus) was a Greek follower of Jesus and traveling companion of [St. Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul) (Gal. 2:1) (2 Cor. 8:23). In around 62–64 AD, Paul was released from prison in Rome and carried on further mission work. Paul sent Titus on a mission to Crete (a large island off the coast of Greece) to restore order to a network of house churches. Cretan culture was notorious for treachery and greed, and most of the men on the island served as mercenary soldiers to the highest bidder. The islands cities were known for being unsafe and plagued by violence and sexual corruption. The island did, however, have many strategic harbors which serviced cities all over the Mediterranean Sea, which made it ideal for establishing a network of churches. These churches came under the influence of corrupt Cretan leaders, so Paul sent this letter to Titus from Nicopolis (in Epirus, modern western Greece) to instruct him on how to restore order.
