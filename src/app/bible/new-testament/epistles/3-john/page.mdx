## Synopsis

[St. John's](/people/saints/apostles/john) third letter which he wrote to Gaius, a member of a house church in Ephesus, in around 85–95 AD. The church communities in Ephesus had recently gone through a crisis involving a group of people who broke away from the Church, denied Jesus, and stirred up hostility among those who remained faithful. The leader of this house church, Diotrephes, opposed John, so John wrote this letter to ask Gaius to welcome missionaries who would soon arrive.
