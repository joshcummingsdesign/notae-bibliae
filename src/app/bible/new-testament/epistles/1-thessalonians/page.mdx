## Synopsis

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) first letter he wrote from Corinth to the Thessalonians (from Thessalonica in Macedonia, modern northern Greece) in around 49–51 AD, St. Paul and [St. Silas](/people/saints/biblical/silas) establish a church in Thessalonica, but some of the Jews there form a mob and report the Christians to the authorities, claiming that Jesus' authority undermines the authority of Roman emperor Claudius Caesar. Paul and Silas are forced to flee the city, but they receive a report from [St. Timothy](/people/saints/biblical/timothy) that the Thessalonians begin to flourish despite the intense persecution. Paul's message to them is about holiness, love, and future hope.
