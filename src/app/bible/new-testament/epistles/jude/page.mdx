## Synopsis

A letter from [St. Jude](/people/saints/jude/)—apostle, cousin of Jesus, and brother of [St. James the Less](/people/saints/james-the-less)—addressed to the Messianic Jews in or around Egypt, Asia Minor, and Syrian Antioch in the mid 60s AD. False teaching and moral compromise were creeping into the church, and Jude writes to show that God's grace demands a whole-life response not just an intellectual one, and that believing is not just about what you say, but what you do.
