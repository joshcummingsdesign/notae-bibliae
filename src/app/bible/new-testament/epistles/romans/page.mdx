## Synopsis

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) letter to the Romans which he wrote from Corinth in 57 AD. It is one of Paul's longest and most significant writings. Five years after Roman emperor Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome, they were allowed to return. This caused tension because the church in Rome had become divided amongst Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus. Rome was an important church because it would serve as a staging ground for Paul's mission to Spain. Thus, Paul wrote this letter as an attempt to both unify the church and give his fullest explanation of the gospel, the good news about Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.
