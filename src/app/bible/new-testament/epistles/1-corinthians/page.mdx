## Synopsis

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) first letter to the Corinthians (from Corinth, a major port city in Achaia, modern southern Greece) which he wrote from Ephesus in around 53–55 AD. Paul got word that things were not going well within the church in Corinth. This letter addresses the five main problems of the church, division, sexual immorality, the question of eating food sacrificed to idols, disorderly gatherings, and confusion about the Resurrection.
