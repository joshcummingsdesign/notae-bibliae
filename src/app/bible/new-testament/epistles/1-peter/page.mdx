## Synopsis

[St. Peter's](/people/saints/peter) first letter to the churches in the Roman provinces in Asia Minor (Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Bithynia) which he wrote in Rome, which he calls Babylon, in around 62–63 AD. It was composed and delivered by [St. Silas](/people/saints/silas) (Silvanus). The churches in Asia Minor were facing hostility and persecution, and Peter wrote this letter to encourage them in the midst of their suffering. Peter's letter affirms the Church's new family identity, and shows that suffering is both a way to bear witness to Jesus and to focus our future hope on Jesus' return.
