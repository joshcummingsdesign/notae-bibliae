## Synopsis

A letter from [St. James the Less](/people/saints/james-the-less)—apostle, cousin of Jesus, and church leader in Jerusalem—addressed to the Messianic Jews in and around Palestine around 40–45 AD, in which he offers wisdom on serving the Lord and describes the works that proceed from faith.
