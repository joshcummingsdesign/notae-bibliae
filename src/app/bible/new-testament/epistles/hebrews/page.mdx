## Synopsis

A letter from an unknown author—traditionally attributed to [St. Paul](/people/saints/paul)—to the Messianic Jews in Rome or in or near Palestine in around 60–70 AD. The church community was facing persecution and imprisonment because of their association with Jesus, which was causing many to abandon their faith, and this letter is a response to the church community, urging them to stay faithful.
