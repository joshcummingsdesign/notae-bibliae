<Initial text="Galatians"/>

A letter [St. Paul](/people/saints/paul) wrote from Antioch to the churches in south Galatia (modern central Turkey) in 48 AD. The gospel was spreading to the Gentiles and crossing cultural lines, and the Messianic Jews believed circumcision was necessary for salvation. In this letter, Paul looks to both address this false teaching, and explore how Jesus fulfilled the laws of the Torah and gave us freedom through the Holy Spirit.
