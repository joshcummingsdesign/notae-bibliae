## Synopsis

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) letter to the Philippians (from Philippi, eastern Macedonia) which he wrote while imprisoned in Rome in 62 AD. The church at Philippi was the first church Paul founded in Europe. Philippi was also where St. Paul and [St. Silas](/people/saints/silas) were imprisoned for casting a demon out of a fortune teller (Acts 16:16). Philippi was full of retired soldiers and was known for its patriotic nationalism. Because of this, Paul faced much resistance when proclaiming Jesus as the true King of the world, and the church continued to face this resistance and even persecution, but they remained a vibrant community, faithful to the way of Jesus. The Philippians sent one of their members, Epaphroditus, to bring a gift to Paul in prison, and Paul sent this letter back with Epaphroditus to encourage the Philippians in their faith.
