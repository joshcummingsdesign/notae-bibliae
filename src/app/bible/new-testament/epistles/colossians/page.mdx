## Synopsis

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) letter to the Colossians (from Colossae in Phrygia in Asia Minor) which he wrote while imprisoned in Rome in 62 AD. The founder of the church Epaphras visits Paul in Rome and asks him about the cultural pressures tempting the church to turn away from Jesus. Paul writes this letter to encourage the Colossians to address the issues that Epaphras had raised, and then to challenge them to a greater devotion to Jesus.
