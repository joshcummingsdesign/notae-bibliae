## Synopsis

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/apostles/paul) letter to <Definition lang="greek" anchor="philemon" text="Philemon" />, a wealthy Christian from Colossae (in Phrygia in Asia Minor) which he wrote while imprisoned in Rome in 62 AD. Philemon most likely met Paul in Ephesus (western Asia Minor) where he became a follower of Jesus. Philemon then became a leader in the church in Colossae, which was started by Epaphras. Philemon had a slave named <Definition lang="greek" anchor="onesimos" text="Onesimus" />. Onesimus wrongs Philemon and they have a serious conflict, and Onesimus flees to Rome where he meets Paul and becomes a follower of Jesus and a beloved assistant of Paul. Paul then writes this letter to call Philemon to not only forgive Onesimus, but to embrace him as a brother in the Lord and no longer a slave.
