## Synopsis

[St. John's](/people/saints/apostles/john) first letter which he wrote to a network of house church communities in Ephesus in around 85–95 AD. These communities had recently gone through a crisis involving a group of people who broke away from the Church, denied Jesus, and stirred up hostility among those who remained faithful. John responds to these events by assuring those who believe that God is with them as they adhere to the truth.
