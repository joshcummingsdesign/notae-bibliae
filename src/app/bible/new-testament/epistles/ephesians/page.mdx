<Initial text="Ephesians"/>

[St. Paul's](/people/saints/paul) letter to the Ephesians (from Ephesus, western Asia Minor) which he wrote while imprisoned in Rome in 62 AD. Ephesus was a huge city, and the epicenter of worship for most of the Greek and Roman gods. Paul spent two years there speaking in a lecture hall called the hall of Tyrannus, and this had a big impact on spreading the gospel throughout Asia Minor. In this letter, Paul explores the gospel story and how it is to affect how we live every part of our life story.
