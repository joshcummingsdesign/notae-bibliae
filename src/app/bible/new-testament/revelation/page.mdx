## Synopsis

Revelation (Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="apokalupsis" text="Apokalupsis" />*) is the final book of the [New Testament](/bible/new-testament). It is a book of prophecy written by [St. John](/people/saints/apostles/john) in the style and tradition of the [Old Testament](/bible/old-testament) [Prophetic Books](/bible/old-testament/prophetic-books) like [Ezekiel](/bible/old-testament/prophetic-books/ezekiel), [Daniel](/bible/old-testament/prophetic-books/daniel), and [Zechariah](/bible/old-testament/prophetic-books/zechariah). It is addressed to seven churches (Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea) in the Roman province of Asia (now western Turkey) who were threatened by false teaching, persecution, idolatry, and complacency. John had been exiled from Ephesus to the island of Patmos (southwest of Ephesus), and Jesus sent his revelation to John to fortify the churches to persevere against the enemy of this world.

## Message to the Seven Churches

* * *

## 1a. Prologue

God reveals his plan through Jesus by way of his angel to John, who records it in a letter to seven churches in Asia (modern western Turkey).

"Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen" (Rev. 1:4-6).

The seven spirits refer to the Holy Spirit, who as one speaks to many, as he did the apostles (Acts 2:3-4) and the seven churches (Rev. 2:7).

"Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen" (Rev. 1:7).

"'I am the Alpha and Omega,' says the Lord God, 'who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty'" (Rev. 1:8).

## 1b. Vision of the Son of Man

John is exiled to Patmos where he is praying in the Spirit on the Lord's day (Sunday) and hears Jesus' voice which tells him to record his message to the churches.

When he looks to Jesus, he sees seven golden lampstands (the seven churches), and sees Jesus clothed in a long white robe with a golden sash. He has white hair, eyes like fire, feet like burnished bronze, a voice like the roar of many waters, and a face like the sun. From his mouth comes a sharp two-edged sword, and he is holding seven stars (angels) in his right hand.

Jesus says, "I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades. Write therefore the things you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this" (Rev. 1:18-19).

## 2. Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira

Jesus calls the church in **Ephesus** to repent, and promises the tree of life to those who endure.

Jesus calls the church in **Smyrna** to endure suffering, and promises the crown of life to the faithful. He says they will not be hurt by the second death, i.e. the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14).

He calls the church in **Pergamum** to repent. He says Satan's throne is on earth. He promises hidden manna and a white stone (given to victors at games for entrance to banquets or jurors at trials to vote for acquittal) with a new name to those who overcome.

He calls the church in **Thyatira** to repent. Those who endure will be given authority over the nations and the morning star (Christ himself).

## 3. Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea

Christ calls the church in **Sardis** to wake up. Those who endure will have their name in the book of life.

To the church in **Philadelphia**, he promises an open door that no one is able to shut. Because they have kept his word, he will keep them from the hour of trial. Those who endure will be made a pillar in the temple of God, and will write on them his new name, the name of God, and the name of the new Jerusalem.

He tells the church in **Laodicea** that they have been neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm. He calls them to wake up. He says he knocks at the door, and to anyone who opens it, he will come in and eat with them. Those who conquer will sit with him on his throne as he did with the Father.

## The Throne of God

* * *

## 4. The Throne in Heaven

John has a vision of God's heavenly throne room. God has the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and there is a rainbow with the appearance of an emerald around his throne. Before God's throne are seven torches of fire (the Holy Spirit), and a sea of glass like crystal.

There are four cherubim, full of eyes, with six wings (lion, ox, man, and eagle), saying, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!" (Rev. 4:8).

There are 24 elders with crowns seated in thrones around God's throne. The elders fall down before God, cast their crowns before him, and say, "Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created" (Rev. 4:11).

## 5. The Scroll of the Lamb

God is holding a scroll with seven seals. An angel asks who is worthy to open the scroll. An elder tells John that the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered and is worthy.

Then, John sees a Lamb standing as if it had been slain. The Lamb has seven horns, representing great power, and seven eyes, representing the Holy Spirit. The Lamb takes the scroll. The cherubim and the elders fall before the Lamb and sing that he is worthy to open the scroll for he was slain to ransom the people for God, making them a kingdom of priests for God who shall reign on the earth. They say that God and the Lamb are worthy of power, honor, glory, and blessing forever. The cherubim say, "Amen," and the elders fall down and worship.

## Seven Seals

* * *

## 6. The First Six Seals

Jesus opens the **first seal** and the first cherub says, "Come!" A horseman with a bow on a white horse is given a crown and comes out conquering.

Jesus opens the **second seal** and the second cherub says, "Come!" A horseman with a sword on a red horse takes away peace and allows for war.

Jesus opens the **third seal** and the third cherub says, "Come!" A horseman with a pair of scales on a black horse pronounces inflation due to scarcity.

Jesus opens the **fourth seal** and the fourth cherub says, "Come!" A horseman named Death on a pale horse is followed by Hades who together are given authority over a fourth of the earth to kill with sword, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts.

Jesus opens the **fifth seal**, and John sees under the altar (where the blood would pool) the martyrs of God. They ask Jesus how long before he will judge and avenge their blood on earth. Jesus gives them white robes and asks them to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants is complete.

Jesus opens the **sixth seal** and there is a great earthquake, the sun goes black, the moon turns red, the stars fall, the sky vanishes, the mountains and islands are removed, and everyone on earth hides from the great Day of the Lord, asking, "Who can stand?"

## 7. The 144,000 of Israel Sealed

John sees four angels holding back the four winds of the earth. He sees another angel with God's signet ring who is ascending with the sun. He commands the four angles to hold back until they have sealed the servants of God on their foreheads.

John hears the number to be sealed, 144,000 in total, 12,000 from twelve of the tribes of Israel. There are, however, some differences in the ordering of the tribes: Juda is first rather than Reuben, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali are listed before Simeon and Levi, Dan is omitted, Manasseh is included, and Joseph is listed instead of Ephraim.

John looks and sees a great multitude that no one could number consisting of people from every nation standing before the Lamb. They are clothed in white robes and have palm branches in their hands. They cry out, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!" (Rev. 7:10). All the angels, cherubim, and elders fall and worship God.

One of the elders tells John the people are the ones coming out of the great tribulation, and that they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. He says that they will serve God day and night in the temple, and he will shelter them. They shall no longer hunger or thirst, the Lamb will be their shepherd who will guide them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

## 8a. The Seventh Seal

Jesus opens the **seventh seal**, and there is silence in heaven for about half an hour. The seven angels who stand before God are given seven trumpets, and another angel stands at the golden altar with a golden censer offering incense with the prayers of the saints. The angel then fills the censer with fire from the altar and throws it on the earth creating thunder, lighting, and an earthquake.

## Seven Trumpets

* * *

## 8b. The First Four Trumpets

The **first angel** blows his trumpet and there is hail and fire mixed with blood thrown upon the earth, burning up a third of it.

The **second angel** blows his trumpet and a burning mountain is thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea becomes blood destroying a third of the creatures and ships.

The **third angel** blows his trumpet and a great star like a blazing torch (named Wormwood) falls from heaven onto a third of the rivers and on the springs of water making the water wormwood killing many.

The **fourth angel** blows his trumpet and a third of the sun, moon, stars are struck and darkened.

An eagle flies overhead and cries, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angles are about to blow" (Rev. 8:13).

## 9. The Fifth and Sixth Trumpet

The **fifth angel** blows his trumpet and a star falls from heaven to earth (Satan, who is here called Destroyer, Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="abaddon" text="Abaddon"/>*, Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="apollyon" text="Apollyon"/>*). He is given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit, which he opens releasing smoke and beastly warrior locusts who sting like scorpions. The locusts are to torment those without God's seal for five months. People will seek death but will not find it.

The **sixth angel** blows his trumpet and a voice from the four horns of the golden altar says to release the four angels bound at the Euphrates who had been prepared for the day to lead 200 million troops into battle to kill a third of mankind. The heads of the horses look like lions, they have fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths, and they have tails that look like serpents.

Those who survive do not repent or give up worshiping idols.

## 10. The Angel and the Little Scroll

A mighty angel comes down from heaven wrapped in a cloud. A rainbow is over his head, his face is like the sun, and his legs are like pillars of fire. His right foot is on the sea, his left foot is on the land, and he has a little scroll open in his hand. He calls out with a thunderous voice, but tells John not to write down what he hears. He does say, however, that at the seventh trumpet call, the mystery of God would be fulfilled, just as he announced to the prophets. John is then told to take and eat the scroll. The scroll tastes sweet like honey, but makes his stomach bitter. John is then told to prophesy.

## 11a. The Two Witnesses

John is given a measuring rod and is told to measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there, but not the outer court, for it will be given over to the nations who will trample it.

John is told that two witnesses (here called olive trees and lampstands) will prophesy for 1,260 days clothed in sackcloth. God will protect them and give them power to persevere against their enemies.

When the witnesses have finished, a beast will rise from the bottomless pit, wage war on them, and kill them. Their bodies will lie in the streets of Jerusalem, which is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt. Some will mourn their death, but some will rejoice. After three and a half days, God will vindicate and raise them with the breath of life. Many will see them taken up to heaven in a cloud, and it will cause great fear. At that time a great earthquake will take out a tenth of the city, killing 7,000 people. The survivors fear and glorify God.

## 11b. The Seventh Trumpet

The **seventh angel** blows his trumpet and loud voices in heaven say, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever" (Rev. 11:15). The elders fall on their faces and worship God for ruling, judging the nations, rewarding the prophets and the saints, and destroying the destroyers of the earth.

God's temple in heaven opens, and the ark of the covenant, which was missing from the second temple, is seen within. There is lightning, thunder, earthquake, and hail.

## The Signs

* * *

## 12. The Dragon

John has a vision of a woman in heaven, clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She is pregnant and crying out with birth pains.

He then sees a red dragon with seven heads and ten horns wearing seven diadems, whose tail sweeps down a third of the stars in heaven, casting them down to earth. The dragon then looks to devour the woman's child, who is to rule. The woman has her child and then flees into the wilderness to a place God prepared for her where she is to be nourished for 1,260 days (a time, and times, and half a time).

A war breaks out in heaven, Michael and his army against the dragon. The dragon is defeated and then cast down to the earth. It is revealed that the dragon is the serpent, who is also called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world.

John hears a voice from heaven saying, "Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. Therefore, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!" (Rev. 12:10-12).

The dragon pursues the woman, but she is given the wings of an eagle to fly from the serpent into the wilderness. The serpent pours water out of his mouth to sweep her away with a flood, but the earth swallows up the water, which enrages the dragon, so he looks to wage war on the rest of her offspring who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

## 13a. The Beast

John sees a leopard beast with the feet of a bear, a lion's mouth, seven heads, and ten horns with ten diadems and ten blasphemous names rising out of the sea. The dragon gives the beast his power, heals one of his wounded heads, and everyone on earth not found in the book of life follows the beast and worships the dragon. The beast utters haughty and blasphemous words, and is given authority for 42 months, making war with the saints and conquering them.

"If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. **Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints**" (Rev. 13:10).

## 13b. The False Prophet

John sees a false prophet with two horns like a lamb who speaks like a dragon rising out of the earth. He has all the authority of the beast and makes all the earth worship him. He performs great signs, and by his signs he is allowed to work in the presence of the beast. He deceives everyone on earth, and convinces them to make an image of the beast. He makes the image speak, and causes those who refuse to worship the beast to be slain.

The false prophet requires all who wish to buy and sell to be marked with the number of his name, 666, on their right hand or on their forehead.

The sixth seal, sixth trumpet, and sixth bowl all depict God's judgment on the followers of the beast. Being marked with the name of the beast on the hand and the forehead represents the anti-Shema (Deut. 6:8).

Seven is the number of completion and of God's Sabbath rest (Gen 2:2-3). Six is the number of unrest, incompleteness, and pride. Man and beast were created on the 6th day (Gen 1:24). Solomon earns 666 talents of gold a year before falling into apostasy (1 Kings 10:14). Goliath was 6 cubits and a span (1 Sam. 17:4). Nebuchadnezzar's image of gold was 60 cubits high and 6 cubits across (Dan. 3:1).

Interestingly, in Hebrew, letters are used to represent numbers. If you transliterate the Greek name of Nero Caesar using Hebrew letters, their numeric values add up to 666. Thus, it's plausible that this number represents Nero, or a Nero-esque leader, heavily persecuting God's people.

## 14a. The Lamb and the 144,000

John sees Jesus on Mount Zion with the 144,000, who are the firstfruits of God's kingdom, singing a new song before God's throne.

An angel flies overhead with an eternal gospel, "Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water" (Rev. 14:7).

Another angel following says, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality" (Rev. 14:8).

Another angel following says, "If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he will drink the wine of God's wrath" (Rev. 14:9-10).

**"Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus"** (Rev. 14:12).

## 14b. The Harvest of the Earth

John sees Jesus seated on a cloud with a sickle. An angel comes out of the temple calling, "Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe" (Rev. 14:15). Jesus swings his sickle across the earth and reaps the fruit (the righteous).

An angel comes out of the temple with a sickle, and another angel comes out of the golden altar calling, "Put in your sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe" (Rev. 14:18). The angel swings his sickle across the earth, gathers the grapes (the wicked), and throws them into God's winepress.

## Seven Bowls

* * *

## 15. The Seven Angels with Seven Plagues

John sees those who conquered the beast standing beside a sea of glass mingled with fire singing the song of Moses and of the Lamb. John then sees the tabernacle in heaven open. It is full of smoke from the glory of God, and out of it seven angels with seven plagues emerge. A cherub gives each of the angels a golden bowl full of the wrath of God.

## 16. The Seven Bowls

A voice calls out from the temple for the seven angels to pour out on the earth the bowls of wrath.

The **first angel** pours his bowl on the earth and pestilence breaks out.

The **second angel** pours his bowl on the earth and the sea becomes blood.

The **third angel** pours his bowl on the earth and the rivers and springs of water become blood.

The angel in charge of the waters says, "Just you, O Holy One, who is and who was, for you brought these judgments. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!" (Rev. 16:5).

The **fourth angel** pours his bowl on the sun and it scorches people with fire, yet they curse the name of God and do not repent.

The **fifth angel** pours his bowl on the throne of the beast and his kingdom is thrown into darkness, and still the people curse God and do not repent.

The **sixth angel** pours his bowl on the river Euphrates and its water dried up to prepare the way for kings from the east. Unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet and assemble the kings of the world for battle on the Day of the Lord at <Definition lang="greek" anchor="harmagedon" text="Armageddon"/> (Greek for Mount Megiddo) (Judg. 5:19) (2 Kings 23:29).

Jesus says, "I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!" (Rev. 16:15).

The **seventh angel** pours his bowl into the air and a loud voice calls from the temple, "It is done!" (Rev. 16:17). There is thunder, lightning, and a massive earthquake which splits Babylon into three parts, destroys all the cities of the nations, and destroys all the mountains and islands. Great 100-pound hailstones fall from heaven on people, and they curse God.

"God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath" (Rev. 16:19).

## The Fall of Babylon

* * *

## 17. The Great Prostitute and the Beast

One of the angels who had a golden bowl takes John into the wilderness and shows him a woman arrayed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and jewels and pearls. She is sitting on the beast over many waters and drinking a golden cup full of abominations and sexual immorality. On her forehead is written, "Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth's abominations" (Rev. 17:5). She is drunk on the blood of the saints. The many waters represent the nations.

The angel tells John that the beast had been slain, but reemerged in order to go on to eternal destruction. Its seven heads represent the seven mountains where the woman rules (Rome, who like Babylon is the embodiment of human pride). Its seven heads also represent seven kings. Five kings have already fallen, one currently reigns, and one is to reign briefly.

The beast's ten horns represent ten other kings who will reign briefly. They will war against the Lamb, but will be defeated as he is the Lord of lords and King of kings. Those with the Lamb are called chosen and faithful. The kings will give all of their power to the beast, who is destined for defeat, and will end up destroying Babylon, thereby fulfilling God's will for its destruction.

## 18. The Fall of Babylon

An angel calls out, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!" (Rev. 18:2).

Another angel says, "Come out of her, my people, lest you take part in her sins" (Rev. 18:4).

The kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her weep and say, "Alas! Alas! You great city, you mighty city, Babylon! For in a single hour your judgment has come" (Rev. 18:10).

The merchants of the earth weep as all trading ceases.

A mighty angel throws a great stone into the sea, saying, "So Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence, and will be found no more" (Rev. 18:21).

## 19a. The Marriage Supper of the Lamb

John hears the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven crying out, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God" (Rev. 19:1). The elders and the cherubim fall down and worship God on his throne.

John hears the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven crying out, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns. Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready" (Rev. 19:6-7).

The angel tells John to write, "Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb" (Rev. 19:9).

John falls down to worship the angel, but he tells John, "You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God" (Rev. 19:10).

John says, "For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy" (Rev. 19:10).

## The Final Battle

* * *

## 19b. The Rider on a White Horse

John sees heaven opened and Jesus with eyes like fire riding a white horse wearing many diadems and a robe dipped in blood. An army arrayed in fine linen is following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which he will strike down the nations.

John sees an angel standing in the sun who calls to all the birds to eat the flesh of those who war with Christ. He sees the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to war against Chirst. The best and the false prophet are captured and thrown into the lake of fire, and Jesus slays the nations with the sword of his mouth. The birds eat the fallen enemies.

## 20a. The Defeat of Satan

John sees an angel coming down from heaven who binds the dragon, who is the serpent and is also called the devil and Satan, and throws him into the bottomless pit for a thousand years. John sees the martyrs and the faithful come to life and reign with Christ for the thousand year period he calls the first resurrection.

"Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years" (Rev. 20:6).

After the thousand year period, Satan will be released, and will deceive the nations and gather them for battle. There nations are called Gog and Magog (Ezek. 38:2). Satan's army surround God's city, but are destroyed by fire from heaven (Ezek. 38:22). Satan is thrown into the bottomless pit to suffer with the beast and the false prophet for all eternity.

## 20b. Judgement Before the Great White Throne

All the dead are brought before the great white throne of God, the books are opened (Dan. 7:9-10), and they are judged according to what they had done. Death and Hades are thrown into the lake of fire along with anyone whose name is not written in the book of life (Ex. 32:33) (Ps. 69:28) (Phil. 4:3).

## The Marriage of Heaven and Earth

* * *

## 21a. The New Heaven and the New Earth

John sees a new heaven and a new earth. He sees the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

He hears a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away" (Rev. 21:3-4).

"And he who was seated on the throne said, 'Behold, I am making all things new'" (Rev. 21:5).

"And he said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son" (Rev. 21:6).

The portion of the wicked is the lake of fire, which is the second death.

## 21b. The New Jerusalem

One of the seven angels who had one of the seven bowls says to John, "Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb" (Rev. 21:9). He carries John away in the Spirit to a great high mountain and shows him the new Jerusalem coming down from heaven from God in its glory and splendor. It has twelve gates made of pearl, three gates on each side, with the name of the sons of Israel. It has twelve foundations with the name of the apostles. The wall is made of jasper and the city and its streets are pure gold, like clear glass. It is adorned with every kind of jewel. Its length, width, and height is 12,000 stadia (1,390 miles). The wall is 144 cubits (216 feet).

"And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day–and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life" (Rev. 21:22-17).

## 22a. The River of Life

"Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever" (Rev. 22:1-5).

## 22b. Jesus is Coming

Jesus says, "And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book" (Rev. 22:7).

The angel says to John, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy" (Rev. 22:10-11).

Jesus says, "Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end" (Rev. 22:12-13).

John says, "Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates" (Rev. 22:14). He warns against adding to or taking away from the words of the prophecy.

Jesus says, "Surely I am coming soon" (Rev. 22:20).

John ends with, "Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen" (Rev. 22:20-21).
