## Synopsis
Written by Luke to record what happens after Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection as the gospel spreads to all nations.

## The Ascension
Jesus appears to the disciples for forty days and speaks to them about the kingdom of God. He orders them to wait in Jerusalem for the promise of the Father, the Holy Spirit, and then tells them they will be His witnesses in Jerusalem, all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. Then Jesus is taken up in a cloud.

## Pentecost
After Matthias is chosen to replace Judas as an apostle, the Holy Spirit descends on the apostles at the day of Pentecost, and they begin to speak in other tongues such that the gospel is heard by the Jewish diaspora who were in Jerusalem for the feast. Peter shares the gospel and calls the people to repent, and about 3,000 are baptized. The believers then begin devoting themselves to prayer, fellowship, the sharing of goods, and the giving of alms, and the number of believers begins to grow.

## Peter Heals a Begger
Peter heals a begger at the temple and glorifies God through Jesus. He shares the gospel and calls for repentance. The number of believers grows to about 5,000. The Sadducees put the apostles in custody and charge them not to speak of Jesus. When they are released the apostles to the believers and they pray for boldness.

## The Apostles Arrested
The high priest sees that the apostles are performing many signs and wonders and arrests them, but in the middle of the night, an angel of the Lord opens the prison doors and brings them out, and charges them to speak the gospel at the temple. The high priest finds them and sets them before the council. They are then beaten and released. They rejoiced they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name, and they go on in the temple and from house to house teaching the gospel every day.

## Stephen Is Killed
The elders and the scribes seize the disciple Stephen (Greek: Stephanos, meaning "crown”), and he recounts the Old Testament before the council and boldly rebukes them for resisting the Holy Spirit, persecuting the prophets, betraying and murdering Jesus, and profaning the Law. Stephen is stoned to death, and as he is dying he cries out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” and "Lord, do not hold this sin against them.”

## The Apostles Are Scattered
A Pharisee named Saul of Tarsus, who approved the stoning of Stephen, begins a wave of persecutions against the followers of Jesus, and all of the apostles are scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.

## Philip Proclaims Christ in Samaria
In Samaria, Philip proclaims the gospel, performs signs, casts out demons, and heals many.

## The Conversion of Saul
While Saul is on the way to Damascus, He is visited by Jesus who says, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” (Acts 9:4). Jesus strikes him blind and tells him to wait in Damascus to be told what to do. He’s without sight for three days and neither eats nor drinks. Jesus then commissions the disciple Ananias to tell Saul he is to carry His name to the Gentiles. Ananias delivers the message to Saul and tells him he will regain his sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit. Saul regains his sight and is baptized. Saul begins proclaiming the gospel, and the Jews seek to kill him, but he escapes Damascus by being lowered in a basket through an opening in the wall. He tells his story to the apostles in Jerusalem, and to protect him they send him off to Tarsus. The church continues to grow.

## Peter’s Vision
Peter heals a man named Aeneas in Lydda (east of Joppa) who had been paralyzed for eight years, and in Joppa (on the coast just south of modern Tel Aviv) raises a disciple named Tabitha (Aramaic for gazelle, Greek: Dorcas). Peter goes up to the housetop to pray at the sixth hour and he has a vision where he sees a sheet descending down full of all kinds of animals. He hears a voice that says, "Rise, Peter; kill and eat.” He refuses to eat what is unclean, but the voice says, "What God has made clean, do not call common.” The Spirit sends him to Cornelius, a God-fearing centurion, and Peter tells him that God shows no partiality. He proclaims the gospel to him and all who are with him, and the Holy Spirit falls on them. Peter commands them to be baptized and then reports back to the church in Jerusalem.

## The Church in Antioch
A multi-ethnic church forms in Syrian Antioch, and the Jerusalem church sends Barnabas who sees the believers and then goes to Tarsus to get Saul. For a year Barnabas and Saul meet with the church, and there they are called Christians for the first time (likely by non-believers as they were often referred to as "the Way” at this time).

## Barnabas and Saul Bring Relief to Jerusalem
The prophet Agabus foretells a great famine, so the disciples determine to send relief to the believers in Judea by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

## James is Killed
James of Zebedee is martyred by Herod Agrippa.

## Peter is Imprisoned
Herod Agrippa imprisons Peter, but an angel of the Lord frees him and he flees to Mary the mother of John Mark’s house where many are gathered in prayer. Herod Agrippa dies soon after.

## Paul’s First Mission (c. A.D. 46-47)
The church in Antioch in the Holy Spirit sends Barnabas and Saul (whose Greek name is Paul) on the first mission into Asia Minor (modern day Turkey). They go to Cyprus (Salamis and Paphos), Lycia (Perga), Galatia (Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe), and then they return and go from Lycia (Attalia) back to Jerusalem.

At each point, they proclaim the gospel to the Jews, most of whom reject Paul and Barnabas, but the Gentiles glorify God and believe.

John Mark accompanies Barnabas and Saul initially, but he leaves them in Perga (Pamphylia in Lycia).

At Lystra, Paul heals a crippled man in the name of Jesus, but the people try to worship Paul and Barnabas instead of Jesus. Then, Paul is stoned by Jews who come to Lystra, and they drag him out of the city thinking he is dead, but he survives.

Paul and Barnabas return to Syrian Antioch and tell the church that God has opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. It is around this time that Paul writes his letter to the Galatians.

## The Jerusalem Council
Division arises in the church in Antioch between the Jews and the Gentiles. The Jews insist circumcision is necessary for salvation. Paul and Barnabas go to Jerusalem to discuss the matter with the apostles there. Peter tells the brothers that God has made no distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles, and that God cleanses us by faith. He urges them not to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples like their fathers did. He tells them salvation is by the grace of the Lord Jesus. Paul and Barnabas share what they did among the Gentiles on their mission. James the brother of Jesus recounts how the Old Testament pointed toward a time when both Jews and Gentiles would seek the Lord (Amos 9:11-12). The council then decides in the Holy Spirit to have the church abstain from things polluted by idols, sexual immorality, and eating meat with blood in it (not only forbidden in the Law, but was a pagan practice of the time).

They send Judas Barsabbas (Hebrew for "son of the Sabbath”) and Silas (Greek version of the name Saul, which means "asked for”, Latin: Silvanus) with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch with a letter explaining the precepts.

## Paul’s Second Mission (c. A.D. 49-51)
Paul and Barnabas separate due to a disagreement about John Mark, and Barnabas goes to Cyprus with John Mark and Paul heads out to Cilicia (Tarsus) with Silas. They go to Galatia (Derbe and Lystra) where they meet Timothy (Greek: Timotheos, means "one who honors God”) who joins them. Paul has a vision that he is to preach the gospel in Macedonia, so they head off for Troas (the west coast of Asia Minor) and then to Macedonia (Neapolis, Philippi, Amphipolis, Apollonia, Barea, and Thessalonica). They go to Achaia (Athens, Corinth, and Cenchreae), to Ephesus (in Asia Minor), and then back to Palestine (Caesarea and Jerusalem). Then they go to Damascus and then back to Syrian Antioch.

In Philippi, Paul casts a demon out of a slave whose owners profit from her fortune telling, and her owners have Paul and Silas beaten and thrown in prison. At midnight, Paul and Silas are praying and singing and suddenly there is a great earthquake that shake the foundations of the prison and open the doors and break everyone’s bonds. The jailer, fearing he will be found guilty and killed, tries to kill himself, but Paul stops him. The jailer asks what he must do to be saved, and Pauls and Silas say, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household” (Acts 16:31). He and his family are baptized. Paul and Silas are released from prison.

In Thessalonica, many beleive, but the Jews form a mob and set the city in an uproar and attack the house of the disciple Jason (Greek: Iason, meaning "healer”, or Greek form of the name Joshua). They drag them to the authorities claiming they are revolting against Caesar (Claudius). They are released on bail. The Jews follow Paul to Barea, and he leaves Silas and Timothy there, and then heads to Athens.

In Athens, Paul reasons with the Jews in the synagogues and with others every day in the marketplace. He is brought to the Areopagus to speak before a group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers where he proclaims the gospel and gets through to some new believers including Dionysious and Damaris.

Claudius drives all the Jews out of Rome. Two Jews named Aquila and Priscilla meet Paul in Corinth. Silas and Timothy meet back up with Paul in Corinth. Many of the Jews in Corinth reject the gospel, so Paul goes to the Gentiles, and together with some of the Jews a church is established there. Paul stays in Corinth a year and six months. It is around this time that Paul writes his letters to the Thessalonians.

The Jews make a united attack on Paul and bring him before the tribunal, but he is released. The Jews attack Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. Gallio, proconsul of Achaia, doesn’t pay attention to any of this because he sees it as a religious matter.

Paul and the disciples go to Ephesus, and he leaves them there before returning to Antioch.

## Paul’s Third Mission (c. A.D. 52-57)
In Paul’s third mission, he goes from Syrian Antioch to Galatia and then to Phrygia (in Asia Minor).

In Ephesus, Aquila and Priscilla meet Apollos, a native of Alexandria with zeal for Jesus. Apollos goes to Corinth, and Paul comes to Ephesus. It is around this time that Paul writes his first letter to the Corinthians.

In Ephesus, Paul finds some believers who aren’t baptized. He baptizes them, and then begins proclaiming the gospel among the Jews. The Jews reject him, so he stays two years speaking in the hall of Tyrannus (a lecture hall). This is the way the gospel spreads throughout Asia Minor. A riot breaks out in Ephesus because they see Jesus as a threat to the greek goddess Artemis, and the town clerk urges the matter to be resolved in regular assembly.

Paul heads to Macedonia. It is around this time he writes his second letter to the Corinthians. Paul then goes to Corinth where he stays for three months. It is around this time that Paul writes his letter to the Romans.

The Jews plot against him as he is about to travel to Syria, so he decides to return through Macedonia. The disciples go ahead to Troas, and Paul goes to Philippi for the Passover and then meets them in Troas. There, a man named Eutychus falls out of a third-story window and dies, and Paul raises him. Then Paul and the disciples go down the west coast of Asia Minor (Assos, Mitylene, Chios, and Samos) in attempts to make it to Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost.

In Miletus (southwest Asia Minor) before Paul heads back to Jerusalem, he writes to the Ephesian elders about his life and ministry and encourages them despite the threat he faces by going to Jerusalem. He then sails off south of Asia Minor (Cos, Rhodes) and Lycia (Patara), and then south of Cyprus until they arrive at Tyre. They go from Tyre to Ptolemais.

They arrive in Caesarea, and Agabus prophesies that Paul will be taken bound by the Jews in Jerusalem. Paul, willing to lay down his life for the Lord, goes to Jerusalem and visits James the brother of Jesus. Paul tells him of his travels and ministry among the Gentiles, and they glorify God.

## Paul Arrested in the Temple
James the brother of Jesus advises Paul to go with four men under a vow to purify themselves in the temple to avoid conflict with the Jews, and he does, but when he’s in the temple, an angry crowd seizes him drags him out of the temple. Word gets to the tribune who sends soldiers and centurions to break up the chaos. They arrest Paul and he is questioned by the tribune who confuses him with a terrorist from Egypt. Paul clarifies he is a Jew from Tarsus, and asks to speak with the people. Paul addresses the people in Hebrew, telling them the story of his conversion. This causes another uproar, so they detain Paul again, and as they are about to flog him, he tells them he is a Roman citizen by birth. They unbind him and call the chief priests and the council to meet. Paul sparks a dialog about resurrection that starts a fight between the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the tribune takes him into the barracks.

## A Plot to Kill Paul
About 40 Jews plot to ambush and kill Paul and make an oath not to eat until he is dead. Paul’s nephew hears about the ambush and tells the tribune. The tribune sends Paul to Felix the governor of Judea. Paul makes his case that he is innocent, but Felix puts off his case and he stays in prison for a few years. Festus succeeds Felix, and Paul makes an appeal to Caesar (Nero).

## Paul Before Herod Agrippa II
Herod Agrippa II, king of Judea, visits Caesarea, and Festus puts Paul’s case before him. Agrippa wishes to hear from Paul, so he is brought before him to plead his case. Paul tells his story, and how Christ died and rose from the dead to be light to both the Jews and the Gentiles, and Festus accuses him of being out of his mind. Paul then asks Agrippa if he believes in the prophets, and Agrippa, feeling pressured, says, "In such a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?” (Acts 26:28). And Paul responds, "Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am—except for these chains” (Acts 26:29). Agrippa finds nothing wrong with Paul and grants his appeal to Caesar.

## Paul Sails for Rome
Paul is sent to Rome with a centurion named Julius, and they set sail, but on the way, Paul tells them that there will be rough seas and that they should stay put. Julius doesn’t heed Paul’s warning and they set off into a storm and end up having to jettison the cargo. In the middle of peril, Paul stands up and tells those aboard (276 men) that God sent an angel to let them know they would survive their trip. They go 14 days without food, and then Paul breaks bread with them giving thanks to God before they throw the wheat overboard. They end up shipwrecked on the island of Malta, but everyone survives.

## Paul on Malta
While on Malta, Paul is bitten by a viper, but he shakes it off into the fire and suffers no harm (Acts 28:3) (Mark 16:18). Paul also heals the chief of the island, Publius, of dysentery. Many more on the island come to Paul and are healed.

## Paul in Rome
Paul arrives in Rome and is greeted warmly by the brothers. Paul thanks God and takes courage. Paul calls the local leaders of the Jews together to tell them his story and proclaim the gospel. Some believe, but many reject him, and he quotes the prophet Isaiah about hearing, but not understanding (Acts 28:26-27) (Isa. 6:9-10). He tells them that salvation has been given to those who listen. He stays in Rome for two years proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching boldly. He remains imprisoned, but it is during this time that Paul writes Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians. Paul is released from prison in Rome and carries on further mission work. It is during this time he writes 1 Timothy and Titus. Paul is imprisoned again in Rome and awaits execution. It is then that he writes 2 Timothy.
