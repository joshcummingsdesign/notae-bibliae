## Synopsis

The <Definition lang="english" anchor="gospel" text="Gospels" /> (Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="euangelion" text="Euangelion" />*) are the four eyewitness accounts of the life, death, and resurrection of [Jesus](/glossary/names#jesus) <Definition lang="greek" anchor="khristos" text="Christ" />, the Son of God.

## John the Baptist's Birth Foretold

A Levitical priest named **Zechariah** and his wife **Elizabeth** have no children and they are advanced in years. As Zechariah is burning incense in the temple in **Jerusalem**, Judea, the angel Gabriel appears and tells him they will have a son named **John** who will be filled with the Holy Spirit and will prepare the way for the Lord. Zechariah doubts Gabriel because of their age and he is made deaf and mute until John is born.

## Jesus' Birth Foretold

Six months later, we meet **Joseph**, a poor craftsman from the line of David, and his virgin betrothed **Mary** (relative of Elizabeth), who are living in **Nazareth** (west of the Sea of Galilee), which is rather looked down upon in the area. The angel Gabriel visits Mary and tells her that she is favored and the Lord is with her. He tells her that she will remain a virgin, the Holy Spirit will come upon her, she will have a son named **Jesus**, the Son of the Most High, the throne of David will be given to him, and "of his kingdom there will be no end" (Luke 1:33) (2 Sam. 7:16) (Isa. 9:7). Mary gives herself as a servant of God in humble submission, saying, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word" (Luke 1:38).

Joseph finds out Mary is pregnant and assumes she has been unfaithful. Levitical law requires stoning, but he considers quietly divorcing her. An angel appears to him in a dream and tells him the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit and his name will be Jesus, and he will fulfill Isaiah's prophecy of Immanuel, which means "God with us" (Isa. 7:14). He takes Mary as his wife and knows her not until Jesus is born.

Mary goes to the hill country of Judea (likely **Hebron**) to visit Elizabeth. Baby John leaps in Elizabeth's womb and Elizabeth is filled with the Holy Spirit. She blesses Mary, and Mary prays the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="magnificat" text="Magnificat" />, which begins with, "My soul magnifies the Lord" (Luke 1:46). She thanks God for his grace and mercy, and for exalting the humble.

## John the Baptist Born

Elizabeth gives birth, and after eight days, they go to have him circumcised according to the Law (Gen. 17:12). The naming of the child often occurred at this time according to Jewish tradition, as Abraham's name is changed right before he receives the covenant of circumcision (Gen. 17:5) (Gen. 17:10), and the naming and circumcising of Isaac occurs together in Scripture (Gen. 21:3-4). The midwives—who were often involved in the naming of a child (Ruth 4:17)—want to name him after his father Zechariah, which is also the name of the famous prophet, but Elizabeth—prompted by the Holy Spirit—says that he shall be called John. They sign to Zechariah and ask him what the baby should be called, and he writes down, "His name is John." Immediately Zechariah's mouth is opened and he is filled with the Holy Spirit and begins to prophesy. Zechariah blesses God for raising up a Savior for whom his son will prepare the way.

John grows up and is in the wilderness until his public appearance to Israel.

## Jesus Born in Bethlehem

Roman emperor Caesar Augustus conducts a census, and everyone is to return to their ancestral land to be registered. Joseph and Mary go from **Nazareth** to **Bethlehem** (city of David—south of Jerusalem).

When they arrive in Bethlehem, they go to the inn, but there is no place for them to stay, likely because many came for the census. Mary gives birth, wraps the baby in swaddling cloths, and lays him in a manger.

## The Shepherds and the Angels

An angel of the Lord appears to some nearby shepherds who were out in the field keeping watch over their flock by night. The angel of the Lord tells them a Savior who is the Anointed King (Christ the Lord) is born. They tell them that the sign for them will be a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger. Suddenly, a heavenly host appears and says, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased" (Luke 2:14). The shepherds find Mary and Joseph and tell them all they had seen. Mary treasures all these things and ponders them in her heart.

## The Visit of the Wise Men

Wise men from the east, likely pagan seers, witness a star in the direction of Jerusalem. They take it to be the fulfillment of Balaam's prophecy that a star shall come out of Jacob (Num. 24:17), so they come to **Jerusalem** to find the Messianic King.

Herod the Great, Roman-appointed Edomite king of Judea, finds out and is troubled, so he gathers the chief priests and scribes, and they tell him Micah's prophecy of the coming King from Bethlehem who will shepherd Israel (Mic. 5:2). Herod then summons the wise men to go to Bethlehem to find the Messianic King.

On their way to **Bethlehem**, the wise men see the star where Jesus is, and follow it. The wise men see Jesus, fall down and worship, and offer him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The wise men are warned in a dream not to return to Herod, so they return home a different way.

## Jesus is Circumcised and Named

After eight days, Christ is circumcised according to the Law (Gen. 17:12), and is then given the name Jesus, as the angel Gabriel foretold.

## Jesus Presented at the Temple

Although Mary needed no cleansing, she fulfilled the rite of purification according to the Mosaic Law (Lev. 12:2-8). After the 40 days, Mary and Joseph bring him to the temple in **Jerusalem** and offer a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. The Holy Spirit sends a man named Simeon into the temple who blesses the Lord for sending a light of revelation to the Gentiles and glory to Israel. He warns Mary that the child is appointed for the rise and fall of many. The Holy Spirit sends a widow named Anna who is a prophetess who sees Jesus and begins to tell the people of the coming redemption.

## Jesus Hidden in Egypt

An angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream and tells him to take Mary and Jesus and flee to Egypt as Herod the Great was out to destroy him. They flee to **Egypt** which fulfills Hosea's prophecy, "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hos. 11:1).

## Herod Kills the Children

Herod the Great realizes that the wise men had not returned, and so he kills all the male children two and under in Bethlehem. This fulfills Jeremiah's prophecy that "Rachel is weeping for her children" (Jer. 31:15).

## Jesus Returns from Egypt

Herod the Great dies, and Joseph, Mary, and Jesus return to **Nazareth** fulfilling the prophecy that Jesus would be a Nazarene, as Nazareth sounds like the Hebrew word for branch (Isa. 11:1).

## Jesus Stays at the Temple on the Passover

When Jesus is 12, Joseph, Mary, and Jesus go to **Jerusalem** to the temple for the Passover. They leave and realize they can't find Jesus, they return back and find him sitting at the temple with the elders who are amazed at his wisdom. His parents ask him what happened, and he says, "Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?" (Luke 2:49). He honors his parents and returns back home with them to **Nazareth**.

## John the Baptist Prepares the Way

In the wilderness, John begins preaching and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. People come to him to be baptized in the **Jordan River**.

The Pharisees and Sadducees come to be baptized, and John the Baptist tells them that just because they are descendants of Abraham does not make them safe from God's judgment, he calls them to true repentance and to truly change their ways.

## Pharisees Question John the Baptist

In **Bethany** (about 2 miles east of Jerusalem), the Pharisees send priests and Levites to John the Baptist to question him about baptizing people in the wilderness. They ask him if he is the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet Moses spoke of, and he says no. He says, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said" (John 1:23) (Isa. 40:3). He tells them, "I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire" (Luke: 3:16). He says, "After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me" (John 1:30).

## The Baptism of Jesus

Jesus comes to John at the **Jordan River** to be baptized. John says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29) (Isa. 53:7). John argues that Jesus should be the one baptizing him, but Jesus insists in order to "fulfill all righteousness" (Matt. 3:15). After Jesus' baptism, the heavens open, the Holy Spirit descends like a dove and rests on Jesus, and a voice comes from heaven saying, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased" (Mark 1:11) (Isa. 42:1). God tells John the Baptist that Jesus is the one who "baptizes with the Holy Spirit" (John 1:33).

## Jesus Tempted in the Wilderness

The Holy Spirit drives Jesus into **the wilderness** among wild animals, where he fasts for 40 days and 40 nights. When he is hungry Satan tells him to command the stones to become bread. He quotes Moses saying, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4) (Deut. 8:3).

Satan takes Jesus to the top of the temple and tells him to throw himself off for "[God] will command his angels concerning you" (Ps. 91:11), and "On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone" (Ps. 91:12). Jesus knows this is blatant misuse of scripture and again quotes Moses, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test" (Matt. 4:8) (Deut. 6:16).

Satan takes Jesus to the top of a mountain and claims he will give him all kingdoms of the world if he worships him. Jesus says, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve'" (Matt. 4:10) (Deut. 6:13).

Satan leaves Jesus, and the angels come and take care of him.

## The Wedding at Cana

Jesus and Mary are invited to a wedding in **Cana** (north of Nazareth in Galilee). The wine runs out at the wedding, and Mary tells Jesus. Jesus tells Mary his hour has not yet come. Mary responds, "Do whatever he tells you" (John 2:5). Jesus has the servants fill up six stone water jars used for purification, and when the master of the feast tastes it, he realizes it had become wine, even better than the first. This strengthens the faith of the disciples.

## Jesus Cleanses the Temple

Jesus goes to **Jerusalem**, for the Passover, and when he arrives, he finds people peddling animals in the temple. He fashions a whip and drives them out. The disciples remember it is written, "Zeal for your house has consumed me" (John 2:17) (Ps. 69:9). The Jews ask him for a sign to prove he's a prophet, and Jesus tells them to destroy the "temple" and he will raise it up in three days.

## Jesus and Nicodemus

Nicodemus, Pharisee and leader of the Jews, comes to Jesus and Jesus tells him that one must be born again to see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus takes him literally, so Jesus reiterates that one must be born of water and the Spirit to enter the kingdom of God. Nicodemus still doesn't get it, so Jesus points out that if he does not understand earthly things as the teacher of Israel, he will not understand spiritual things. Jesus proclaims that he will be like the serpent Moses lifted up in the wilderness, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).

## John the Baptist Exalts Christ

John the Baptist's disciples tell him that Jesus' disciples are baptizing, and all are going to Jesus. He responds by likening Jesus to the groom, and himself to the groomsman. That he is not the Christ, but that Jesus is, and that the Father has given all things into his hand. He says, "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life" (John 3:36).

## Jesus and the Woman of Samaria

The Pharisees learn that Jesus' disciples are growing in number, and that they are baptizing more than John the Baptist, so Jesus heads back to Galilee. On the way, he stops in **Sychar** (north of Bethel in Samaria), and he meets a woman drawing water at Jacob's well. He asks for a drink, and she is shocked he is speaking with her since Jews and Samaritans are not on good terms. He tells her that whoever drinks of his water will never be thirsty again. He tells her all she has ever done, and she thinks he's a prophet. She says she knows of the coming Messiah, and he says it is him. She tells the people in town, and many more come and believe in his Salvation.

Jesus tells his disciples it's time to gather fruit for eternal life and that those before them paved the way for Salvation, and that they will reap what they did not sow, but that the reaper and sower shall rejoice together. "One sows and another reaps" (John 4:37) (Amos 9:13).

## John the Baptist Arrested

John the Baptist reproves Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, for unlawfully marrying his brother's wife Herodias, and Herod has John thrown in prison. He wants to put him to death, but he fears the people as they know John the Baptist to be a prophet.

## Jesus Begins his Ministry

When Jesus is about 30 years old, he begins traveling throughout **Galilee**, proclaiming the good news that the kingdom of God is at hand, and calling the people to believe and repent. His mission is to teach the gospel (the fulfillment of God's promises), and teach he does. People are blown away by the authority with which he teaches. Jesus says, "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel" (Mark 1:15).

## Jesus Rejected at Nazareth

Jesus goes to his hometown of **Nazareth** and stands up to read in the synagogue. He reads from Isaiah, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim the good news to the poor" (Luke 4:18) (Isa. 61:1). Jesus tells them that he is the fulfillment of the prophecy, and they will surely ask for his healing, but breaks the news to them that he will also heal their enemies. He recounts how Elijah healed the son of a woman from Sidon (1 Kings 17:8), and how Elisha cleanses a leper from Syria (2 Kings 5:1). This infuriates the people and they bring him to a cliff to throw him off, but he escapes.

## Jesus Calls the First Disciples

Jesus goes to **Capernaum** (a fishing village north of the Sea of Galilee—the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali). This fulfills Isaiah's prophecy that the people there "have seen a great light" (Isa. 9:1-2).

There, he meets several fishermen, Simon (whom he renames **Peter**) and his brother **Andrew**, and **James** and his brother **John** (their father is Zebedee and their mother is Salome). Jesus begins teaching to the crowd from their boat. The men hadn't caught anything all day, and when Jesus is done teaching, he tells the men to cast their nets into the water, and miraculously they are filled with fish. The men fall and worship, and Jesus tells them that they will be fishers of men.

Jesus goes to **Bethsaida** (east of Capernaum), and meets **Philip** and **Nathanael** (whose Greek name is Bartholomew). Nathanael is skeptical, but Jesus tells him what he was doing hours before (sitting under a fig tree). He falls down and worships, but Jesus says that this is only the beginning and that they will see that he will be the ladder from Jacob's dream, saying, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man" (John 1:51).

## Jesus Begins Healing

Jesus goes to teach at the synagogue in **Capernaum**. In the middle of his sermon, a man begins shouting angrily at him. Jesus says, "Be silent and come out of him!" (Luke 4:35), the unclean spirit leaves him, and people are astounded that he commands even the unclean spirits.

Peter's mother is ill with a high fever, and Jesus heals her. Many begin coming to him for healing, and heal them he does, however, he reminds them that he came to preach the gospel, and so he continues his mission from town to town.

Jesus heals the son of a Roman official, who was possibly an enemy of the Jews.

## The Lord's Prayer

Jesus is praying and one of his disciples asks for him to teach them how to pray. Jesus gives them the Lord's Prayer. He urges them to seek the Father, and makes the point that even if we, who are evil, know to give good gifts to our children, how much more the Father in heaven.

## Jesus Ministers to Great Crowds

Jesus goes all throughout **Galilee** teaching and proclaiming the gospel. His fame begins to spread in and around the territory of Galilee, to Jew and Gentile alike.

## The Sermon on the Mount

Jesus goes up **the mountain** (likely Mt. Eremos between Gennesaret and Capernaum, now called the Mount of Beatitudes) and sits down. His disciples come to him.

He begins with the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="beatitudo" text="Beatitudes" /> (Matt. 5:2). Jesus blesses the poor, those who mourn, the meek, the hungry, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, and the persecuted.

"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?" (Matt. 5:13).

"Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 5:16).

"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law of the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them" (Matt. 5:17).

"If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother" (Matt. 5:23).

"Everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell" (Matt. 5:28).

"Everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery" (Matt. 5:32).

"Do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black" (Matt. 5:36).

"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also" (Matt. 5:38).

"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 5:44).

"When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you" (Matt. 6:3).

"When you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you" (Matt. 6:6).

The Lord's Prayer (Matt. 6:9).

"For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you" (Matt. 6:14).

"When you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you" (Matt. 6:17).

"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Matt. 6:19).

"Do not be anxious about your life…Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?…Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you" (Matt 6:26).

"First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye" (Matt. 7:5).

"Seek, and you will find…If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!" (Matt. 7:7).

"Whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them" (Matt. 7:12).

"Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few" (Matt. 7:13).

"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits" (Matt 7:15).

"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 7:21).

"Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock" (Matt. 7:24).

## Jesus Continues Healing

A man full of leprosy comes to Jesus. Jesus heals him and tells him to make an offering for his cleansing as Moses commanded, but not to tell anyone. The man tells, and people come in droves to be healed by Jesus. So much so that he can't openly enter a town.

Jesus' healing begins to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah that "with his wounds we are healed" (Matt. 8:17) (Isa. 53:5).

## The Cost of Following Jesus

A scribe comes to Jesus and wants to follow him. Jesus tells him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head" (Matt: 8:20). Another disciple wants to follow Jesus, but wants to first go and bury his father. Jesus tells him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God" (Luke: 9:60). Another wants to first return home and say goodbye to his family. Jesus says, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:62).

## Jesus Calms a Storm

Jesus and his disciples get on a boat and a large storm hits, nearly capsizing it. Jesus is sleeping, so his disciples come running to him begging for salvation. He responds, "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith? (Matt. 8:26)". Jesus rebukes the winds and the sea, and there is a great calm.

## Jesus Heals A Man with a Demons

Jesus arrives in **Gadarenes** (Gadara, southeast of the Sea of Galilee, Gentile territory). A man named Legion who lived among the tombs and could not be contained and was possessed by many demons falls before Jesus and begs for mercy. The demons beg not to be cast out of the country, but rather to be sent into some nearby pigs. Jesus casts the demons out into the pigs, and they rush into the sea and drown. The locals beg Jesus to leave, and Legion begs Jesus to come with him, but Jesus tells him to stay and tell his friends of what he did for him. The news of his power and mercy continues to spread.

## Jesus Forgives

Jesus returns to **Capernaum**, and his fame is continuing to spread. Large crowds gather for his sermons. At one of his sermons, some men lower a paralyzed man down from the roof before Jesus. Jesus sees their faith and tells the man his sins are forgiven. This infuriates the Pharisees, who are in the crowd, and they tell him only God can forgive sins. Jesus says, "Why do you question in your hearts? What is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?" (Luke 5:22). Jesus heals the man and all are astounded and glorify God.

## Jesus Calls Matthew

Jesus calls Levi the tax collector (whose Greek name is **Matthew**). Matthew prepares a feast for Jesus, and the Pharisees grumble at Jesus for eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners. Jesus says, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance" (Luke 5:31).

They ask Jesus why the disciples of John the Baptist and the Pharisees always fast and pray, but his disciples always eat and drink. Jesus responds, "Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days" (Luke 5:35). He also tells them, "No one puts new wine into old wineskins" (Luke 5:37).

## Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath

Jesus and his disciples go to pick grain on the Sabbath, which infuriates the Pharisees. Jesus reminds them that when David was hungry and in need, Abiathar gave him the bread of the Presence (1 Sam. 21:4), and how the priests still carry out their duties on the Sabbath. He tells them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath" (Mark 2:27). He says, "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice" (Matt. 12:7) (Hos. 6:6).

Jesus goes to a synagogue and there is a man with a withered hand. The people ask him if it is lawful to heal on the Sabbath so they might accuse him. He says, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?" (Mark 3:4). The people remain silent. He continues, "Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath" (Matthew 12:11). Jesus heals the man, but the Pharisees conspire with the Herodians to destroy him.

Jesus goes to **Jerusalem** for a Jewish feast (possibly the Feast of Booths), and arrives at Bethesda (the Sheep Gate) where there is a pool and many sick and disabled people. He sees a man laying there who had been there for 38 years. Jesus heals him, and the man takes up his bed and walks. The Jews confront the man who is taking up his bed on the Sabbath. Jesus sees the man in the temple and encourages him to sin no more. The man tells the Jews it was Jesus who healed him. The Jews confront Jesus, and he tells them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working" (John 5:17). This outrages the Jews who hate him and want to kill him for making himself equal with God by calling him his Father.

## The Authority of the Son

Jesus tells the Jews who are angry with him, "The Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing…For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will…Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him…An hour is coming when all who are in tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment" (John 5:19).

Jesus continues, "I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will, but the will of him who sent me..his voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen, and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe in the one whom he has sent. You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. I do not receive glory from people. But I know that you do not have the love of God within you" (John 5:30).

Jesus concludes by telling them that if they believed the words of Moses, they would believe in him, because Moses wrote of him. He says, "If you do not believe in his writings, how will you believe in my words?" (John 5:47).

## God's Chosen Servant

Jesus goes on healing and gaining followers, and he tells them not to make him known. His healing of Jew and Gentile alike fulfills Isaiah's prophecy, "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles…a bruised reed he will not break" (Matt. 12:18) (Isa. 42:1).

## Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit

Jesus heals a man who is blind and deaf, and the Pharisees attribute his work to Satan. Jesus makes the point that if Satan casts himself out, he would surely fall. He asks how he would cast down demons unless he has bound up Satan. He says he does his work by the Spirit of God. He says, "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters" (Matt. 12:30). Jesus says all sins will be forgiven, except for speaking against the Holy Spirit.

## A Tree is Known by its Fruit

Jesus tells the Pharisees, "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit" (Matt. 12:33).

## The Sign of Jonah

The Pharisees demand a sign from Jesus, even though he has shown many signs already, possibly to accuse him. He tells them the sign will be that as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, he will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. He says that the Gentiles (here described as Nineveh like in Jonah) will repent and condemn this generation (Matt. 12:41) (Jonah 3:5), but that something much greater than Jonah is here. He gives another example of the Gentiles having a change of heart, when the queen of Sheba exalts the Lord after hearing the wisdom of Solomon (Matt. 12:42) (1 Kings 10:1). He says something greater than Solomon is here.

## Return of an Unclean Spirit

Jesus says, "When an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and finding none it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order. Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself" (Luke 11:24). Cleansing from sin must be followed by obedience to God, not complacency.

## True Blessedness

A woman tells Jesus that his mother must be so happy and blessed. Jesus says, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!" (Luke 11:28).

## Woes to the Pharisees and Lawyers

A Pharisee invites Jesus to dinner, and is shocked that Jesus doesn't do a ceremonial washing. Jesus tells him, "You Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also? But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you" (Luke 11:39).

Jesus rebukes the Pharisees who appear to be pious and clean on the outside, but inside neglect justice and the love of God, likening them to unmarked graves, which if walked on unintentionally, make one unclean without knowing.

Jesus rebukes the lawyers for loading the people with heavy burdens, while not carrying the burdens themselves. He rebukes them for building monuments to the same prophets they and their ancestors persecuted and killed. He says that God will send prophets and apostles, who they will persecute and kill, so that all the blood shed from Abel (Gen. 4:8) to Zechariah (2 Chron. 24:22) may be charged to their generation.

Jesus rebukes the lawyers for not entering the kingdom, and for preventing others from entering through their additions to the Law and their misuse of Scripture.

The Pharisees try to provoke Jesus, lying in wait for him to say something punishable.

## Jesus Restores Life

Jesus comes to Jarius, one of the rulers of the synagogue, who tells him that his daughter has died. Jesus and his disciples leave to follow Jarius, and on the way, a woman who was suffering from a discharge of blood for 12 years (which made her ceremonially unclean) touches the fringe of his garment as she believes he will make her well. Jesus turns to her and says, "Take heart daughter; your faith has made you well" (Matt. 9:22), and she is healed.

When Jesus arrives to see Jerius' daughter, the flute players are already mourning her death. Jesus tells them she is not dead, but sleeping, and they laugh. He takes her by the hand and she arises. The word of this gets out to all the district.

Two blind men call out to Jesus, "Have mercy on us, Son of David" (Matt. 9:27). Jesus asks them if they believe he can heal them. They say yes, and Jesus says, "According to your faith be it done to you" (Matt. 9:29), and their eyes are opened. He tells them not to tell anyone, but they do and his fame continues spreading.

Jesus casts a demon out of a man who is mute, and he is able to speak. The crowds marvel, but the Pharisees accuse him of working for Satan.

## The Harvest Is Plentiful, the Laborers Few

Jesus sees that the crowds beginning to follow him are like sheep without a shepherd. He says to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest" (Matt. 9:37).

## The Twelve Apostles

Jesus goes to **the mountain** to pray, and prays all night. When day comes, he calls his disciples, and from them chooses 12, who he calls <Definition lang="greek" anchor="apostolos" text="apostles" />. They are to be with him and to be sent by him to preach and have authority to cast out demons. He calls **Peter**, **James** and **John** of Zebedee (named Boanerges meaning "Sons of Thunder"), **Andrew**, **Philip**, **Bartholomew**, **Matthew**, **Thomas**, **James of Alphaeus** (also called James the Younger), **Thaddaeus** (also called Judas the son of James), **Simon the Zealot** (Zealots were political activists radically opposed to Roman rule), and **Judas** Iscariot (he is identified here as becoming a traitor; Iscariot means man from Kerioth, a town in Judea).

## The Sermon on the Plain

Jesus comes down from the mountain and stands before a crowd of disciples, and people from all over looking to hear him speak and to be healed.

He begins with the Beatitudes (Luke 6:20). Jesus blesses the poor, the hungry, those who weep, and those who are rejected.

Jesus pronounces woes that parallel his blessings.

"Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you" (Luke 6:27).

"Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not; forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you" (Luke 6:37).

"The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks" (Luke 6:45).

"Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you what he is like: he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock" (Luke 6:47).

## Jesus' Mother and Brothers

Jesus' family includes James of Alphaeus (also called James the Younger), Joseph (also called Joses), Simon, and Judas (also called Jude), and he has sisters as well (Matt. 13:55). As Jesus' popularity grows, his family begins to wonder about his ministry. They show up to his house while he is giving a sermon, and he is told that his mother and brothers are seeking him. He reaches out his hand toward his disciples and says, "Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother" (Mark 3:35).

## The Parable of the Sower

Jesus goes out of the house and sits beside the sea. Great crowds come to him, so he gets into a boat and sits down. He tells them a parable about a sower who goes out to sow. Some seeds fall along the path and birds come and devour them. Others fall on rocky ground and immediately spring up, but the roots are shallow so they get scorched in the sun. Others fall among the thorns and get choked out. Others fall on good soil and produce grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

## The Purpose of the Parables

The disciples ask why Jesus speaks in parables, and he responds, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand" (Matt. 13:11). This fulfills Isaiah's prophecy about those who hear but do not understand (Isa. 6:9). He says, "But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it" (Matt. 13:16). The implication being that those who desire to know the truth of the kingdom will either understand the parable or seek Jesus for the answer, and will therefore begin to understand deeper truths about the kingdom, while those who are resistant will not understand the parable, and will therefore miss altogether the truths of the kingdom. God's wisdom is being offered through Jesus as an act of grace to those who seek it. Those who reject or ignore God's grace will face confusion and judgment, hence what they have will be taken away. Blessed is he who listens to and seeks the truths of the kingdom revealed through Jesus.

## The Parable of the Sower Explained

Jesus explains the parable of the sower. The seeds along the path are the words that never take root in one's heart. They sit on the surface, ready for the birds (the enemy) to snatch it. The seeds that root in rocky ground are the words that take root in one's heart initially and create a superficial excitement, but when bad weather comes and things get hard they fall away. The seeds among the thorns are the words that begin to take root in one's heart, but one lets the cares of the world choke it out of them. The seeds in the good soil are the words that land deep in one's heart, and they let it transform their lives and their actions, bearing fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

## The Parable of the Weeds

Jesus tells a parable about a man who sows good wheat seeds in his field, but an enemy comes along and sows weeds. The man's servants find the weeds and ask the man if he would like them to gather them. The man says that doing so would root up the wheat along with it. He tells them to let the wheat and the weeds grow together, and at harvest time he will have the reapers gather the weeds first to be burned, and then gather the wheat into his barn.

## The Parable of the Mustard Seed

Jesus tells a parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches" (Matt. 13:31).

## The Parable of the Leaven

Jesus tells a parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened" (Matt. 13:33).

## Prophecy and Parables

Jesus speaking in parables calls back to Asaph's historical psalm about God's deliverance in which he opens his mouth in a parable (Matt. 13:35) (Ps. 78:2).

## The Parable of the Weeds Explained

The disciples ask Jesus to explain the meaning of the parable of the weeds. He tells them that he is the one who sows the good seed, the field is the world, the good seed are his disciples, the weeds are the enemy's disciples, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels. He says, "The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father" (Matt. 13:41).

## The Parable of the Hidden Treasure

Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field" (Matt. 13:44).

## The Parable of the Pearl of Great Value

Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it" (Matt. 13:45).

## The Parable of the Net

Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into a fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 13:47).

## New and Old Treasures

Jesus says, "Every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old" (Matt. 13:52). This implies the disciples are to understand the "new" revelation from Jesus and how it fulfills the "old" promises in the Old Testament.

## Jesus Continues to Restore Life

A Roman centurion sends elders of the Jews to Jesus to ask for healing for his servant who is paralyzed. The Jews say he is worthy because he built their synagogue. Jesus goes to heal the man, but the centurion sends friends to tell Jesus he is not worthy to have him under his roof. They tell Jesus he has faith that Jesus can command the healing with his word. Jesus tells the crowd following him, "Not even in Israel have I found such faith" (Luke 7:9). Jesus says the word and the man is healed.

Jesus goes to **Nain** (southeast of Nazareth) with his disciples and a great crowd, and sees a dead man, the only son of a widow, being carried out. Jesus touches the bier and tells the dead man to arise, and he sits up and begins to speak. The people glorify God and say that "A great prophet has arisen among us! God has visited his people" (Luke 7:16). The report spread through all of Judea and the surrounding country.

## Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Apostles

Jesus sends the Twelve Apostles around Jewish **Galilee**. He says not to go to the Gentiles or the Samaritans, but specifically to go to the "lost sheep of the house of Israel" (Matt. 10:6). Their responsibility is to preach repentance, proclaim the gospel, heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, and cast out demons. He tells them to bring nothing, and to accept nothing in return, but they are able to accept food and hospitality. He tells them if the house is worthy, to let their peace come upon it, but if not, to shake off the dust from their feet (a sign the Jews used when leaving Gentile territory). Jesus says because of Israel's special place of responsibility as God's chosen people, their judgment will be greater than that of Sodom and Gomorrah.

Jesus tells the Twelve Apostles, "Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (Matt. 10:16). Jesus prepares them for the persecution that will come from being his representatives, but to fear not for the Father will care for them, and his Spirit will speak through them. He says, "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul" (Matt. 10:28), and "Everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 10:32).

Jesus stresses that the life of a disciple will not be one of peace, but of special responsibility. That even a disciple's family may turn against him in rebellion of his cause, but they are to bear this responsibility with honor.

Jesus says, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:23).

Jesus tells the apostles, "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me" (Matt. 10:40). He tells them that the reward of the prophet and the righteous will be given to the one who receives them, and that the one who cares for even the least of his disciples will be rewarded.

## Jesus Bears Witness About John the Baptist

Jesus' healing and fame greatly trouble the disciples of John the Baptist, who they believe is the great prophet of their time. The fact that he is still imprisoned is also troubling to them. They go to John wondering who Jesus is. Having borne witness already that Jesus is the Messiah, John tells two of his disciples to go and ask Jesus who he is, perhaps to prove a point to them, or perhaps because he has doubts and wonders why he has not been set free from prison.

The disciples of John the Baptist go to Jesus and ask, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?" (Luke 7:20). Jesus says, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me" (Luke 7:22).

The disciples of John the Baptist leave to carry the news to him. Jesus then addresses the crowd with him asking why they think it was that they went out into the wilderness to a wild man eating locusts and wild honey. He makes the point that it could be for no other reason but that John was the prophet who was to prepare the way for the Lord. Jesus says that though there is no other prophet in Israel greater than John the Baptist, there is a new kingdom coming of which the least will be greater than he. He says John is the Elijah prophesied in Mal. 4:5.

Jesus' words about John the Baptist shed light on the fact that those who accepted John's baptism, accepted God's will for them to be prepared for his new kingdom, while those who rejected it, rejected God's will regarding them.

Jesus compares his disciples to children calling out to other children saying, "We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep" (Luke 7:31). The point being that John the Baptist came to lead the people in repentance and mourning (weeping), but many rejected him, and Jesus came to proclaim the gospel (dancing), but many reject him too. He ends by saying, "Wisdom is justified by all her children" (Luke 7:35).

## Woe to Unrepentant Cities

Jesus denounces the cities where his mighty works had been done, yet the people refused to repent. He names Chorazin (northwest of Capernaum), Bethsaida, and Capernaum.

## The Son Knows the Father

Jesus thanks the Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for graciously revealing his truth to the humble and not the proud. Jesus declares, "All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him" (Matt. 11:27).

## Rest For Your Souls

Jesus declares, "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matt. 11:28).

## Jesus Forgives a Sinful Woman

Jesus goes to eat with Simon the Pharisee, and Simon doesn't have his servant wash Jesus' feet (an Israelite custom performed by a servant to welcome strangers or travelers who had just come off a journey). A "sinful woman" who notices this, comes up to Jesus, washes his feet with her tears (sign of repentance), wipes them with her hair (her crown of beauty, throwing her crown at his feet, sign of humility), kisses his feet (sign of honor), and anoints them with ointment (ointment was valuable, sign of sacrifice, recognition of Kingship and holiness). Simon claims that if Jesus really was a prophet, he wouldn't let such a woman touch him.

Jesus responds, "A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he canceled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?" (Luke 7:41).

Simon answers correctly, and Jesus reminds him that he has not shown Jesus the respect and honor that the woman did.

Jesus says, "I tell you, her sins—and they are many—have been forgiven, so she has shown me much love. But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love" (Luke 7:47). Jesus forgives the woman and says, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace" (Luke 7:50).

## Women Accompanying Jesus

**Mary Magdalene** (so called because she was from Magdala on the western shore of Galilee, it is said that seven demons had gone out of her), Joanna (the wife of Chuza, Herod's household manager), and Susanna are among the women who travel with Jesus and the apostles.

## The Death of John the Baptist

Herodias' daughter dances for Herod Antipas and his guests, and he makes an oath to give her whatever she wants. Herodias tells her to ask for the head of John the Baptist. Herod Antipas has John the Baptist executed. John the Baptist's disciples give him a burial and go and tell Jesus the news.

Herod Antipas hears about the fame of Jesus and speculates that he is the resurrected John the Baptist. Others believe he is Elijah. Others believe he is a prophet like one of the prophets of old.

## Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand

On Passover, the apostles return to Jesus, and he hears the news about John the Baptist, and about all the apostles had done, and they sail off toward the wilderness. The people in the towns follow him and gather in a large crowd of about 5,000 men plus women and children as he arrives. Jesus has compassion on them because they are like sheep without a shepherd, and teaches and heals them. At the end of the day, the disciples advise him to send the people back home, but Jesus insists they give the people something to eat. They tell him they only have five loaves and two fish. Jesus asks for them, and tells his disciples to have the crowd sit in groups of about fifty. Jesus looks up to heaven, says a blessing, and then breaks enough bread for the disciples to feed all of the people and be satisfied. They even had enough left over to fill 12 baskets.

## Jesus Walks on the Water

Jesus sends his disciples off in a boat toward Bethsaida, dismisses the crowd, and goes to **the mountain** alone to pray. The wind is strong against them and the waves beat against the boat. At about three in the morning, the disciples see someone walking on the sea, and they think it's a ghost and cry out in fear. Then it is revealed to be Jesus who says, "Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid" (Matt. 14:27). Peter says, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water" (Matt. 14:28). Peter gets out of the boat and walks on the water toward Jesus. Peter gets distracted by his fear of the wind, begins to sink, and yells out, "Lord, save me" (Matt. 14:30). Jesus reaches out his hand, rescues him, and says, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?" (Matt. 14:31). They get into the boat and the wind ceases. Those in the boat worship Jesus saying, "Truly you are the Son of God" (Matt. 14:33). Their hearts, however, remain somewhat hardened.

## I Am the Bread of Life

The crowd goes looking for Jesus, and when they find him, he says, "You are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal" (John 6:26).

The people ask Jesus how to do God's will, and he tells them, "Believe in him whom he has sent" (John 6:29). The people ask for a sign, saying that Moses gave them bread from heaven in the wilderness. Jesus says, "It was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world" (John 6:32).

Jesus says, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst…All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out…For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day" (John 6:35).

The Jews grumble about Jesus and he says, "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day…I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die…And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh…Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day…Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me…Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever" (John 6:44).

Many of the disciples take this literally and turn away from Jesus, so he asks the Twelve Apostles if they want to leave as well. Peter says, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God" (John 6:68). Jesus, however, knows already that there is a traitor among them.

## Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret

Jesus and his disciples arrive in **Gennesaret** (western shore of the Sea of Galilee, southwest of Capernaum, likely the wind had pushed them in the opposite direction from Bethsaida). The people there recognize him and bring to him all who are sick and implore him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. Many touch it and are made well.

## Traditions and Commandments

The Pharisees and the scribes come to Jesus from Jerusalem and ask him why his disciples break the tradition of washing before eating, saying, "Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?" (Mark 7:5). He responds, "And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?" (Matt. 15:3). He points out that God commands that we honor our mother and father, but Jewish tradition allowed them to give what was supposed to go toward caring for their parents to God, which had the appearance of being noble, but actually allowed people to neglect their own mother and father. He quotes Isaiah saying, "This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men" (Matt. 15:8) (Isa. 29:13).

Jesus says, "It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person…What comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart…For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a person" (Matt. 15:11).

## The Faith of a Canaanite Woman

Jesus goes to **Tyre** and **Sidon**, and during this time, a Canaanite woman comes to him begging that he heal her daughter who is oppressed by an unclean spirit. Jesus lets her know he is there for the lost sheep of Israel, but she continues to beg. He says, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs" (Matt. 15:26). She says, "Yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall down from their masters' table" (Matt. 15:27). He commends her for her faith and immediately heals her daughter.

## Jesus Heals a Deaf Man

Jesus goes to the **Decapolis** (10 Hellenistic cities southeast of Galilee) where they bring to him a deaf man with a speech impediment. Jesus pulls the man aside privately and heals him. He charges them to tell no one, but they do, and all are astonished beyond measure.

## Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand

Jesus goes back to the region by the Sea of Galilee, and goes to **the mountain**, and great crowds come to him for healing. He heals them and they glorify God.

Jesus calls his disciples and insists they feed the 4,000 men plus women and children who are with him as they had been there for three days. The disciples tell him they have but seven loaves and a few small fish. He directs the crowd to sit on the ground, gives thanks, breaks the bread, and gives it to his disciples. All ate and were satisfied, and they even had seven baskets left over.

## The Pharisees and Sadducees Demand Signs

Jesus goes to **Magdala** (western shore of the Sea of Galilee), and the Pharisees and Sadducees come to test him, demanding a sign from him. Jesus explains that they can easily predict the weather by interpreting the appearance of the sky, yet they cannot interpret the sign of the times, i.e. the works Jesus is already doing around them. He says, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah" (Matt. 16:4).

## The Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees

Jesus and his disciples head east on the Sea of Galilee, and his disciples realize they had forgotten to bring bread with them. Jesus says, "Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees [and Herod]" (Matt. 16:6) (Mark 8:15). They think he is talking about literal bread, so they begin to worry that they have no bread. Jesus rebukes them for their lack of faith, and reminds them of all the times he provided bread for them and the people. He tells them again, and they understand he is speaking about the teaching and corruption of these groups.

## Jesus Heals a Blind Man at Bethsaida

Jesus and his disciples come to **Bethsaida**, and the people bring him a blind man. Jesus leads him out of the village and heals him, and charges him to go straight home, not even to enter into the village.

## Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ

Jesus comes to **Caesarea Philippi** (north of the Sea of Galilee, center of  the worship of Baal, Pan, Caesar Augustus, and Philip the Tetrarch) and asks his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?" (Matt. 16:13). And they answer, John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets of old who has risen. Jesus asks who they think he is, and Peter answers, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matt. 16:16). Jesus says Peter is blessed because the Father has revealed this to him, and gives Peter pride of place within the future of the Church, of which he says will never be defeated. Jesus strictly charges the disciples to tell no one he is the Christ.

## Jesus Foretells his Death

Jesus tells his disciples, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised" (Luke 9:22). Peter takes Jesus aside and rebukes him in disbelief, saying that this will not happen to him. Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man" (Matt. 16:23).

## The Transfiguration

Six days after Jesus foretells his death, he takes Peter, James, and John to **the mountain** to pray. The disciples fall asleep. As Jesus is praying, the appearance of his face shines like the sun, and his clothes become dazzling white. Then Moses and Elijah appear in glory and speak of his departure (Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="exodus" text="exodus" />*) at Jerusalem. The disciples wake up and see Moses and Elijah, and Peter offers to make three tents for them. Suddenly, a cloud overshadows them, and a voice comes out of the cloud saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him" (Luke 9:35). The disciples fall to their faces and are terrified. Jesus tells them to rise and have no fear, and they see Jesus only. As they come down the mountain, Jesus commands them to tell no one what they saw until his resurrection. They ask him about Elijah, and he tells them that Elijah had already come. They realize he is talking about John the Baptist. Jesus tells them he will suffer and be rejected.

## Jesus Heals a Boy with an Unclean Spirit

Jesus comes down the mountain to a large crowd, and a man begs him to heal his son who has seizures, saying his disciples were unable to do so. Jesus says, "O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you?" (Luke 9:41). Jesus says, "All things are possible for one who believes" (Mark 9:23). The man says, "I believe; help my unbelief!" (Mark 9:24). Jesus heals the boy, and the disciples ask him why they couldn't do so. He says, "Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you" (Matt. 17:20).

## Jesus Again Foretells his Death

Jesus says to his disciples, "Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men" (Luke 9:44). "And they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day" (Matt. 17:23).

## The Temple Tax

Jesus comes to **Capernaum**, and the Jews come to collect the census tax of half a shekel from everyone 20 and up to make atonement for their lives (Ex. 30:11). They ask Peter whether Jesus will pay the tax.

There are many implications here. They could be trying to arrest Jesus for tax evasion. They could be testing to see if the Christ will need a ransom for his life. They could be testing to see if he is the Davidic king, as perhaps the king would not have to pay the tax.

Jesus says to Peter, "From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?" (Matt. 17:25). Peter says from others, and Jesus responds, "Then the sons are free" (Matt. 17:26).

Jesus' answer implies that the Christ, being the Son of God, needs no atonement for his life, but rather makes atonement for others, nor does he need to pay to support the temple of the Father because he is coeternal with the Father. He is also perhaps making the claim to be the Davidic king revealed in the Scriptures. He is everything we hoped for and more. He may also be implying that the sons of this world need a ransom for their life, where the sons of God have no debt.

Even though he does not need to pay a ransom, what does he do? he pays the ransom for both himself and for Peter. How does he do it? By miraculously making a shekel appear in the mouth of a fish Peter catches. He is merciful and gracious. He provides for us and covers for us.

## Who is the Greatest?

The disciples are arguing over who is the greatest, and Jesus says, "If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all" (Mark 9:35). He puts a child by his side and says, "Unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 18:3). He continues, "Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you is the one who is great" (Luke 9:48).

## Anyone Not Against Us Is For Us

John comes to Jesus and says they saw someone casting out demons in Jesus' name and tried to stop him. Jesus says, "Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you" (Luke 9:50).

## Temptations to Sin

Jesus says, "Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than he should cause one of these little ones to sin. Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him" (Luke 17:1). He continues, "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell…Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another" (Mark 9:43).

## The Parable of the Lost Sheep

The Pharisees grumble because Jesus receives sinners and eats with them. Jesus says, "If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish" (Matt. 18:12).

## The Parable of the Lost Coin

Jesus says, "What woman having ten silver coins, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost'" (Luke 15:8).

## The Parable of the Prodigal Son

Jesus tells a parable about a man who has two sons. The younger son asks for his inheritance, leaves home, and squanders it with his reckless lifestyle. He ends up living with pigs. He realizes even his father's servants live better than he, so he decides it is time to repent. He returns home and his father runs to him, and hugs and kisses him. He tells his servants to put a robe and ring on him and kill a fattened calf that they may rejoice. The older son gets angry saying that no one ever did this for him. Jesus says, "And [the father] said to [the older son], 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost and is found'" (Luke 15:31).

## If Your Brother Sins Against You

Jesus says, "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained a brother…If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them" (Matt. 18:15).

## The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant

Peter asks, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?" (Matt. 18:21). Jesus says, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times" (Matt. 18:22). Jesus gives a parable of a king who forgives a man's debt, but then that man turns around and chokes and imprisons another for owing him a debt. Jesus says, "Then [the king] said to [the man], 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all the debt because you pleaded with me. And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?'" (Matt. 18:32). The king then brings a judgment upon him. Jesus says, "So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart" (Matt. 18:35).

## Jesus at the Feast of Booths

In **Galilee**, Jesus' unbelieving brothers tell him to go to Jerusalem for the Feast of Booths so he can show himself to the world. Jesus says, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil" (John 7:6). His brothers go to the feast. He waits for them to leave and then goes to Jerusalem in secret.

In **Jerusalem** at the Feast of Booths, there is much muttering among the people about Jesus. During the middle of the feast, Jesus goes to the temple and begins teaching. The Jews wonder how he teaches without studying, and he says, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood" (John 7:16).

Jesus asks the Jews why they want to kill him, and they deny that they do, saying he has an unclean spirit. Jesus reminds them that they hated him for healing a man on the Sabbath, and he says, "If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well? Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment" (John 7:23).

People continue to mutter and wonder if he is the Christ. They are confused because some rabbis taught that the Messiah would be wholly unknown until the salvation of Israel. Some think he is the Christ. Others think he is the prophet that Moses prophesied. Many think he is from Galilee, so knowing that the Christ was to be born in Bethlehem, they reject him. No one arrests him or lays hands on him because his time had not yet come.

The Pharisees send officers to arrest Jesus. Jesus says, "I will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me. You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come" (John 7:33). The Jews are confused and think maybe he's talking about leaving Palestine.

On the last day of the feast, Jesus stands up and cries, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water'" (John 7:37).

The Pharisees ask the officers why they did not arrest Jesus and they tell them, "No one ever spoke like this man!" (John 7:46). Nicodemus says, "Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?" (John 7:51).

Jesus says, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life" (John 8:12). The Pharisees accuse him of bearing witness about himself. He says, "In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true. I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me" (John 8:17). They ask where his father is and he says, "You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my father also" (John 8:19).

Jesus tells the Pharisees, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world…Unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins" (John 8:23). The Pharisees ask who Jesus is and he responds, "Just what I have been telling you from the beginning. I have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him…When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing of my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him" (John 8:25).

Jesus says to those who believed him, "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (John 8:31). The Jews, who believe that they are noblemen because they are descendants of Abraham, claim to not be enslaved, despite their many oppressors. Jesus says, "Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed" (John 8:34).

Jesus says to the Pharisees, "I know that you are offspring of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father" (John 8:37). They respond, "Abraham is our father." He says, "If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works Abraham did, but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. You are doing the works your father did" (John 8:39).

The Pharisees claim God is their father, and Jesus says, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies…The reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God" (John 8:42).

The Pharisees call Jesus a Samaritan and say he has an unclean spirit. Jesus says, "I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge…If anyone keeps my word, he will never see death" (John 8:49). They respond, "Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?" (John 8:52). Jesus responds, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, 'he is our God.' But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad" (John 8:54). They ask him how it is possible that he has seen Abraham, and he says, "Before Abraham was, I AM" (John 8:58). They pick up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hides himself and leaves the temple.

## Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind

Jesus sees a man born blind and his disciples ask him who sinned, him or his parents. Jesus says, "It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him. We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work" (John 9:3).

On the Sabbath, Jesus spits in mud (breaking one of the Pharisees' laws extrapolated from not being able to do brick masonry on the Sabbath) and anoints the man's eyes and tells him to go wash in the pool of Siloam (means sent, located in Jerusalem). The man comes back seeing.

The man is asked how he is able to see, and he tells them what Jesus did, so they bring him to the Pharisees. Some doubt Jesus because they think he did not keep the Sabbath. Others think based on his previous statements he is a blasphemer and question how he was able to do such signs. The former blind man says he is a prophet. They don't believe the man was really healed, so they call his parents. They testify that he was in fact blind before, but refuse to acknowledge how he was healed for fear of being cut off. The Pharisees try to get him to acknowledge Jesus is a sinner, but the man says, "Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see" (John 9:25).

The Pharisees ask the former blind man again what Jesus did to him, and he says, "Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to be his disciples?" (John 9:27). The Pharisees respond, "We are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from" (John 9:28). The man points out that if they believe God doesn't listen to sinners, it would be hypocritical to believe that Jesus, a sinner, could heal a man born blind. For this, they cast the man out.

Jesus finds the former blind man and asks him if he believes in the Son of Man. The man asks who that is, and Jesus says, "It is he who is speaking to you" (John 9:36). The man then confesses his faith in Jesus. Jesus says, "For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind" (John 9:39). The Pharisees overhear and ask, "Are we also blind? (John 9:40). Jesus responds, "If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, 'We see,' your guilt remains" (John 9:41).

## I Am the Good Shepherd

Jesus says, "He who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers" (John 10:1).

Jesus says, "I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep…I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the father…And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord…This charge I have received from my Father" (John 10:7).

## I and the Father Are One

During the Feast of the Dedication (Hanukkah), the Jews gather around Jesus in the colonnade of the temple and ask him if he is the Christ. He responds, "I told you and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me, but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. I and the Father are one" (John 10:25).

The Jews pick up stones to stone Jesus for blasphemy because he makes himself equal with God. Jesus says, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I said, you are gods'?" (John 10:34) (Ps. 82:6). He says, "If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father" (John 10:35). They try to arrest him, but he escapes and goes back towards the Jordan where John had been baptizing.

## Martha and Mary

A woman named **Martha** from **Bethany** welcomes Jesus into her home. Her sister **Mary** sits at Jesus' feet to listen to his teaching while Martha is busy stressing about serving. Martha gets angry at her sister, but Jesus says, "You are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her" (Luke 10:41).

Jesus becomes very fond of Martha and Mary's brother **Lazarus**.

Jesus goes back to the **Jordan River** where John had been baptizing, and many come to him and believe.

## Jesus Sends Out the Seventy-Two

Jesus sends out 72 of his disciples, two by two, into every town he is about to go. Jesus says, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. Go your way; behold, I am sending you as lambs in the midst of wolves" (Luke 10:2).

Jesus tells the 72 to carry no money or extra belongings, and to stay in a peaceful home, not going from house to house, graciously eating whatever they provide. He charges them to heal the sick and proclaim the gospel. He tells them to shake the dust from their feet from those who reject them because their judgment is coming.

The 72 return rejoicing that unclean spirits are subject to them in Jesus' name. Jesus tells them he saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven, and that he has given them power over the enemy. He says what they should actually be rejoicing over, however, is that their names are written in heaven.

Jesus rejoices in the Holy Spirit and says, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him" (Luke 10:21).

## The Parable of the Good Samaritan

A lawyer asks Jesus what he should do to inherit eternal life, and Jesus asks him what the Law says. He responds, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself" (Luke 10:27) (Lev. 19:18) (Deut. 6:5).

The lawyer asks Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" (Luke 10:29). Jesus responds with a parable about a man going from Jerusalem to Jericho who is robbed and beaten. A priest and a Levite both pass him, but a Samaritan has compassion on him, tends to him and his wounds, and takes him to an inn. Jesus says, "Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?" (Luke 10:36). The lawyer judges correctly, and Jesus tells him to go and do likewise.

## Have No Fear

Jesus says to his disciples, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops" (Luke 12:1).

Jesus continues, "Do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do. But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell" (Luke 12:4). He assures them, however, "Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. Why, even the hairs on your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows" (Luke 12:6).

Jesus continues, "Everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God, but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God. And everyone who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say, for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say" (Luke 12:8).

## The Parable of the Rich Fool

A man in the crowd asks Jesus to tell his brother to divide his inheritance with him, and Jesus says, "Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions" (Luke 12:15). He tells him a parable in which a rich man has an abundance of crops, so he puts them all in a barn so that he can relax and not work (physically or spiritually). Then God comes and tells him he will die, and asks him to whom his riches will belong. Jesus says, "So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God" (Luke 12:21).

## Don't Be Anxious

Jesus tells his disciples, "Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing" (Luke 12:22). He has them consider how God provides for ravens, lilies, and grass, and asks, "How much more will he clothe you?" (Luke 12:28). He continues, "Do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried. For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them. Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you" (Luke 12:29).

He continues, "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart also be" (Luke 12:32).

## You Must Be Ready

Jesus tells his disciples, "Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks" (Luke 12:35). Jesus says those who do not prepare themselves, lose faith, and fall into sin will be numbered with the unfaithful. He says, "Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more" (Luke 12:48).

## Not Peace, but Division

Jesus tells his disciples, "I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled! I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress until it is accomplished! Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law" (Luke 12:49).

## Interpreting the Time

Jesus tells the crowd that they can predict the weather based on the sky and the clouds, but they can't predict what is happening based on the things going on around them.

## Settle with Your Accuser

Jesus tells the people to settle with their accuser before they get to the judge. Either way, they will have to pay.

## Repent or Perish

Pontius Pilate (Roman governor of Judea appointed by emperor) kills Galileans who were trying to offer sacrifices. Also, a tower in Siloam (in Jerusalem) falls and kills 18 men. People ask Jesus if the Galileans suffered because they were sinners. He says, "No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish" (Luke 13:3).

## The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree

Jesus tells a parable about a man who had a fig tree for three years which didn't produce any fruit. He wants to cut it down, but his vinedresser asks for one more year to prepare it for harvest before he cuts it down.

## Jesus Heals a Disabled Woman

Jesus heals a disabled woman in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath and the leader is angry. Jesus says, "You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it? And ought not his woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?" (Luke 13:15).

## The Narrow Door

Someone asks Jesus how many will be saved, and he says, "Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able…some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last" (Luke 13:24).

## Lament Over Jerusalem

The Pharisees come to Jesus and tell him to leave as Herod Antipas wants to kill him. Jesus rebukes them because his time has not yet come. He says, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! Behold, your house is forsaken. And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord" (Luke 13:34) (Ps. 118:26).

## Healing of a Man on the Sabbath

Jesus is invited to eat at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees on the Sabbath, and he heals a man of dropsy. They all watch him carefully, and he implies to them that if they had a son or an ox that fell into a well on the Sabbath, they would indeed pull them out. They are left speechless.

## Parable of the Wedding Feast

Jesus tells Pharisees at the dinner a parable when he notices how they choose the places of honor. He says, "When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him, and he who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Give your place to this person,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest pace. But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted" (Luke 14:8).

## Parable of the Dinner Banquet

Jesus tells the Pharisees at the dinner, "When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just" (Luke 14:12).

One of the men says, "Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!" (Luke 14:15), perhaps changing the subject or perhaps implying that only Jews would be invited to the kingdom. Jesus tells them a parable about a man throwing a banquet, and all the guests make excuses for not coming. The man becomes angry and invites the poor and crippled and blind and lame. There is still room, so he invites all the other people in the area so that the house may be filled. The ones who make excuses don't get to partake in the banquet.

## The Cost of Discipleship

Jesus tells the people that if they want to follow him, they need to give nothing priority over him and the kingdom. He gives the analogy of someone not considering the cost of building a tower, getting the foundation laid, and then not finishing; or a king going to war without deliberation only to find out they will be defeated. He says his disciples are to renounce all that they have.

## The Parable of the Dishonest Manager

Jesus tells a parable to his disciples and the Pharisees in which a manager in charge of a rich man's estate is found to be wasting the man's money. Knowing he will be fired, the manager goes to each one of the man's debtors, reducing their debt so that the debtors will be grateful and take him in. The man finds out and appreciates his shrewdness. Jesus says, "For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light" (Luke 16:8). Then he says, "And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings" (Luke 16:9). He brings it home saying, "One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money" (Luke 16:10).

The Pharisees, who are described here as being lovers of money, ridicule him, and he says, "You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God" (Luke 16:15).

Jesus tells the Pharisees that although John the Baptist was the last of the old covenant age of the Law and the Prophets, and a new covenant age has begun in Jesus and the kingdom (which people are trying to force their way into), the Law still applies, as it is God's word.

## Divorce and Remarriage

Jesus goes straight for a specific example of the Law that he saw the Pharisees to be breaking, adultery. He says, "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery" (Luke 16:18). Marriage is a covenant relationship, as is our relationship with God. Not only did the Jews fall into idolatry on many occasions (Jer. 25:6-7), breaking their covenant with God, they divorced their wives on many occasions (Mal. 2:14) ([Jewish Antiquities 4.253](https://lexundria.com/j_aj/4.253/wst)), breaking their covenant with their spouses. If the divorce law of Jesus' time was not then valid according to Jesus, marrying another would be considered adultery because one would still be considered married in God's eyes. The takeaway here is that when you marry someone, you commit to them forever. You make a covenant with them to become one. Under no ordinary circumstances are you to just up and leave them.

The Pharisees ask Jesus if it is lawful to divorce one's wife. Jesus says, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate" (Matt. 19:4) (Gen. 2:24). They ask him why Moses commanded divorce in Deuteronomy 24. He says Moses didn't command it, but rather gave a process for it due to the brokenness of the community. He says, however, this wasn't God's intention when he made man and woman. He says, "Whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery" (Matt. 19:9). His disciples say then it is better not to marry at all. Jesus says they don't know what they're asking. He says there are people who choose a life of celibacy for God, but that is a hard path that is not for everyone. It is better for one to marry and to become one flesh with his wife. This is what God intended.

## The Rich Man and Lazarus

Jesus tells a parable about a rich man and a poor man named Lazarus. Lazarus is covered with sores, and waits at the rich man's gate for scraps of food. The rich man has no mercy. They both die, and Lazarus is taken to heaven while the rich man is taken to hell. Lazarus is sitting with Abraham in heaven, and the rich man calls to him from hell, begging for mercy. Abraham tells him that he received his good things in life (presumably at the expense of others). The rich man begs Abraham to send Lazarus to his brothers so they might turn from their ways. Jesus says, "[Abraham] said to [the rich man], 'If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead'" (Luke 16:31).

## Increase our Faith

The apostles ask Jesus to increase their faith, and he says, "If you had faith like the grain of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you" (Luke 17:6).

## Unworthy Servants

Jesus explains that we shouldn't expect God to thank us for doing what he commands us to do, we are to remain humble servants of the Lord. That is our duty. Our greatest cause for praise is not what we have done for God, but what God has done for us.

## A Samaritan Village Rejects Jesus

Jesus' time draws near and he heads to **Jerusalem**, sending messengers ahead of him. A Samaritan village rejects Jesus, and James and John ask Jesus if he'd like them to send fire from heaven to consume them. Jesus rebukes them, as their current mission is to preach the gospel, not bring judgment. It is likely that he also wants to assure they have a spirit of love toward their fellow man, and not a spirit of revenge.

## Jesus Cleanses Ten Lepers

On the way to Jerusalem, Jesus passes through **a village between Galilee and Samaria**. Ten lepers stand at a distance and call to Jesus for mercy. Jesus tells them to go and see the priests, and as they go, they are cleansed. One of the lepers realizes he had been healed and runs back to Jesus falling on his face and praising God. Jesus is pleased with the Samaritan (who is identified as a foreigner) and his faith, and commends him. He calls special attention to the fact that the other nine displayed no such faith. He says, "Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well" (Luke 17:19).

## The Coming of the Kingdom

The Pharisees ask Jesus when the kingdom of God will come, and he says, "The kingdom of God is not coming in ways that can be observed, nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There!' for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you" (Luke 17:20). Jesus tells the disciples that the days are coming when they will long to see him on earth, but will not be able to. He says, "For as lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day. But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation" (Luke 17:24). He says like the days of Noah or Sodom and Gomorrah, God's judgment will come quickly and suddenly. He says not to turn back when judgment comes, saying, "Remember Lot's wife. Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will keep it" (Luke 17:32). They ask him where this will happen, and he says, "Where the corpse is, the vultures will gather" (Luke 17:37), which seems to be something like, "where there is smoke there is fire."

## The Death of Lazarus

Lazarus becomes ill, and Martha and Mary send word to Jesus. Jesus says, "This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it" (John 11:4). Jesus waits two days, and then tells the disciples he will be going to Judea. They question his decision because the Jews were just looking to stone him. Jesus says, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him" (John 11:9). He tells the disciples that Lazarus has fallen asleep and he goes to awaken him. They think he is speaking literally and don't understand why Jesus would have to wake him up, so Jesus tells them Lazarus has died and that he will go so that they may believe in him. Perhaps thinking that Jesus would die when they arrive in Judea, Thomas says, "Let us go, that we may die with him" (John 11:16). Jesus arrives in **Bethany** four days after Lazarus had died. Martha goes to Jesus and says, "If you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died. But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you" (John 11:21). Jesus says Lazarus will rise again, but Martha thinks he is talking about the resurrection on the last day. Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he may die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?" (John 11:25). She says, "Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world" (John 11:27). Martha tells Mary Jesus is calling for her, and Mary goes to Jesus, and the Jews who are with her consoling her go with her. Mary says weeping, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died" (John 11:32). Jesus is deeply moved by their weeping. Jesus asks where Lazarus is, and Mary leads them to his tomb, which is a cave with a large stone laying against it. Jesus weeps. People wonder why Jesus didn't come to stop Lazarus from dying. He tells them to take away the stone. Martha worries about the odor as he had been dead four days, and Jesus says, "Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?" (John 11:40). They take away the stone, and Jesus says, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me" (John 11:41). Jesus cries out, "Lazarus, come out" (John 11:43). Lazarus comes out of the cave with his hands and feet bound with linen strips and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus tells them to unbind him and let him go.

## The Plot to Kill Jesus

Some of the Jews believe in Jesus when he resurrects Lazarus, but others go and tell the Pharisees. The members of the Sanhedrin (the Jewish council) wonder what to do about Jesus because they worry everyone will accept Jesus as the Messiah, which they believe the Romans will take as an uprising against Roman emperor Tiberius Caesar, leading them to come and destroy the temple and the nation of Israel. Caiaphas the high priest says, "It is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish" (John 11:50). Caiaphas is unintentionally prophesying that Jesus would die for our sins (Isa. 53:5). From that day on, they make plans to put Jesus to death.

## Jesus Not Found at the Passover

After the Sanhedrin plots to kill Jesus, he goes to the wilderness of **Ephraim** (between Samaria and Judea) with his disciples, and no longer walks openly among the Jews. People cannot find Jesus at the Passover in Jerusalem, and wonder where he is. The Pharisees give orders that if anyone finds Jesus, they are to let them know so they can arrest him.

## Parable of the Persistent Widow

Jesus tells the disciples a parable so that they pray and don't lose faith. The parable is about a judge who neither feared God nor respected man, and a widow who kept coming to him asking for justice. Eventually he gives her justice because she is persistent. If the unrighteous judge gave her justice, how much more will God give justice to his children? Jesus says, "And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?" (Luke 18:7).

## The Pharisee and the Tax Collector

Jesus tells a parable to those who see themselves to be righteous and judge others. A Pharisee and a tax collector go to the temple to pray. The Pharisee thanks God that he is not a sinner like the tax collector, and recounts all his good works. Meanwhile, the tax collector is calling out for God's mercy and acknowledging his sins. Jesus says it is the tax collector who returns home justified before the Lord, rather than the Pharisee. Jesus says, "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted" (Luke 18:14).

## Let the Children Come to Me

People begin bringing infants to Jesus for blessing, and the disciples rebuke him, as children were thought to be a burden until they were old enough to contribute to the family. Jesus tells them, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it" (Luke 18:16).

## The Rich Ruler

A richer ruler says, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" (Luke 18:18). Jesus says, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone" (Luke 18:19). He asks the man if he knows the Ten Commandments, and the man claims to have kept them all from his youth. Jesus tests him saying, "Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me" (Luke 18:22). The man becomes sad, because he is very rich. Jesus sees where his heart really is, on his earthly possessions. Jesus says, "How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God" (Luke 18:24). He says, "There is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life" (Luke 18:29). The disciples ask then how can anyone be saved, and Jesus says, "What man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" (Matt. 19:26).

Peter asks what the apostles will have since they've left everything for the kingdom. Jesus tells them that when he sits on his glorious throne in new creation, they will sit on 12 thrones to judge the tribes of Israel. He says everyone who leaves their life behind for the kingdom of God will receive a hundredfold and receive eternal life. He cautions them, however, saying, "But many who are first will be last, and the last first" (Matt. 19:30). He also warns that blessing doesn't mean this life will be easy, it will come with persecutions (Mark 10:30).

## Laborers in the Vineyard

Jesus tells a parable about a man who has a vineyard and goes out early in the morning to hire laborers to work it. He finds some laborers and they agree to accept a day's wage to work his vineyard. At the third hour, he finds some more laborers and hires them. He does the same at the sixth, ninth, and eleventh hour. At the end of the day he pays everyone a day's wage starting from the last group to the first group. The first group grumbles because they had to work a whole day. The man tells them to take what belongs to them and go. He says that he chooses to give to the last group as he gives to the first, and that he is allowed to do so. He tells them not to begrudge his generosity. Jesus ends with, "So the last will be first, and the first last" (Matt. 20:16).

## Jesus Foretells his Death a Third Time

Jesus tells the Twelve Apostles, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise" (Luke 18:31) (Ex. 19:11) (Isa. 53:3) (Hos. 6:2). The apostles don't fully grasp what he is saying.

## The Request of James and John

James and John ask to sit beside Jesus when he sits on his glorious throne. He says, "You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?" (Mark 10:38). They claim they are able, and Jesus tells them they will get the suffering that comes with being exalted, but the exaltation doesn't come from him, it comes from the Father. The other apostles were annoyed at their request, but Jesus reminds them what it actually means to be exalted, saying, "Whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Mark 10:43).

## Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar

As Jesus draws near to Jericho, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus calls out to him for mercy. The disciples try to quiet him, but he calls out to Jesus and asks him to recover his sight. Jesus calls him over and says, "Recover your sight; your faith has made you well" (Luke 18:42). His sight is immediately recovered, and he follows Jesus, glorifying God. All who witness it praise God.

## Jesus and Zacchaeus

Jesus arrives in Jericho and comes across a short man named Zacchaeus who was a very wealthy chief tax collector. He had climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Jesus through the crowd, and Jesus calls to him and asks to stay with him. Zacchaeus receives him joyfully, but the others grumble because they perceive Zacchaeus to be a sinner. Zacchaeus agrees to give up half of his wealth to the poor, and to restore fourfold anything he has wrongfully taken. Jesus says to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost" (Luke 19:9). Jesus implies his actions and not his ethnic descent make him a son of Abraham.

## Mary Anoints Jesus at Bethany

On **Friday**, six days before the Passover in Jerusalem, Jesus goes to **Bethany**, and Martha, Mary, and Lazarus throw a feast for him. Martha serves, Lazarus sits with Jesus, and Mary anoints Jesus. She takes a pound of pure nard ointment, which is expensive, anoints his feet, and wipes his feet with her hair. Judas Iscariot asks why the ointment wasn't sold. He claims the money could be for the poor, but really it seems that he wants to pocket the money for himself. Jesus says, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial. Truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her" (Matt. 26:10).

## The Plot to Kill Lazarus

On **Saturday**, five days before the Passover, a large crowd gathers around to see Jesus and Lazarus. The chief priests make plans to put Lazarus to death as well, because his resurrection made many people believe in Jesus.

## The Parable of the Ten Minas

On **Sunday**, four days before the Passover, Jesus is approaching Jerusalem and he realizes people have the wrong idea about the kingdom of God. They think Jesus' role is purely political. They think that he will immediately overthrow and defeat the Romans, restore the temple, and be crowned king of Israel. Because of this misunderstanding, he tells them a parable before they arrive.

In the parable, a nobleman leaves the country to be made king (this was common as the leaders of Palestine had to go to Rome to be appointed). He calls ten of his servants, gives them ten minas, and then charges them with doing business while he is gone. The country's citizens hate and reject him, and send representatives to him to tell him so (common for protesters to do during this time). He returns as king and calls his ten servants. The first says his mina made ten more. He is commended and given ten cities. The second says his mina made five more. He is commended and given five cities. The third gives his mina back, criticizing the king for being harsh and undeserving. The king condemns him for not even at least depositing the money to earn interest, which is the bare minimum he could have done. He tells them to take his mina and give it to the one who has ten. The people ask the king why he did this. Jesus shares the response, saying, "[The king replied], 'To everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me'" (Luke 19:26).

This implies that there will be three types of reactions to the kingdom of God. Some will receive Jesus and the blessings with which he encharges them, and share the gospel with others. For this they will be greatly blessed. Some will claim to receive Jesus, but will do nothing and be apathetic. For this they will be judged. Others will hate and reject Jesus, but the twist is that instead of them being slaughtered, Jesus will die for their sins. They will not, however, go without judgment.

## The Triumphal Entry

Jesus draws near to Jerusalem with his disciples. They arrive at **Bethphage** (southeast slope of the Mount of Olives, west of Bethany). He sends two disciples into the village telling them that there they will find a colt, a young donkey on which no one has ever sat, to fulfill Zechariah's prophecy about the Messiah riding in on a donkey (Matt. 21:5) (Zech. 9:9). People ask the disciples why they are taking the colt, and they explain that it is for the Lord, and they let them take it. The disciples return and put their cloaks on the colt, and Jesus mounts it. People in the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut the branches of palm trees, which represented praise and rejoicing (Lev. 23:40) as well as triumph (in Roman culture), and spread them on the road. The crowd shouts, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hoshia-na" text="Hosanna" /> in the highest!" (Matt. 21:9) (cf. Ps. 118:25-26). "Hosanna" was used to address kings. "Blessed is he" calls back to his earlier lament over Jerusalem where he tells them they won't see him until this is said (Luke 13:34). The Pharisees, who are angry that all are going after Jesus, tell him to rebuke his disciples for glorifying him in this manner, and he says, "I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out" (Luke 19:40).

Some God-fearing Gentiles who had come for the Passover (here called Greeks) approach Philip and ask to see Jesus. Philip gets Andrew, and they approach Jesus to let him know. Jesus says, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him" (John 12:23).

Jesus says, "Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father, glorify Your name" (John 12:27). A voice comes from heaven and says, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again" (John 12:28). All hear the voice, and Jesus says, "This voice has come for your sake, not mine" (John 12:30). He continues, "Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself" (John 12:31). The people are confused because they believe the Messiah will live forever. Jesus tells them, "The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light" (John 12:35).

The people are still struggling to believe in Jesus, which fulfills Isaiah's prophecy, "Lord, who has believed what he heard from us" (John 12:38) (Isa. 53:1). It also fulfills Isaiah's prophecy that openness of faith is a gift of grace, "He has blinded their eyes" (John 12:40) (Isa. 6:10). Many do believe in him, but are afraid of losing their life, i.e. being put out of the synagogue, or as John puts it, "They loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God" (John 12:43).

Jesus cries out, "Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me. And whoever sees me sees him who sent me. I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me" (John 12:44).

He draws near to Jerusalem and weeps over the city, saying, "Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation" (Luke 19:42).

He enters **Jerusalem** and the whole city is stirred up, asking who he is. They say, "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee" (Matt. 21:11).

In the evening, Jesus goes to stay in **Bethany** with the Twelve Apostles.

## Jesus Curses the Fig Tree

On **Monday**, three days before the Passover, Jesus and his disciples head back to **Jerusalem**. On the way, Jesus sees a fig tree with no fruit and curses it. The implication perhaps being that Israel is the fig tree that never bore fruit (Luke 13:6) (Jer. 8:13) (Mic. 7:1).

## Jesus Cleanses the Temple Again

Jesus enters the temple and once again drives out the people peddling animals in the temple. He says, "It is written 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers" (Matt. 21:13) (Isa. 56:7) (Jer. 7:11). Here he is quoting Isaiah's prophecy that the temple will be a house of prayer for all peoples, and Jeremiah's prophecy that the first temple would be destroyed for false worship. The blind and the lame come to him in the temple and he heals them. The chief priests and the scribes see everything going on and they hear children saying, "Hosanna to the son of David!" (Matt. 21:15). They ask Jesus if they hear what they are saying, and Jesus says, "Yes; have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?" (Matt. 21:16) (Ps. 8:2). In the Psalms, David says this to God, saying that God gives strength to the weak in the face of their enemies. Here it becomes clear to the chief priests and the scribes that Jesus is claiming to be the Messiah. In the evening, Jesus goes back to stay in **Bethany**.

## The Disciples See the Cursed Fig Tree

On **Tuesday**, two days before the Passover, Jesus and his disciples head back to **Jerusalem**. The disciples see that the fig tree had completely withered. They marvel and ask how Jesus did this, and he says, "If you have faith [in God] and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen" (Matt. 21:21). He continues, "Whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses" (Mark 11:24).

## The Authority of Jesus Challenged

Jesus enters the temple and begins teaching. The chief priests and the elders ask who gave him authority to do what he is doing. Jesus says that he will ask them a question, and if they know the answer, he will tell them. Jesus says, "The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?" (Matt. 21:25). The chief priests and the elders pretend not to know the answer because they fear saying yes would cause an uprising from the crowd who all saw John as a prophet. Jesus says if they don't tell him, he won't tell them.

## The Parable of the Two Sons

Jesus tells the chief priests and the Pharisees a parable about a man with two sons. The man asks his first son to work in the vineyard. At first, he refuses, but then he changes his mind and goes. The second son agrees to work in the vineyard, but then doesn't go. He asks them which one did the will of the father. They all agree that the first son did. Jesus then says, "The tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him" (Matt. 21:31).

## The Parable of the Tenants

Jesus tells the chief priests and the Pharisees a parable about a man who planted a vineyard and leased it to tenants. The man sends his servants to get his fruit, and the tenants kill his servants. He sends more servants, and they again kill his servants. Finally, the man sends his son, whom they should respect, but when they see his son, they plot to kill him and take his inheritance. They throw him out of the vineyard and kill him. Jesus asks them what they think the owner of the vineyard will do to the tenants when he returns. They respond, "He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons" (Matt. 21:41). Then Jesus says, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Matt. 21:42) (Ps. 118:22). The verse from the Psalms that Jesus quotes is about how the Gentiles rejected Israel. He catches them in their hypocrisy by showing how now it applies to how they are rejecting him and the kingdom. He says, "Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to the people producing its fruits. And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him" (Matt. 21:43). They want to arrest Jesus, but they fear the crowds gathered around him.

## The Parable of the Wedding Feast

Jesus tells a parable about the kingdom of God. In the parable, a king gives a wedding feast for his son. The king sends his servants to gather the guests, but they ignore the servants. Finally, some of the guests shamefully reject and kill the servants. The king in his anger destroys the murderers and burns their city. The king, seeing that the guests were not worthy, invites new guests from out of town, both good and bad, and fills the wedding hall. When the king arrives, he sees that some of the guests are not dressed appropriately, and casts them out. Jesus says, "For many are called, but few are chosen" (Matt. 22:14).

## Paying Taxes to Caesar

The Pharisees and the Herodians try to get Jesus to incriminate himself by asking him if it is lawful to pay taxes to Caesar. Jesus asks for a denarius, looks at it, and asks, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" (Matt. 22:20). They say it is Caesar's. Then he says, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's" (Matt. 22:21). Not only does Jesus not incriminate himself, he implies that just as the coin bears the image of Caesar, they bear the image of God, and should give themselves fully to him.

## Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection

The Sadducees who put the Law above all other Scripture, favor earthly interpretations over spiritual ones, and reject the idea of resurrection as they think it cannot be proved out of the Law, ask Jesus a pointed question. They ask that if there is a resurrection, what would happen in a situation where several brothers die in succession and take the wife of the previous brother, who then would be the husband in the resurrection?

Jesus calls them out on two accounts:

1\. Not knowing the power of God

He says, "In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven" (Matt. 22:30). This implies that the Pharisees are asking the wrong question because they have falsely assumed things will be like they are now in the age to come, and that if they really knew the power of God, they would know he has the power to make us knew, right all wrongs, and deepen our relationships with each other and with him. It also implies that though we will know our loved ones in the age to come, marriage is an earthly institution, and is not necessary in eternity.

2\. Not understanding what Scripture says about resurrection

He says, "Have you not read what was said to you by God: 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?" (Matt. 22:31) (Ex. 3:6). Jesus uses the Scripture they value the most, the Law, to make the point that God wouldn't have said he "is" the living God of the patriarchs who had been dead for centuries if they weren't alive in some state of being. Jesus says, "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him" (Luke. 20:38).

## The Great Commandment

The Pharisees test Jesus by asking him which commandment is greatest in the Law, and he responds, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment" (Matt. 22:37) (Deut. 6:5). He continues, "A second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Matt. 22:39) (Lev. 19:18) (Lev. 19:34). He concludes, "On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets" (Matt. 22:40).

## Whose Son Is the Christ?

Jesus asks the Pharisees whose son they believe the Christ to be, and they answer the son of David. He says, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet?"' If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" (Matt. 22:43) (Ps. 110:1). No one can answer him, nor do they dare to ask him any more questions.

## Beware of the Scribes

Jesus says, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation" (Mark 12:38).

## The Widow's Offering

Jesus watches many rich people putting large sums of money in the offering box, and then sees a poor widow put in two small gold copper coins which make a penny. He calls his disciples and says, "This poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. For they all contribute out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on" (Mark 12:43).

## Seven Woes to the Scribes and Pharisees

Jesus says to his disciples regarding the scribes and the Pharisees, "Observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach but do not practice" (Matt. 23:2). Jesus describes how they load people with heavy burdens without carrying any burden themselves. He describes how they love to do things that are seen by others to appear righteous, but inside have evil in their heart. He describes how they love their place of honor and privilege among men. He tells his disciples, "Call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called instructors for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted" (Matt. 23:9).

Then he pronounces seven woes to the scribes and the Pharisees.

1. They reject the kingdom of heaven and shut people out of it.
2. They convert people to Judaism, but teach them false doctrine.
3. They make oaths and swear by the temple, its holy things, and heaven, thereby using God's name to bolster their credibility.
4. They prefer ritual (though they tithe the least of their crops) over the heart of God's laws (justice, mercy, faithfulness).
5. They follow laws and perform rituals to feel clean, all the while being unclean in their hearts.
6. They focus on outward appearances, all the while being full of hypocrisy and sin.
7. They deny that they would have killed the righteous and the prophets like their fathers, all the while stoning and persecuting people in Jerusalem. Jesus says more prophets will be sent to them, and they will reject and kill them. For this, he says, bloodguiltiness from Abel to Zechariah shall be on their hands.

## Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple

One of the disciples is admiring the temple, and Jesus tells him there will come a day when the temple will be destroyed. They go to the **Mount of Olives** opposite the temple, and Peter, James, John, and Andrew ask him when this will happen. He tells them that many will come and falsely claim to be the Christ, but to pay them no mind. He says there will be wars, turmoil, earthquakes and famine, but it won't be the end. He says, "These are but the beginning of the birth pains" (Mark 13:8).

## Jesus Foretells Persecution

Jesus says his disciples will be persecuted for his name's sake. He says people will betray one another, false prophets will arise, and the love of many will grow cold. He says this will be their opportunity to bear witness. He says not to worry about what to say because he will give them the wisdom and words they need to persevere. He says it won't be them speaking, but the Holy Spirit. He says before the end, the gospel will be proclaimed to all nations. He says even their own families may persecute them, and some may even be killed, but their endurance will lead them to salvation. He says, "The one who endures to the end will be saved" (Mark 13:13).

## The Abomination of Desolation

Jesus says that when they see the "abomination of desolation" (Mark 13:14), they should flee and not turn back, for there will be such tribulation as has never been seen, but for the sake of the elect God will shorten the days. He reminds them not to believe those who claim to be the Christ during this time. He says, "For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the corpse is the vultures will gather" (Matt. 24:27).

## The Coming of the Son of Man

Jesus says that at the end of the age, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from heaven, there will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. He says, "For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near" (Luke 21:26). He says, "[I] will send out [my] angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather [my] elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other" (Matt. 24:31).

## The Lesson of the Fig Tree

Jesus says that just as they can see the leaves of a fig tree and know that summer is coming, so too will they see the signs from God and know that the kingdom is near. He says, "Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away" (Luke 21:32).

## Stay Awake

Jesus says regarding his coming, "Watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap. For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth. But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man" (Luke 21:34). He tells them that no one but the Father knows when this will happen, but to stay ready, lest you are found unprepared when he arrives. He says it will be like the days of Noah when he entered the ark, and the wicked went on about their ways until the flood came suddenly. He says, "Stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect" (Matt. 24:42). He says that blessed is the one found faithfully and wisely ministering to others, and cursed is the one found acting wickedly as if his actions are not seen.

## The Parable of the Ten Virgins

Jesus tells a parable in which ten virgins take their torches (which was customary as weddings were done at night in those times) to meet the groom. Five are wise and bring oil with them, and the other five are foolish and do not. The groom is delayed and everyone falls asleep. At midnight someone cries out that the groom is coming. The five wise virgins still have oil, but the foolish ones do not, and the wise do not have enough left to share. The foolish go out to buy more and miss the groom. The wise are invited into the feast and the doors are shut. The foolish are not allowed in when they return. Jesus says, "Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour" (Matt 25:13).

## The Final Judgment

Jesus says, "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And will place his sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.' Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?…' And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of my brothers, you did it to me'" (Matt. 25:31). The wicked will go to eternal fire for not doing so. The righteous will go to eternal life.

## The Plot to Kill Jesus

Jesus says, "After two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified" (Matt. 26:2). Meanwhile, the chief priests and the elders gather at the palace of the high priest Caiaphas, and secretly plot to kill Jesus. They say, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people" (Matt. 26:5).

## Judas to Betray Jesus

On **Wednesday**, the day before the Passover which begins at sundown, Judas Iscariot succumbs to the enemy, and goes to the chief priests and asks, "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" (Matt. 26:15). They pay him 30 pieces of silver, and he lies in wait for Jesus.

## The Passover with the Disciples

Being the day on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, Peter and John come to Jesus to ask where they should prepare for him to eat the Passover. He tells them to go into the city, and they will find a man carrying a jar of water. He says he will invite them in, and show them a large, furnished upper room where they are to prepare the Passover. On **Thursday**, the day of the Passover which began at sundown, Jesus and the Twelve Apostles prepare to eat the Passover.

## Jesus Washes the Disciples' Feet

Jesus knows it is his time to leave this world and return to the Father, but he greatly loves his own who are in the world. He knows that Judas is about to betray him, but he also knows that the Father has given all things into his hands. He stands up from supper, lays aside his outer garments, ties a towel around his waist, and pours water into a basin. He then proceeds to wash all the apostles' feet, including Judas, and wipe them with the towel. Peter asks why he is doing this, and Jesus says, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand" (John 13:7). Peter refuses to have Jesus wash his feet, to which Jesus responds, "If I do not wash you, you have no share with me" (John 13:8). Peter asks Jesus to wash not just his feet, but his hands and head, to which Jesus responds, "The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you" (John 13:10).

There are many implications here:

1. The greatest in the kingdom of God is the servant of all.
2. Christ makes clean, and is not himself made unclean by touching the unclean.
3. Being clean involves the heart, as Judas remained unclean though Jesus washed him.
4. Jesus loves his enemies, as he also washed Judas' feet.
5. When Jesus cleanses us, we belong to him, and have communion with him.
6. Though we are cleansed by Christ's grace (bathed), we must return to him and his grace often (wash our feet) as we live in a fallen world.

Jesus puts his outer garments back on and sits down ("reclines", tables were low to the ground, and the Jews were to eat like royalty to symbolize freedom from Egypt, leaning to the left and eating with the right hand). He says, "Do you understand what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet" (John 13:12). The implication being that they are to serve each other as Christ served them.

## Institution of the Lord's Supper

Jesus says, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God" (Luke 22:15). He takes his cup, gives thanks (Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="eukharistia" text="eukharistia" />*), and says, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves. For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes" (Luke 22:17). Jesus blesses the bread, breaks it and gives it to the apostles, and says, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19). Then he takes the cup and says, "Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:27) (Jer. 31:31). They have the bread and the wine, but where is the lamb?

## Who Is the Greatest?

During the supper, a dispute breaks out among the apostles over who would be regarded as the greatest in the kingdom, and Jesus says, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves. For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves" (Luke 22:25). Jesus says because of their loyalty, he will assign the apostles a kingdom, as the Father assigned him a kingdom, and they will sit at his table, sit on 12 thrones, and judge the 12 tribes of Israel.

## One of You Will Betray Me

Jesus knows there is a traitor among the apostles. He says, "Woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born" (Mark 14:21). Jesus recites David's line in the Psalms about his counselor Ahithophel's role in Absalom's rebellion, saying, "The Scripture will be fulfilled, 'he who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me" (2 Sam. 16:21) (Ps. 41:9) (John 13:18). The apostles wonder who the traitor is. Jesus says it is the one who dipped his hand in the dish with him (this was done when eating the bitter herbs, as was customary). All of them did this, so they are still confused. Peter motions to John who is sitting by Jesus, and John asks Jesus. Jesus tells John that he will give a morsel of bread to the traitor, and then he hands it to Judas. Jesus says to Judas, "What you are going to do, do it quickly" (John 13:27). The apostles think Jesus is talking about something related to money, as Judas managed the money. Judas immediately goes out into the night. He goes to the chief priests and the elders and tells them, "The one I will kiss is the man; seize him" (Matt. 26:48).

## A New Commandment

Jesus says, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify himself, and glorify him at once. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, 'Where I am going you cannot come.' A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another" (John 13:31).

## Jesus Foretells Peter's Denial

Jesus and the apostles sing a hymn, most likely Psalm 118, and then head out on their way to **<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="gath-shemanim" text="Gethsemane" />** (located among the olive groves on the Mount of Olives across the brook Kidron, where olive oil was prepared). Jesus says, "You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered'" (Matt. 26:31) (Zech. 13:7). He continues, "But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee." (Matt. 26:32). Jesus tells Peter that the enemy will cause Peter to lose faith, but that he has prayed for Peter, and Peter will turn again and strengthen his brothers. Peter says that he will never fall away, even if he must die with Jesus. Jesus says to Peter, "Truly, I tell you this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times" (Matt. 26:34).

## I Am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life

Jesus says, "Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way to where I am going" (John 14:1-4). Thomas says, "Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?" (John 14:5). Jesus replies, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6). Philip says, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us" (John 14:8). Jesus replies, "Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?" (John 14:9-10). Jesus says that whoever believes in him will also do the works that he does, and that whatever they ask in his name he will do, that the Father may be glorified.

## Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit

Jesus tells the disciples that if they love him, they will keep his commandments, and he will give them a Helper (Greek: *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="parakletos" text="Parakletos" />*), which he calls here the Spirit of truth, and later calls the Holy Spirit. He says the Spirit dwells *with* them already, but will soon be *in* them.

Jesus says, "I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you" (John 14:18-20). He says that anyone who loves him will be loved by him, and he will manifest himself to them. Judas, perhaps the son of James, asks how he will manifest himself to them and not the world. He says, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him" (John 14:23).

Jesus says, "These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you" (John 14:25-26).

## Peace I Leave With You

Jesus says, "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, 'I am going away, and I will come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place you may believe. I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no claim on me, but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father" (John 14:27-31).

## I Am the True Vine

Jesus says, "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser" (John 15:1). He says that every branch that does not bear fruit, the vinedresser takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit, the vinedresser prunes so that it bears even more fruit. He says just as a branch cannot bear fruit without remaining on the vine, we are to remain in Christ, lest we bear no fruit and are thrown away to whither. He says like a branch removed from the vine, apart from him we can do nothing. He calls his disciples to remain in him, saying, "Abide in me, and I in you" (John 15:4).

## Abide in My Love

Jesus says, "If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full" (John 15:7-11).

## Love One Another

Jesus says, "This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone may lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you" (John 15:12-14).

Jesus says, "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. These things I command you, so that you will love one another" (John 15:16-17).

## The Hatred of the World

Jesus says, "If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of this world, but I I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you" (John 15:18-19).

Jesus says, "Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me" (John 15:20-21).

Jesus says that if they sinned because they didn't know God, it would be one thing, but that those who rejected him knew him and heard his word with their own ears and saw his works with their own eyes, so there is no excuse for their sin and they are guilty. He says this fulfills David's psalm when he said, "Those who hate me without cause" (John 15:25) (Ps. 69:4).

Jesus says, "But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning" (John 15:26-27).

Jesus says, "I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away. They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering a service to God. And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me. But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you" (John 16:1-4).

## The Work of the Holy Spirit

Jesus tells his disciples that he didn't tell them these things because he was with them, but now that his time has come, he is revealing to them what is going to happen. He notices they are sad and he says, "It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you" (John 16:7). Jesus says that when the Helper comes, he will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and the coming judgment; and that the Spirit of truth will guide them, tell them what he has heard from the Father and the Son, and tell them of things to come. Jesus says, "[The Holy Spirit] will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you" (John 16:14).

## Your Sorrow Will Turn into Joy

Jesus says to his disciples, "A little while, and you will see me no longer; and again in a little while, and you will see me" (John 16:16). This confuses the disciples, who have no clue what he means. Perceiving their thoughts, he tells them the answer plainly, saying, "I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father" (John 16:28). Their faith is strengthened because he perceived their thoughts and answered them plainly that he came from God.

He also reveals to them three key things:

1\. Soon, they will see him again.

He says, "You will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy" (John 16:20). He tells them it will be like a woman going through the agony of birth only to be met by great joy when she sees her child. He says they will have sorrow now, but they will see him again, and their hearts will rejoice with a joy no one can take away from them.

3\. Soon, more will be revealed to them.

He says soon they won't need to ask him about the meaning of his life, death, and resurrection, because it will be clear to them. He says, "The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father" (John 16:25).

4\. Soon, whatever they ask of the Father in Jesus' name will be given to them.

He says, "Whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full" (John 16:23-24). He says that it won't be that they will ask Jesus who will ask the Father on their behalf, it will be that they will ask the Father directly in Jesus' name (in accordance with everything he did, said, and stands for), and because God loves them, and they love him in return by putting their faith in Jesus, the Father will give it to them.

## I Have Overcome the World

Jesus says to his disciples, "Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world" (John 16:32-33).

## The High Priestly Prayer

Jesus lifts his eyes to heaven and says, "Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed" (John 17:1-5).

He continues, "I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world…For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you…I am praying for them. I am not praying for the whole world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one" (John 17:6-11).

He continues, "I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth" (John 17:15-19)

He continues, "I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me" (John 17:20-23).

He concludes, "Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me. I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them" (John 17:24-26).

## Scripture Must Be Fulfilled in Jesus

Jesus says, "When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?" (Luke 22:35). They all agree they lacked nothing. He says, "But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'" (Luke 22:36) (Isa. 53:12). The apostles say, "Look, Lord, here are two swords" (Luke 22:38). Jesus replies, "It is enough" (Luke 22:38). There seems to be irony in his response, as two swords clearly aren't enough to fend off an army, and it seems they missed his point: perilous times are ahead; endure.

## Jesus Prays in Gethsemane

Jesus and the disciples arrive in Gethsemane, and Jesus goes off with Peter, James, and John to pray. Jesus says, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death" (Matt. 26:38). He tells the three to watch (stay awake) while he prays. Jesus goes off and prays, "Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will" (Mark 14:36). When he comes back, the three are sleeping. Jesus says to them, "So, you could not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matt. 26:40). Jesus goes off and prays again, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done" (Matt. 26:42). He comes back and they are sleeping again, so he goes off a third time and prays the same words. He comes back and wakes them up, saying, "The hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand" (Matt. 26:45).

## Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus

While Jesus is speaking, Judas, who knows that Jesus often met in Gethsemane with his disciples, comes back with a large crowd of soldiers and officers of the chief priests and the Pharisees carrying lanterns, torches, swords, and clubs. Judas greets Jesus and kisses him. Jesus says, "Friend, do what you came to do" (Matt. 26:50). Jesus says to the crowd, "Whom do you seek?" (John 18:4). They say, "Jesus of Nazareth" (John 18:5). Jesus says, "I am he" (John 18:5). The crowd falls to the ground. Jesus says, "If you seek me, let these men go" (John 18:6). They seize Jesus, and Peter draws his sword and cuts off the high priest's servant Malchus' right ear. Jesus says to Peter, "Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?" (Matt. 26:52). Jesus heals Malchus' ear, and says to the crowd, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But all that has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled" (Matt. 26:56). Jesus says, "This is your hour, and the power of darkness" (Luke 22:53).

All the disciples flee. One of them is wearing nothing but a linen cloth. The crowd tries to seize him, but he slips out of the cloth and runs away naked.

## Jesus Before Annas

On **Friday**, likely midnight after the Passover, the day of preparation before the Sabbath during the week of the Passover, the crowd brings Jesus to the palace of the high priest in **Jerusalem** where he is brought before Annas, the former high priest and father-in-law of Caiaphas. Peter follows him at a distance, and sits with the guards in the courtyard by the fire. Annas begins questioning Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. Jesus responds, "I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said" (John 18:20). One of the officers strikes him and says, "Is that how you answer the high priest?" (John 18:22). Jesus replies, "If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?" (John 18:23).

## Jesus Before Caiaphas

They bind Jesus and take him to Caiaphas where the whole council begins to falsely accuse Jesus in attempts to put him to death, but their testimony is inconsistent. Then, two men come forward and testify that Jesus said to destroy the temple and he would raise it up in three days. They ask Jesus if this is true and he remains silent. Then they ask him if he is the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus says, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" (Matt. 26:64). Caiaphas tears his robe and says, "He uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need?" (Matt. 26:65). They sentence Jesus to death. They spit in his face and cover his face and strike him, saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?" (Matt. 26:68).

## Peter Denies Jesus

A servant girl comes up to Peter and calls out that he was with Jesus. He denies it saying he doesn't know what she means. He goes out to the entrance and another servant girl calls out that he was with Jesus. He denies it again, saying he doesn't know him, this time with an oath. The bystanders notice his Galilean accent and call him out for being a disciple. He denies knowing Jesus a third time, this time invoking a curse on himself. Immediately the rooster crows, and he remembers Jesus' prophecy about him. He goes out and weeps bitterly.

## Jesus Before the Council

Early in the morning, the chief priests and the elders take counsel against Jesus to put him to death.

## Judas Hangs Himself

Judas, feeling great remorse, brings the 30 pieces of silver back to the chief priests and the elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood" (Matt. 27:4). The Jews say that it's not their problem, so he throws the money into the temple. Knowing it's blood money, they buy the potter's field (Valley of the Son of Hinnom) (Jer. 19:2) as a burial place for strangers, and call it The Field of Blood. This fulfills the prophecies of Jeremiah and Zechariah (Jer. 19:6) (Zech. 11:12). Then Judas hangs himself.

## Jesus Before Pilate

The chief priests and the elders bind Jesus, and take him to the governor's headquarters (most likely the Antonia Fortress, a walled Gentile area on the northwest corner of the Temple Mount). They do not enter, as entering a Gentile building made one ritually unclean, and it was the day of preparation before the Sabbath during the week of the Passover. Pontius Pilate meets them outside and asks them what accusation they bring against Jesus. They accuse him of doing evil and claiming to be king of the Jews. Pilate tells them that they should deal with the matter themselves according to their own law. The Jews tell Pilate it is not lawful to put him to death, so Pilate takes Jesus inside to question him.

Pilate asks Jesus, "Are you the King of the Jews?" (John 18:33). Jesus replies, "Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?" (John 18:19). Pilate answers, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?" (John 18:35). Jesus responds, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from this world" (John 18:36). Pilate asks, "So you are a king?" (John 18:37). Jesus answers, "You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world—to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice" (John 18:37). Pilate asks, "What is the truth?" (John 18:38).

Pilate goes back outside to the Jews, "I find no guilt in this man" (John 18:38). The chief priests and the elders accuse Jesus of stirring people up by teaching all over, from Galilee to Judea (his influence poses a huge threat to Roman control). Pilate asks them if he is from Galilee, and they say yes, so he sends him to Herod Antipas, who happens to be in Jerusalem.

## Jesus Before Herod

Herod Anitpas and Pontius Pilate are not on good terms (most likely because Pilate killed Galileans who were offering sacrifices), but Herod is glad to see Jesus because he has long desired to see him. He questions Jesus at some length, and the chief priests and the elders vehemently accuse him, but he remains silent. Herod and his soldiers treat Jesus with contempt, and then dress him up in splendid clothing to mock his claim to kingship. Herod determines that Jesus does not deserve death and sends him back to Pilate. Herod and Pilate become friends (likely because Pilate deferred to Herod's authority in his jurisdiction).

## Jesus Before Pilate – The Crowd Chooses Barabbas

Every year, it was customary for the governor to release any one prisoner he chose (perhaps as a means of winning political favor). Pilate asks the crowd if they want him to release Jesus or Barabbas (a notorious prisoner charged with robbery, insurrection, and murder). Pilate's wife tells him that she suffered a terrible dream about Jesus, and tells him to let Jesus go, as he is righteous. The crowd yells out, "Not his man, but Barabbas!" (John 18:40).

## Crown of Thorns

To placate the crowd, Pilate has Jesus scourged (a Roman judicial penalty consisting of a severe beating with a multi-lashed whip containing embedded pieces of bone and metal). They stand him before the whole battalion who strip him, put a purple robe and a crown of thorns on him, put a reed in his right hand, and mock him by kneeling and saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" (Matt. 27:29). They spit on him, and take the reed and strike him on the head with it. When they are done mocking him, they bring him outside to the crowd.

## Pilate Accused of Opposing Caesar

Pilate asks what they should do with Jesus, and the crowd says, "Let him be crucified!" (Matt. 27:22). Pilate says, "Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him" (John 19:6). They respond, "We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God" (John 19:7). Pilate takes Jesus back inside to question him, asking, "Where are you from?" (John 19:9). Jesus doesn't answer, so he says, "You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?" (John 19:10). Jesus replies, "You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin" (John 19:11). Pilate brings him back outside to release him, but the crowd yells out, "If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar" (John 19:12).

## Jesus Delivered to be Crucified

Fearing the crowd, Pilate brings Jesus to Gabbatha (Aramaic: "The Stone Pavement", the judgment seat). Pilate says to the crowd, "Behold your King!" (John 19:14). They cry out, "Away with him, crucify him!" (John 19:15). Pilate says, "Shall I crucify your King?" (John 19:15). They reply, "We have no king but Caesar" (John 19:15). Pilate washes his hands before the crowd claiming to be innocent of Jesus' blood. The crowd says, "His blood be on us and on our children!" (Matt. 27:25). Pilate sends him away to be crucified.

## The Crucifixion

On their way to **Golgotha** (Aramaic for Place of a Skull, Calvary in Latin, a place where criminals are crucified, located outside the city gate where many people passed by), Jesus carries his cross, but he is weak from the beatings, so they find a man named Simon (father of Alexander and Rufus) who is from Cyrene (a region in North Africa with a large Jewish population) who is in town for the Passover, and tell him to carry Jesus' cross. A great multitude of people follow him to Golgotha, including women who are mourning and lamenting for him. Jesus says to the women, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barrens and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?" (Luke 23:28).

They arrive at Golgotha, and around the sixth hour (12pm), they crucify him, and Jesus says, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). They divide his garments among them by casting lots. This fulfills David's psalm about this very situation (Ps. 22:18). They sit down to keep watch over him. Over his head they write his charge, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews". Crucified on the right and the left of him are two robbers.

Those who come to see him include his mother, his aunt from his father's side (the mother of James the Younger), and Mary Magdalene. Jesus says to his mother who is standing near John of Zebedee, "Woman, behold, your son!" (John 19:26), and he says to John, "Behold, your mother!" (John 19:27).

People pass by shaking their heads at him and ridiculing him, saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross" (Matt. 27:40). The chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mock him saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" (Matt. 27:42). One of the robbers insults him saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!" (Luke 23:39). The other robber rebukes the first, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong…Jesus, remember me when you come into Your kingdom" (Luke 23:40). Jesus says, "Today you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43).

## The Death of Jesus

From the sixth hour (12pm) to the ninth hour (3pm), darkness falls over the land. Then, Jesus cries out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matt. 27:46) (Ps. 22:1). Some of the bystanders think he is calling out to Elijah because in Aramaic it sounds similar. One person takes a sponge filled with sour wine on a reed to give to him to drink, but others stop him saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him" (Matt. 27:49). Jesus cries out, "Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit!" (Luke 23:46) (Ps. 31:5). A soldier offers him sour wine with a sponge on a hyssop branch, and Jesus drinks it to fulfill the psalm of David about this very situation (John 19:28) (Ps. 69:21), and then says, "It is finished" (John 19:30). He bows his head, breaths his last, and gives up his spirit.

Suddenly, the earth shakes, rocks split, the curtain of the temple is torn in two from top to bottom, and the tombs are opened. Everyone is awestruck. The centurion says, "Truly this was the Son of God!" (Matt. 27:54). Everyone goes home mourning and repenting.

## Jesus' Side Is Pierced

It was typical for the Romans to leave bodies on the cross long after death, but on ceremonial occasions, they would take the bodies off of the cross. If the person was still alive, they would break their legs so the person could not support themselves and asphyxiation would ensue. Being Passover, this was the case. They break the legs of the two robbers, but seeing that Jesus was already dead, they don't break his legs, but pierce his side with a spear, and blood and water pour out. This fulfills David's psalm about the Lord delivering from bones being broken, and Zechariah's prophecy about the Messiah being pierced and a great mourning taking place (Zech. 12:10) (Ps. 34:20).

## Jesus Is Buried

One of the wealthy members of the council, Joseph of Arimathea (perhaps in Ephraim), was a good and righteous man, and a secret disciple of Jesus. He opposed the council's decision and action. Joseph goes to Pilate and asks for the body of Jesus. Pilate is surprised that Jesus is already dead, and asks the centurion to confirm. He confirms, and Pilate orders the body to be given to him. Nicodemus brings myrrh and aloes, and Joseph wraps Jesus' body in a clean linen shroud and lays it in his own new tomb in a garden near Golgotha. This is done in haste as the Sabbath was rapidly approaching. This fulfills Isaiah's prophecy about the Messiah's burial (Isa. 53:9). Joseph rolls a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and leaves. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the Younger see the tomb and how his body was laid, so they go to prepare spices and ointments for him, and then prepare for the Sabbath.

## The Guards of the Tomb

On **Saturday**, the Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees gather before Pilate and ask that soldiers guard Jesus' tomb so that none of the disciples would steal his body to falsely claim that he had risen on the third day as he prophesied. Pilate sends soldiers to seal the tomb and guard it.

## The Resurrection

On **Sunday**, the third day after Jesus' crucifixion, the day of the Feast of the Firstfruits, early in the morning while it is still dark, Mary Magdalene goes back to the tomb. When she arrives, she sees the stone rolled back from the tomb and the guards on the ground trembling with fear. She runs to tell Peter and John.

## The Report of the Guards

The guards go to the chief priests and tell them what happened. The chief priests and the elders take counsel. They give a large sum of money to the soldiers to tell the people that Jesus' disciples stole his body. They tell them they will corroborate the story with the governor and keep them out of trouble. They do so and this becomes the story among the Jews to this day.

## Peter and John See the Empty Tomb

Mary Magdalene tells Peter and John the tomb is empty, and the three run to the tomb. John outruns them and arrives first. He looks inside the tomb and sees the empty tomb with Jesus' linen cloths lying there. Peter catches up and looks in with John. Peter goes inside the tomb and sees the cloths, John follows him in. Next to his cloths, they see his face cloth folded up. Peter and John believe he has risen, but don't yet know the meaning. Mary thinks perhaps his body had been stolen or moved. Peter and John run back to their homes, and Mary stays outside the tomb weeping.

## Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene

As Mary Magdalene is weeping outside the tomb, she lifts her head and sees two angels sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. They ask her why she is weeping, and she tells them she doesn't know where they have taken the body of Jesus. She turns around and sees a "gardener" who asks her why she is weeping. She asks the "gardener" if he had moved the body. The "gardener" says her name, and suddenly she realizes it is Jesus. She falls down and worships, taking hold of his feet. He says to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but I go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God" (John 20:17). He says, "Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me" (Matt. 28:10). She goes and announces to the apostles, "I have seen the Lord" (John 20:18). Some time thereafter, Jesus appears to Peter (Luke 24:34) (1 Cor. 15:3-5).

## The Road to Emmaus

Cleopas and another disciple were walking from Jerusalem to **Emmaus** (about seven miles west). A "stranger" comes up to them and asks what they are talking about. Cleopas tells him that Jesus, a "prophet mighty in word and deed", had been crucified, and how they had hoped he would have been the one to redeem Israel. He then tells them that the tomb was found empty and that some had seen angels and said that he was alive. The "stranger" says, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?" (Luke 24:25). The "stranger" then interprets the Scriptures for them concerning himself. They arrive in the evening, and the men urge the "stranger" to stay for dinner. The "stranger" blesses the bread, breaks it, and gives it to them. Suddenly, their eyes are opened and they see that it is Jesus. Then, he vanishes from their sight. They say to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?" (Luke 24:32). They go straight back to **Jerusalem** to tell the apostles.

## Jesus Appears to his Disciples

In the evening, ten of the apostles (all but Thomas) are gathered with the doors locked as they are afraid of the Jews. Suddenly, the doors miraculously open and Jesus walks in and stands among them. He says to them, "Peace be with you!" (John 20:19). They are startled and frightened and think he is a spirit. He says, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have" (Luke 24:38). They all marvel at Jesus. He asks for food, and they give him a broiled fish to eat. He says, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled" (Luke 24:44). He then opens their minds to understanding the Scriptures. He says, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witness to these things. And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high" (Luke 24:46).

## Jesus and Thomas

The apostles say to Thomas, "We have seen the Lord" (John 20:25). Thomas, doubting and perhaps believing they had seen a spirit, says that unless he touches Jesus' hands and feels the mark of the nails, he will never believe. Eight days later, the eleven disciples are gathered again with the doors locked. Jesus again miraculously opens the doors and stands among them. He says, "Peace be with you" (John 20:26). He tells Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe" (John 20:27). Thomas answers, "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28). Jesus tells him, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed" (John 20:29).

## Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples

Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, James, John, and two other disciples were fishing in the **Sea of Galilee**. They fish all night and catch nothing. Just as the day is breaking, a "man" calls to them from the shore, asks them if they have caught any fish, and tells them to cast their net to the right of the boat. They cast their net, and they catch 153 large fish. John says to Peter, "It is the Lord! (John 21:7). Peter jumps into the water and swims to shore. The other disciples come in the boat, and bring the net full of fish. When they get to shore, they see Jesus by a charcoal fire with bread and fish. He calls them over to have breakfast.

## Jesus and Peter

After breakfast, Jesus asks Peter, "Do you love me more than these?" (John 21:15). Peter says, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you" (John 21:15). Jesus says, "Feed my lambs" (John 21:15). He asks a second time, "Do you love me?" (John 21:16). Peter replies the same. Jesus says, "Tend my sheep" (John 21:16). Jesus asks a third time, "Do you love me?" (John 21:17). Peter says, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you" (John 21:17). Jesus says, "Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go…Follow me" (John 21:17). Peter asks about John, and Jesus says, "If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!" (John 21:22). The disciples begin calling John the disciple that is not to die. John points out that Jesus was simply making a point that Peter should follow him and leave the fate of other disciples to him.

## The Great Commission

Some time later, the apostles are called in the Spirit to go to **the mountain** in Galilee. When they arrive, they see Jesus and can't believe their eyes. They fall down and worship. Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:18-20).

## The Ascension

Jesus leads the apostles to **Bethany**. When they arrive, he blesses them, and then is carried up into heaven. They worship him, and then return to **Jerusalem** with great joy. They worship continually in the temple blessing God. Following his resurrection, Jesus was on the earth for 40 days before the Ascension (Acts 1:3).

## Conclusion

"Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (John 20:30-31).

"Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written" (John 21:25).
