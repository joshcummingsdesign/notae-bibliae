<Initial text="Eden"/>

* The word <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="eden" text="Eden" /> conveys a sense of paradise.

* The Septuagint uses the word *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="paradeisos" text="Paradeisos" />* for garden.

* Even though the Bible tells us that it is in the east (the direction of the sunrise), and that there is a river flowing out of it to form four rivers, using familiar names to describe it geographically, it's location remains a mystery, and need not be determined to understand the Biblical account of creation.
