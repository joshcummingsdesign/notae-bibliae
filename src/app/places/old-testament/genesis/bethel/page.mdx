- At first it is called Luz (Hebrew: לוּז, "almond tree"), but it is later renamed Bethel (Hebrew: בֵּית אֵל, "House of God") by Jacob (Gen. 28:17-19).

- Bethel is west of [Ai](/places/old-testament/genesis/ai) and about 12 miles north of [Jerusalem](/places/old-testament/genesis/jerusalem) in the land that became Ephraim.

- The Lord calls Abraham and he takes Sarah and Lot up from [Haran](/places/old-testament/genesis/haran) and they pass through [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem). Then they arrive at the place between Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. Then he builds an altar to the Lord there (Gen 12:8).

- When Jacob flees from Esau and goes to Haran, he stops there, and God sends him a vision of a ladder reaching to heaven upon which the angels of God are ascending and descending (Gen. 28:12). God then reaffirms to him the promise he made to Abraham and Isaac (Gen. 28:13-14), and Jacob sets up a stone pillar as a memorial. Jacob makes a vow to the Lord that when he returns safely, he will worship him and give him a tenth of everything (Gen. 28:20-22).

- When Jacob returns to the land from Haran, he goes to [Succoth](/places/old-testament/genesis/succoth) (Gen. 33:17) and then Shechem (Gen. 33:18). At Schechem, God tells him to return to Bethel and build an altar to the Lord there where he had appeared to him before (Gen. 35:1). God appears to Jacob and reaffirms that his name shall be Israel (Gen. 35:9-10), and that the promise he made to Abraham and Isaac will carry on through him, that nations and even kings will come from him, and that he and his offspring will inherit the promised land (Gen. 35:11-12). Jacob sets up another stone pillar there as a memorial (Gen. 35:14).

- On the way from Bethel to [Bethlehem](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethlehem), Rachel has a hard labor (Gen. 35:16-17). She dies giving birth to Benjamin, and is buried on the way (Gen. 35:18-19). Jacob sets up a pillar over her tomb (Gen. 35:20).
