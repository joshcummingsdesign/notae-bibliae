- Nimrod, the son of Ham's son Cush, built Babel (Babylon), Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in Shinar ([Babylonia](/places/old-testament/genesis/babylonia)) (Gen. 10:8-11).

- The Tower of Babel was built there (Gen. 11:2-3), and God scattered the people and confused their language, hence the name Babel (Gen. 11:8-9).
