- A place in [Hebron](/places/old-testament/genesis/hebron) named after an Amorite ally of Abraham (Gen. 14:13).

- After Abraham and Lot separate, Abraham goes from the place between [Bethel](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethel) and [Ai](/places/old-testament/genesis/ai) to Hebron and settles by the Oaks of Mamre and builds an altar to the Lord there (Gen 13:18).

- Here Abraham was visited by three angels (Gen. 18:1-2) (cf. Gen. 19:1) (cf. Heb. 13:2).
