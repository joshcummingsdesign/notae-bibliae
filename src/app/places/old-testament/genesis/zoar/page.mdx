- It also called Bela (Gen 14:2), Zoar is located in the Jordon Valley, the lower course of the [Jordan River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jordan-river), just south of the [Dead Sea](/places/old-testament/genesis/dead-sea). South of [Sodom](/places/old-testament/genesis/sodom) and [Gomorrah](/places/old-testament/genesis/gomorrah).

- When Abraham and Lot separate, Lot heads towards Zoar because the Jordan Valley is rich in natural resources. Lot ends up in Sodom, just north of Gomorrah. The men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord. (Gen 13:10-13).

- In Hebrew, Zoar (צֹעַר) means "little", as it is the little city that Lot flees to when God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:20-22).
