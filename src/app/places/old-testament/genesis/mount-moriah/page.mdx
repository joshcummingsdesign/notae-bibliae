- Between [Mount Zion](/places/old-testament/2-samuel/mount-zion) to the west and the [Mount of Olives](/places/old-testament/2-samuel/mount-of-olives) to the east in [Jerusalem](/places/old-testament/genesis/jerusalem).

- The location where God tests Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his only son Isaac (Gen. 22:1-2).

- After God provided a ram in the place of Isaac, Abraham called the place *YHWH-jireh* (יהוה יראה, "the Lord sees" or "the Lord provides") as it was said, "On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided" (Gen. 22:14).
