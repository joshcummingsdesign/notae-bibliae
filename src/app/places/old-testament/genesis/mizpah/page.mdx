- A city in [Gilead](/places/old-testament/genesis/gilead).

- When Jacob fled to Gilead from Laban (Gen. 31:25), they made a covenant and set up a stone pillar as a witness (Gen. 31:44-46). Laban called Gilead Jegar-sahadutha, which is Aramaic for "the heap of witness". Jacob called it Galeed (גַּלְעֵד) which is the Hebrew equivalent (Gen. 31:47). Laban named the city of Mizpah (מִצְפָּה), which is Hebrew for "watchpost", as he said, "the Lord watch between you and me" (Gen. 31:48-49).
