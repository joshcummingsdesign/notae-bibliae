- Ai is east of [Bethel](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethel) and about 12 miles north of [Jerusalem](/places/old-testament/genesis/jerusalem) in the land that became Ephraim.

- The Lord calls Abraham and he takes Sarah and Lot up from [Haran](/places/old-testament/genesis/haran) and they pass through [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem). Then they arrive at the place between Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. Then he builds an altar to the Lord there (Gen 12:8).
