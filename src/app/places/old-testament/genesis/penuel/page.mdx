- Penuel, or Peniel, is a city along the [Jabbok River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jabbok-river), west of [Mahanaim](/places/old-testament/genesis/mahanaim) in [Gilead](/places/old-testament/genesis/gilead).

- Jacob wrestles with God there and is renamed Israel, so he names the place Peniel (פְּנִיאֵ֑ל), which means "the face of God" in Hebrew (Gen. 32:28-30).
