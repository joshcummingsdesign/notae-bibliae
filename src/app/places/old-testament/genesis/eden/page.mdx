<Initial text="Eden" />

- The word <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="eden" text="Eden" /> conveys a sense of paradise (Gen. 2:8).

- The Septuagint uses the word *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="paradeisos" text="paradeisos" />* for "garden" (Gen. 2:8).

- Even though the Bible tells us that Eden is in the east (the direction of the sunrise), and there is a river flowing out from it to form four rivers, and the Bible uses familiar names to describe it geographically, it's location remains a mystery, and need not be determined to understand the biblical account of creation (Gen. 2:10).
