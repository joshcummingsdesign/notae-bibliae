- The land east of the [Jordan River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jordan-river), south of [Bashan](/places/old-testament/numbers/bashan), and north of [Ammon](/places/old-testament/genesis/ammon).

- So called because when Jacob fled there from Laban (Gen. 31:25), they made a covenant and set up a stone pillar as a witness (Gen. 31:44-46). Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, which is Aramaic for "the heap of witness". Jacob called it Galeed (גַּלְעֵד) which is the Hebrew equivalent (Gen. 31:47). The city of [Mizpah](/places/old-testament/genesis/mizpah) (מִצְפָּה) is located there, which is Hebrew for "watchpost", as Laban said, "the Lord watch between you and me" (Gen. 31:48-49).
