- After Jacob dies in Egypt, Joseph carries his bones to [Machpelah](/places/old-testament/genesis/machpelah) as promised (Gen. 50:13-14). On the way, he and his brothers stop east of the [Jordan](/places/old-testament/genesis/jordan-river) at the threshing Floor of Atad (Gen. 50:10)—Atad (אָטָד) means "thornbush" or "bramble"—and they all weep for the death of their father (Gen. 50:11). The place is then named Abel-mizraim (אָבֵל מִצְרַיִם), which means "mourning (or meadow) of Egypt" (Gen. 50:11).
