- Shechem is north of [Bethel](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethel) and [Shiloh](/places/old-testament/genesis/shiloh), on the high road going from [Jerusalem](/places/old-testament/genesis/jerusalem) to the northern districts, in the land that became Manasseh, west of the [Jordan](/places/old-testament/genesis/jordan-river). It is located between [Mount Ebal](/places/old-testament/genesis/mount-ebal) to the north and [Mount Gerizim](/places/old-testament/genesis/mount-gerizim) to the south.

- Named after Schechem the son of Hamor the Hivite (Gen. 34:2).

- The Lord calls Abraham and he takes Sarah and Lot from [Haran](/places/old-testament/genesis/haran) down south into the land of [Canaan](/places/old-testament/genesis/canaan), and they pass through Schechem at the [Oak of Moreh](/places/old-testament/genesis/oak-of-moreh). The Lord appears to Abraham there and tells him that he will give him the land of Canaan. Then Abraham builds an altar to the Lord (Gen 12:5-7).

- After Jacob meets Esau, he stops in [Succoth](/places/old-testament/genesis/succoth) (Gen. 33:17), and then goes to Schechem where he buys some land and builds and altar to the Lord and calls it El-Elohe-Israel (Hebrew: אֵ֖ל אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל, "God, the God of Israel") (Gen. 33:19-20).

- To Jacob's dismay, Simeon and Levi kill all the males in the city and plunder it after Shechem son of Hamor defiles their sister Dinah (Gen. 34:25).

- There Jacob tells his family to put away their foreign gods and purify themselves (Gen. 35:2), and he hides their household idols under a terebinth tree (Gen. 35:4).

- Jacob's twelve sons (and perhaps Ephraim and Manasseh) are buried there (Ex. 1:5-6) (Josh. 24:32) (Acts 7:15-16).
