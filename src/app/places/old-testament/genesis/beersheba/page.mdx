- A place in the desert in the [Negeb](/places/old-testament/genesis/negeb) in what became the land of Simeon, east of [Gerar](/places/old-testament/genesis/gerar) and south of [Hebron](/places/old-testament/genesis/hebron).

- When Sarah sends Hagar and Ishmael away for mocking Isaac, she wanders there (Gen. 21:14). When she runs out of water and thinks she and Ishmael will die, the angel of God comforts her and shows her a well of water (Gen. 21:19).

- Abraham built a well there that Abimelech's servants had seized (Gen. 21:25-26), but seeing that God was with Abraham, Abimelech sought to make a covenant with him (Gen. 21:22-23). Abraham sets apart seven ewe lambs from his flock as a witness that he dug the well, and Abraham and Abimelech make an oath there, thus the name of the place is called Beersheba ("well of seven" or "well of the oath") (Gen. 21:29-31).

- Abraham plants a tamarisk tree there, and calls on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God (Gen. 21:33).

- After God tests Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his only son Isaac on [Mount Moriah](/places/old-testament/genesis/mount-moriah), he goes and lives in Beersheba (Gen. 22:19).

- After Abraham had died, the Philistines filled up the well that Abraham had dug there (Gen. 26:15), but Isaac digs it again (Gen. 26:18).

- The Lord appears to Isaac there and reaffirms his promise that he will bless him and multiply his offspring. Isaac then builds an altar there. (Gen. 26:23-25).

- Seeing that God was with Isaac, Abimelech makes a covenant with him there (Gen. 26:26-28).

- Jacob stops there on the way to Egypt, and the Lord speaks to him in a vision and tells him that he will protect him on his journey and bring him back to the land in safety (Gen. 46:1-4).
