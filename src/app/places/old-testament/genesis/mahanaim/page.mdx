- A city along the [Jabbok River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jabbok-river), east of [Peniel](/places/old-testament/genesis/peniel) in [Gilead](/places/old-testament/genesis/gilead).

- Mahanaim (מַחֲנַיִם, Maḥănayīm) means "two camps" in Hebrew.

- When Jacob arrives there, the angels of God meet him, and he says, "This is God's camp!" (Gen. 32:1-2). Jacob then divides his camp in two when he finds out Esau is on his way with 400 men (Gen. 32:6-8).
