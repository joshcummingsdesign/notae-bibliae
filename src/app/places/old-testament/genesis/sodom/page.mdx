- Located in the Jordon Valley, the lower course of the [Jordan River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jordan-river), just east of the [Dead Sea](/places/old-testament/genesis/dead-sea) in the southern region. North of [Gomorrah](/places/old-testament/genesis/gomorrah).

- When Abraham and Lot separate, Lot heads towards [Zoar](/places/old-testament/genesis/zoar) because the Jordan Valley is rich in natural resources. Lot ends up in Sodom, just north of Gomorrah. The men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord. (Gen 13:10-13).

- God destroys Sodom, Gomorrah, [Admah](/places/old-testament/genesis/admah), and [Zeboiim](/places/old-testament/genesis/zeboiim) for their great sin (Gen. 19:23-25) (Deut. 29:23).
