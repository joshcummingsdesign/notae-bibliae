- Babylonia, also called Shinar, was an ancient state in central-southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq and parts of Iran and Syria) that included the city of [Ur](/places/old-testament/genesis/ur) in the region of [Chaldea](/places/old-testament/genesis/chaldea), and the city of [Babylon](/places/old-testament/genesis/babylon).

- Shinab king of Admah is one of the five kings that Amraphel king of Shinar (Babylonia) wars with in the time of Abraham (Gen. 14:1). Lot gets captured, and Abraham rescues him with just 318 men (Gen. 14:14-16).
