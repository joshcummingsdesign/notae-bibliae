- Also called the Salt Sea or the Valley of Siddim, the Dead Sea is a landlocked salt lake near southeast Israel into which the [Jordan River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jordan-river) flows, so called because its high salinity prevents most aquatic life from surviving in it.

- Four mighty Babylonian kings (Gen. 14:1-2), war against five kings of the Jordan Valley (Gen. 14:8-9) at the Valley of Siddim (Gen. 14:3), and dispossess their land and capture Lot (Gen. 14:11-12).
