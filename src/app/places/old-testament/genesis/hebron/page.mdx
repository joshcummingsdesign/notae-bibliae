- Hebron, also called Kiriath-arba (Gen 23:2), is about 20 miles south of [Jerusalem](/places/old-testament/genesis/jerusalem) in the land that became Judah.

- After Abraham and Lot separate, Abraham goes from the place between [Bethel](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethel) and [Ai](/places/old-testament/genesis/ai) to Hebron and settles by the [Oaks of Mamre](/places/old-testament/genesis/oaks-of-mamre) and builds an altar to the Lord there (Gen 13:18).

- Abraham was visited by three angels at the Oaks of Mamre (Gen. 18:1-4) (cf. Gen. 19:1) (cf. Heb. 13:2).

- Abraham buys a burial site from Ephron the Hittite just east of the Oaks of Mamre at [Machpelah](/places/old-testament/genesis/machpelah) (Gen. 23:7-9).
