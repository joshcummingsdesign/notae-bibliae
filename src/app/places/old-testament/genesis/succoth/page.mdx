- East of the [Jordan River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jordan-river) and northwest of the [Jabbok River](/places/old-testament/genesis/jabbok-river), west of [Penuel](/places/old-testament/genesis/penuel).

- Jacob leaves Penuel and then sees Esau and his 400 men (Gen. 33:1). Although Jacob fears, Esau embraces him (Gen. 33:4). Esau goes back to [Seir](/places/old-testament/genesis/seir) (Gen. 33:16), and Jacob camps in Succoth (Hebrew: סוכות, Sukót, "booths") where he builds a house and booths for his livestock (Gen. 33:17).
