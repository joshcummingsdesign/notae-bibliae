- A city southwest of [Bethlehem](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethlehem) in the land that became Judah.

- After Joseph is sold to the  Ishmaelites, Judah befriends a man there named Hirah (Gen. 38:1). Then, Judah marries Bath-shua, the daughter of Shua the Canaanite, and has two sons: Er and Onan (Gen. 38:2-4).
