- Jerusalem (יְרוּשָׁלַיִם) contains two parts. The second part comes from the Hebrew word *shalem* (שלם), which means "peace" or "completeness". The first part may relate to a few different Hebrew words. The word *yireh* (יִרְאֶה) means "to see", or metaphorically to provide (Gen. 22:14). The word *yará* (ירה) can mean "to cast", "to shoot", "to rain", "to teach", "to lay down", or "to establish" (Gen. 31:51). The word *yaré* (ירא) means "to revere", "to fear", or "to stand in awe" (Gen. 3:10). Thus, Jerusalem means something akin to "Foundation of Peace" or "Awe of Completeness".

- Melchizedek (מַלְכִּי־צֶדֶק, "king of righteousness") was priest and king of Salem (שָׁלֵם, "peace") (Gen. 14:18) (cf. Ps. 76:2) (cf. Heb. 7:2).

- Jerusalem was originally inhabited by the Jebusites (Joshua 15:8).

- A hard city to capture as it is on a hill surrounded by three deep valleys: the [Kidron Valley](/places/old-testament/2-samuel/kidron) on the east, the [Valley of Hinnom](/places/old-testament/joshua/valley-of-hinnom) on the southwest, and the central Tyropoeon Valley. These three valleys converge in the vicinity of the [Gihon Spring](/places/old-testament/1-kings/gihon), southeast of Jerusalem. Looking at a map, these three valleys seem to form the Hebrew letter *shin* (ש), which is the first letter of the word *Shaddai* (שַׁדַּי), which means "Almighty". This is regarded a sacred letter among the Jews.

- [Mount Zion](/places/old-testament/2-samuel/mount-zion) lies to the west, [Mount Moriah](/places/old-testament/genesis/mount-moriah) is central, and the [Mount of Olives](/places/old-testament/2-samuel/mount-of-olives) lies to the east.
