- Located about six miles south of [Jerusalem](/places/old-testament/genesis/jerusalem).

- Bethlehem (בֵּית לֶחֶם, bēṯ lɛ́ḥɛm) means "house of bread" in Hebrew.

- Also called Ephrath (Hebrew: אֶפְרָת, "fruitful") (Gen. 35:19).

- On the way from [Bethel](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethel) to Bethlehem, Rachel has a hard labor (Gen. 35:16-17). She dies giving birth to Benjamin, and is buried on the way (Gen. 35:18-19). Jacob sets up a pillar over her tomb (Gen. 35:20).

- Israel pitches his tent there beyond the [Tower of Eder](/places/old-testament/genesis/tower-of-eder) (Hebrew: עֵדֶר), which means "Tower of the Flock" (Gen. 35:21) (cf. Mic. 4:8).
