- The angel of the Lord visits Hagar there when she flees from Sarah (Gen. 16:6-8), thus it was named Beer-lahai-roi which means "well of the Living One who sees me". It lies between [Kadesh](/places/old-testament/genesis/kadesh-barnea) and [Shur](/places/old-testament/genesis/shur) (Gen. 16:13-14).

- Isaac settles there after Abraham dies (Gen. 25:11).
