- A place about a mile south of [Bethlehem](/places/old-testament/genesis/bethlehem).

- The [Tower of Eder](/places/old-testament/genesis/tower-of-eder) (Hebrew: עֵדֶר) means "Tower of the Flock" (Mic. 4:8).

- Jacob camped there after Rachel had died giving birth to Benjamin (Gen. 35:19-21).

- Tradition holds this is where the shepherds were watching their flock by night when the angel of the Lord appeared to them (Luke 2:8-9).
