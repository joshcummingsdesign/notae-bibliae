- Dothan is north of [Shechem](/places/old-testament/genesis/shechem) in the land that became Manasseh.

- Joseph finds his brothers pasturing the flock here, all of them but Reuben (and Benjamin who is too young) throw him in a pit and sell him to the Ishmaelites who take him to Egypt (Gen. 37:16-18).
