- A city in Upper Mesopotamia (modern southeastern Turkey).

- Also called Paddan-aram (Hebrew: פַּדָּן אֲרָם, "the field of Aram"), which is named after Aram, the son of Shem (Gen. 10:22). The term "Aramean" is derived from his name (Gen. 25:20).

- Haran (חָרָן) the place is spelled differently than the name of Abraham's brother Haran (הָרָן) (Gen. 11:26).

- Terah takes Abraham, Sarah, and Lot up from [Ur](/places/old-testament/genesis/ur) to go to [Canaan](/places/old-testament/genesis/canaan), but they settle in Haran (Gen. 11:31). Later, Abraham takes Sarah and Lot to Canaan (Gen. 12:5).

- Terah, Abraham's father, dies there (Gen. 11:32).

- Abraham sends his servant Eliezer there (Gen. 15:2), and he arrives at the city of Abraham's brother Nahor to find a wife for Isaac (Gen. 24:2-4) (Gen. 24:10). There he meets Rebekah (Gen. 24:15).

- When Esau looks to kill Jacob, Rebekah sends Jacob there to her brother Laban (Gen. 27:43). Before he leaves, Isaac and Rebekah tell him not to intermarry with the Canaanites, but to take a wife from the land of their kindred (Gen. 27:43) (Gen. 27:46) (Gen. 28:1-2).
