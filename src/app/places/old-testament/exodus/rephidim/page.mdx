- Rephidim (רְפִידִים)—meaning 'props', 'supports', or 'rests'—is located Between the [Wilderness of Sin](/places/old-testament/exodus/wilderness-of-sin) and [Mount Sinai](/places/old-testament/exodus/mount-sinai).

- After Moses and the Israelites receive bread from heaven in the Wilderness of Sin, they camp there, and there is no water for the people to drink (Ex. 17:1). The people grumble against Moses, testing the Lord (Ex. 17:2-4), and the Lord tells him to go to the rock at [Horeb](/places/old-testament/exodus/mount-sinai) and the Lord will stand before him. The Lord tells Moses to strike the rock. Moses does so, and water comes out of it and the people drink (Ex. 17:5-6). The place is then called [Massah and Meribah](/places/old-testament/exodus/massah-and-meribah) (מַסָּה וּמְרִיבָה) which means 'testing and quarreling' in Hebrew (Ex. 17:7).

- The Amalekites come to fight against the Israelites there (Ex. 17:8). Joshua leads Israel in battle (Ex. 17:9-10), and the Israelites prevail when Moses lifts up his hands (Ex. 17:11). Aaron and Hur put a stone under Moses and lift up his hands when he grows weary, and hold them up until the setting of the sun (Ex. 17:12). The Israelites defeat the Amalekites (Ex. 17:13). Moses builds an altar there called 'The Lord Is My Banner' (Hebrew: יְהֹוָה נִסִּי, Adonai Nissi), and the Lord declares that the Amalekites will be devoted to destruction (Ex. 17:14-6).
