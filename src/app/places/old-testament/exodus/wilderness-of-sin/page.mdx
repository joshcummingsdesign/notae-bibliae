- Wilderness region between [Elim](/places/old-testament/exodus/elim) and [Mount Sinai](/places/old-testament/exodus/mount-sinai).

- The name is not a reference to 'sin', but rather a geographical term.

- On the 15th day of the second month after Moses and the Israelites depart from [Egypt](/places/old-testament/genesis/egypt), they arrive there and the Israelites start to grumble against Moses and Aaron saying that they wish they had died in Egypt for now they were to die hungry in the wilderness (Ex. 16:1-3). The Lord then gives them manna—bread from heaven—and quail (Ex. 16:12-14) (Ex. 16:31). From this, the Israelites are to learn gratitude, humility, and strict obedience to the Lord (Ex. 16:27-30).
