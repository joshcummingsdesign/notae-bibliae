- A mountain on the Sinai Peninsula which is sometimes called Mount Horeb because it is in the region of Horeb (Hebrew: חֹרֵב, 'desert').

- Moses was keeping Jethro's flock here, and the angel of the Lord appears to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush (Ex. 3:1-2). God tells Moses he will deliver the Israelites from Egypt, and that they will return to Mt. Sinai to serve God (Ex. 3:10-12).

- Fifty days (7 weeks or 'week of weeks', inclusive counting) after the Passover, Moses and the Israelites leave [Rephidim](/places/old-testament/exodus/rephidim) and camp before Mt. Sinai (Ex. 19:1-2). God tells Moses if Israel keeps his covenant, they will be a nation of priests and a holy nation (Ex. 19:3-6). On the third day, the Lord descends in fire in the sight of all the people to give them the Law (Ex. 19:10-11) (Ex. 19:16-20) (Ex. 19:24-25) (Ex. 20:1-2) (Ex. 20:18-21) (Ex. 24:1-3) (Deut. 5:22). Then Moses builds an altar and twelve pillars there (Ex. 24:4), and Israel makes a covenant with God using the sign of blood (Ex. 24:5-8). Moses and the priests behold the Lord and partake of the sacrifices before him (Ex. 24:9-11).
