- Just east of the northern part of the [Red Sea](/places/old-testament/exodus/red-sea), and south of [Marah](/places/old-testament/exodus/marah).

- After Moses and the Israelites cross the Red Sea, they come to Marah where they have to water to drink because it is bitter. The Lord makes the water sweet for them, and tells them that if they keep his commands, he will be their healer. Then they come to Elim where there are twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees (Ex. 15:26-27).
