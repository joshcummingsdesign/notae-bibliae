- A sea inlet of what we now call the Indian Ocean, just west of the [Sinai Peninsula](/places/old-testament/exodus/mount-sinai).

- The Lord parts the Red Sea when he tells Moses to lift his staff, and the Israelites cross on dry ground (Ex. 14:21-22). The Egyptians pursue them, but the Lord throws them into the midst of the sea (Ex. 14:26-27).
