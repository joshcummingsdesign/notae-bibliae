- In [Rephidim](/places/old-testament/exodus/rephidim) between the [Wilderness of Sin](/places/old-testament/exodus/wilderness-of-sin) and [Mount Sinai](/places/old-testament/exodus/mount-sinai).

- After Moses and the Israelites receive bread from heaven in the Wilderness of Sin, they camp at Rephidim, and there is no water for the people to drink (Ex. 17:1). The people grumble against Moses, testing the Lord (Ex. 17:2-4), and the Lord tells him to go to the rock at [Horeb](/places/old-testament/exodus/mount-sinai) and the Lord will stand before him. The Lord tells Moses to strike the rock. Moses does so, and water comes out of it and the people drink (Ex. 17:5-6). The place is then called [Massah and Meribah](/places/old-testament/exodus/massah-and-meribah) (מַסָּה וּמְרִיבָה) which means 'testing and quarreling' in Hebrew (Ex. 17:7).
