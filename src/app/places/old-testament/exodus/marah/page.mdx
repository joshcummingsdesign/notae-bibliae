- Just east of the northernmost part of the [Red Sea](/places/old-testament/exodus/red-sea).

- Marah (Hebrew: מָרָה, mará) means 'bitterness'.

- After Moses and the Israelites cross the Red Sea, they come to Marah and they cannot drink the water because it is bitter. The people grumbles against Moses, and the Lord gives him the sign of a log which makes the water sweet (Ex. 15:23-25).
