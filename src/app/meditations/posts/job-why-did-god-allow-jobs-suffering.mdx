Satan wants to harm Job because that's what Satan does. He wants us to believe in half-truths so we rebel like him. Satan makes the claim to God that Job will lose faith and give in if he is tested, because more often than not that's what humans do, and that's what Satan wants. God is so confident in Job's faith, that he accepts the challenge. God knows that the righteous live by their faith, i.e. that Satan has no power over the faithful. What's the best way to illustrate this? Allowing Satan to do his work on one of God's faithful servants, knowing the faithful servant will overcome it and live by his faith. Additionally, when God restores him back twofold, it magnifies God's sovereignty, grace, and mercy, and shows that Satan had no real power to begin with. When we pray for God to deliver us from evil, we are in a sense praying that God give us faith like Job. To be like Job is easier said than done, but the righteous live by their faith.
