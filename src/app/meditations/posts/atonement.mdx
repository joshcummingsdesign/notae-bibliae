The word <Definition lang="english" anchor="atonement" text="atonement" /> literally means "at-one-ment", referring to reconciliation with God or the restoration of a harmonious relationship with him. There are several perspectives on how Christ atoned for our sins on the cross, but here are three key views.

## Christ the Victor

Christ disarmed the powers of evil on the cross and gave us eternal hope in his victory over death.

## Moral Influence

Christ showed us the effects of our sin on the cross while simultaneously offering his entire self in the service of God as an act of self-giving love for us and for the Father.

## Satisfaction

We were in a debt of sin, and were to bear our iniquity, but Christ bore our iniquity on the cross and freed us of our debts, thus freeing us from slavery to sin.

## Takeaway

> "Jesus Christ did what you and I have not done, that is, he never gave into temptation. But when he died on the cross…he didn't just do it as an example, he did it for us. And just as when David slew Goliath, it wasn't just David's victory, but it was the victory of all those for whom he was standing as champion. So that all the Israelites partook in the victory of David over Goliath. So when you receive Christ as your savior, what does that mean? It means God now treats you as if you had spent all of your life resisting [temptation]. He loves you and accepts you as if you had done it all right."
