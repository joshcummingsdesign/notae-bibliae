To love God and to love others is to be vulnerable.

> "To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."

We can't force others to let us into their hearts any which way we choose. They determine the way.

God determined His way through Christ Jesus. And to love the Father through Jesus takes complete surrender.
