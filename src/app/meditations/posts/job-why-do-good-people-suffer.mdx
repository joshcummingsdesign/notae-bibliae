## 1. The Book of Job's Main Question

The main question that Job has in the book is, **"Why do good people suffer?"**

In the beginning, Satan flips this question on its head by asking, **"Why do good people prosper?"** The claim being that a policy of reward can lead us to do things out of selfishness.

## 2. The Main Characters' Claims

The main characters of the story debate three fundamental claims, only two of which can be true at the same time:

1. **God is just and good**
2. **God enforces the retribution principle**
3. **Job is made to suffer though he is innocent**

The friends argue #1 and #2 are true, therefore Job must have sinned.

Job knows #3 is true, therefore Job wonders if #2 is false, or even worse #1 is false.

## 3. God's Response

God's response implies three things.

1. **To make the claim that God is unjust is to claim that you have the same level of perspective God has, which is plainly false.**

- Think about a child seeing their parent break a window. The child thinks the parent has done something wrong, but the parent knows there is a fire and the window is the only way out.

2. **If God were to enact retribution in every single situation, there would be no room for growth and change.**

- Think about a parent punishing their child for every single mistake they make.

3. **Suffering is not always caused by evil.**

- Think of a knife. A knife can cut you and cause suffering, but that doesn't mean the knife is inherently evil. It is actually a useful tool.

## 3. The Conclusion

Constant reward can corrupt our motives, but constant retribution can inhibit our growth. Like most things in life, suffering is not so black and white. When we search for reasons for suffering, we either simplify God or accuse him based on limited evidence. God invites us to bring our pain and grief to him, and to trust that he cares and that he knows what he is doing.
