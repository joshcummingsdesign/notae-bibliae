## Context

Paul is writing to both Jewish and Gentile Christians in the church of Rome from Corinth soon after the Jews began to return to Rome after being expelled by Roman emperor Claudius. Paul is looking to address the tension between the Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus, as well as expound upon in detail the theology of the gospel. He has just finished explaining that though our sin increased, God's grace through Christ abounded all the more.

## Romans 6

"What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?" (Rom. 6:1).

This is a great question. Are we to put God to the test by sinning that we may further experience his grace? Paul answers directly.

"By no means!" (Rom. 6:2).

Then, Paul takes it even further.

"How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?" (Rom. 6:2-3).

When we accept Christ's death on the cross as our own, we die to sin and live for him. Paul will further explain what it means to die to sin, so hang on if this is still fuzzy.

"We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his" (Rom. 6:4-5).

The Christian story is all about unity. We are united with Christ in his death. But the story didn't end on the cross. Jesus was raised to life and glorified. So too we are united with Christ in his resurrection. We are reborn and sanctified by the Spirit, that we may walk in newness of life unto the age to come where we will be united with God eternally. But why do we still battle sin in this age? We'll look at this more in Romans 7.

"We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin" (Rom. 6:6).

Christ's atoning death disarmed the powers of evil and gave us eternal hope in his victory over death. Christ showed us the effects of our sin on the cross while simultaneously offering his entire self in the service of God as an act of self-giving love for us and for the Father. We were in a debt of sin, and were to bear our iniquity, but Christ bore our iniquity on the cross and freed us of our debts. Dying with Christ means we are freed from slavery to sin. Paul will further explain slavery to sin in Romans 7.

The ESV Study Bible says that "the body of sin" means "the rule [or reign] of sin, but without excluding the involvement of the personal self that lives through the body."[^1]

"For one who has died has been set free from sin" (Rom. 6:7).

Sin cannot hold us in death, thus dying with Christ means freedom from the bonds of sin.

"Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him" (Rom. 6:8-9).

We don't just accept his death, but his resurrection, which means eternal life. "'O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?'" (1 Cor. 15:55) (Hos. 13:14).

"For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace" (Rom. 6:10-14).

Christ lived completely for God, laid his life down to sin for us, then was raised to live for God eternally. Accepting his death as our own means that we too died to sin and live for God eternally. Thus, we are to be living sacrifices unto God through Christ, ministering to others with joy in our hearts as ones brought from death to life. "I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship" (Rom. 12:1). But what does Paul mean that we are not under the law? Are not God's laws righteous and holy and good? Rest assured, Paul will address this in Romans 7.

"What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace?" (Rom. 6:15).

Another great question that echoes what he said in verse 1. He again answers directly, and again takes it further.

"By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed" (Rom. 6:15-17).

Accepting Christ's death means we also accept his Lordship. Being freed from slavery to sin, we become servants of righteousness. This is a transformation at the heart level; a circumcision of the heart (Deut. 10:16) (Ezek. 36:27). With the Spirit of God in us, we abide in the law of love.

Calvin says, "Christ inwardly forms our souls in a better way, than when the law constrains them by threatening and terrifying us…He does not indeed allow his people unbridled freedom, that they might frisk about without any restraint, like horses let loose in the fields; but he brings them to a regular course of life." About "the standard of teaching" he says, "It seems indeed to me to denote the formed image or impress of that righteousness which Christ engraves on our hearts" ([Calvin on Romans 6:17](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom38/calcom38.x.vi.html#x.vi-p31)).

"And, having been set free from sin, [you] have become slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. (Rom. 6:18-21).

While living a lawless life, we were "free in regard to righteousness" in the sense that we didn't fully grasp the implications of sin and its end, death.

"But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom. 6:22-23).

By our own might we strive and strive, and never seem to escape from sin, but in Christ we can lay down our burdens and rest in him as Lord, and in the process we are sanctified and bear fruit for God. His love and grace abound and overflow in us that we may take it into the world and do the works that proceed from faith. This is the free gift of God in Christ. "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matt. 11:28-30). Praise God.

## Romans 7

Now we look at slavery to sin in more detail, and revisit the question of why Paul said we aren't under the law. Are not God's laws righteous and holy and good? Are we not to follow them as part of the covenant with God?

"Or do you not know, brothers—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives?" (Rom. 7:1).

Remember that earlier Paul said that we died to sin and the law. But what does it mean to die to the law? He starts with an analogy.

"For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage. Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress" (Rom. 7:2-3).

Transgressing the law while under God's covenant makes us akin to an unfaithful spouse (Hos 1:2). But when we die, we are no longer bound by the law.

"Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God" (Rom. 7:4).

When we die with Christ, we are freed from both our unbridled sin and our striving to do the law by our own might. When we are reborn, we accept Christ's Lordship, and we become part of a new covenant, a covenant of grace. We become part of God's family through Christ. Since Christ is the Law, we belong to a new law, as it were, the law of love. It's not that the old law doesn't matter. The old law points to him, for he is the Law. Thus, when we see him for who he is, we begin to truly follow the Law, for we follow him. We follow him because we love him, thus we begin to truly love the Law for the first time. This is all so that his love may abound in us and overflow unto others. This is the fruit: the works that proceed from faith. (James 1:25).

"For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death" (Rom. 7:5).

Before we were reborn, we allowed the passions to control us. Concupiscence ruled over our lives, and the fruit that it bears is death. But in striving by our own might to live righteously we arrive at something unsettling, trying harder doesn't save us from sin and death. Striving, In fact, either arouses the passions and exacerbates our temptations, or makes us self-righteous, feeling as though we are better than our neighbor for being so much more "virtuous" than they. In both cases, covetousness rears its ugly head. So what do we do? Are we stuck forever bearing the fruit of death? Paul answers.

"But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code" (Rom. 7:6).

By dying to the law in Christ we are no longer under the heavy burden of written code. We are set free from our striving and rest in him as Lord; and a righteous Lord he is. We are then born again, receiving the Holy Spirit which sanctifies us and works inwardly to transform our lives, always pointing us to God's truth. The Lord's mercy then so moves us that we no longer see the law as a heavy burden, but as a way to please the one who died for us.

"What then shall we say? That the law is sin?" (Rom. 7:7).

The question ultimately comes up, if the law stirs up our temptations and leaves us condemned, does that mean the law is bad? Paul again answers directly, and again takes it further.

"By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not covet." But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness" (Rom. 7:7-8).

Did you catch that? It's not the law, it's sin. The law is holy and good, but sin causes us to want to transgress the law. Paul gives the example of coveting. Coveting is the essence of sin. It's when deep down we want something more than God. Before Paul met Jesus on the road to Damascus, he coveted the law. He persecuted Christians in the name of the law to feel righteous and holy and good. But what was he doing? He was ultimately persecuting Christ. So sin seizing an opportunity turned the law into a carnal desire to be right, even over and above God in the flesh.

"For apart from the law, sin lies dead. I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died. The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me" (Rom. 7:8-10).

When we don't know the law (and knowing doesn't just mean intellectually, for Paul knew the law better than anyone—knowing means God shines a light on the sin in our heart), sin lies dead in the sense that we don't fully grasp the implications of what it is that we're doing. But when God shines a light on the sin in our heart, we see and understand what we've done, and we are convicted. This slays us to the very heart. Paul then summarizes this point.

"For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good" (Rom. 7:11-12).

The law is good. Sin is what deceives us into transgression. And when God shows us our sin, it slays us to the very heart.

"Did that which is good, then, bring death to me?" (Rom. 7:13).

Another great question. So, since the law brings to light all that is evil within us and condemns us, does that make it bad? Paul again answers directly, and again takes it further.

"By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure" (Rom. 7:13).

Sin takes what is good, e.g. the law, and deceives us into using it for all sorts of evil (Gen. 3:1-6). When God shines a light on our sin through the law, it convicts us; then because of our sinful nature stirs up our temptations.

"For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate" (Rom. 7:14-15).

Still don't understand what it means to be a slave to sin? Think about this: no matter how hard we try, and no matter how much we know what is good, we still end up doing the very thing that we hate. Why is that? It is because we are slaves to our passions. We are "of the flesh, sold under sin". Paul says something else profound here: that the law is spiritual. When we see the law carnally, it produces in us all sorts of temptation, doubts, shame, condemnation, misunderstanding, and self-righteousness. But when the Holy Spirit reveals to us the spiritual truth behind the law, God removes the veil of misunderstanding within our hearts, and we see how Christ is the fulfillment of it. We are then so moved by his grace that we begin to delight in the law of God in our inner being.

"Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good" (Rom. 7:16).

Paul drives home the point that the law is holy and good. If we agree that what we are doing is wrong, then we agree that God's law is good. But why do we do the very thing we hate?

"So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me" (Rom. 7:17-20).

We desire to do what is right, but we end up doing what we hate. Why? Because of our sinful nature ("the flesh"). When we chose life apart from God, we corrupted our very nature. When we abused free will and turned away from God, we became irreparably broken, unable to save ourselves. This was instantiated through the generations and lives in us to this day. This is original sin: life apart from God. This explains why striving isn't the solution, and why striving just makes the problem worse. Striving is continuing to choose a life apart from God. It's refusing to acknowledge we need his grace and mercy. This is why Paul says that we have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. We want to live a life reconciled to God—that is the desire—but we have not the ability to save ourselves from the mess we've created because we were never designed to live a life apart from God in the first place. The harder we try, the more we fail. Who then will reconcile us to God if we are incapable of doing it ourselves? We need a savior. The good news is that God offers us salvation as a free gift in Christ Jesus, who died to sin that we may live for God. We live for God because through Christ we are in his family. We'll explore this more in Romans 8.

"So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members" (Rom. 7:21-23).

Paul recognizes that when he wants to do good, evil lies close at hand. The more good he tries to do, the more he feels evil breathing down his neck. The enemy doesn't want us to do good because then he doesn't get to win. And we are incapable of doing good apart from God. This is important to remember in our walk. When we look to do good, evil is crouching at the door. Its desire is contrary to us, but we must rule over it (Gen. 4:7). We don't, however, rule over it by might, but through Christ. But how do we rule over it through Christ? Paul gives us the answer.

"Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!" (Rom. 7:24).

Paul's answer has three parts: 1. We confess the sin that's in our hearts and turn to God in repentance; 2. We recognize our need for a savior; 3. We find our savior in Christ, give him his due Lordship, and live a life of gratitude for his salvation. This changes everything. We then move from fighting a battle we can't win, to fighting a battle we can't lose. Why? Because it's no longer we who fight for ourselves, but the Lord who fights for us by grace. Paul then concludes by summarizing his main point.

"So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin" (Rom. 7:24).

We have the desire to do God's will, but not the ability to carry it out. In Christ we die to the flesh and the law and are reborn in the Spirit to his Lordship. We then become instruments of righteousness bearing fruit for God. The fruit is the works that proceed from faith. Then, we don't just desire the law, but we love the law because he is the law. So the law becomes a way to please the one who died for us to be free eternally. We may still stumble and fall because we are still in the body. But we are now fighting a battle we can't lose because it's no longer we who fight, but the Spirit that lives within us. Praise God.

## Romans 8:1-17

"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1).

What does it mean that there is no condemnation for those in Christ? Well, what happens when we die to the law and live for Christ? We are freed from the law which once held us to a standard we could never reach by our own might, and from under which we could never escape its crushing burden. That road led only to condemnation. Now, as a member of God's family through Christ, we are forgiven, loved, supported, and guided as we walk with him day by day in this age unto the age to come. We have an advocate in Christ with the Father, and a helper and a teacher in the Holy Spirit. While we may be convicted at times, we are never condemned when we are in God's family through Christ. God loves his family perfectly, and keeps them on the right path.

"For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death" (Rom. 8:2).

The Holy Spirit delivers unto us a new law, as it were, the law of love and freedom, always pointing us to the truth of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

"For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do" (Rom. 8:3).

When we turned God's law into something carnal, when we turned it into prideful striving, we continued the human pattern of enmity towards God. Thus, the law could never change or save us. So, God acted. What did he do?

"By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh" (Rom 8:3).

God became man. And he became man not only to bear our sufferings and teach us the way, but he himself became the sin offering to make atonement. There are so many layers of beautiful meaning here. In the flesh Jesus lived a sinless life, thus condemning sin in the flesh; in the flesh Jesus exposed sin by allowing it to stir up and kill him, thus condemning sin in the flesh; Jesus was raised from the dead, showing us that in the end sin in the flesh is condemned, and that the righteousness of God triumphs over all.

"…in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit" (Rom. 8:4).

When we accept his death as our own, we receive the Holy Spirit forever in order that we may become instruments of righteousness (John 14:16). Thus, the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled, not by us, but by him who strengthens us.

"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God" (Rom. 8:5-8).

It's not only that because of our sin nature we do not submit to God, it's that we cannot. Now we see the battle of those in Christ Jesus. When we set our mind on the flesh—the remnant of covetousness that remains in us as the Holy Spirit works to sanctify us—we will never win. When we set our mind on the Spirit—putting him first and foremost in our lives, listening to him intently, not taking our eyes off of him for even a moment—we will never lose; not because of our own doing, but because we stop living for ourselves and start living for him who died for us to be free eternally. That's life and peace.

"You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you" (Rom. 8:9-11).

The Holy Spirit not only sanctifies us, he is the sign and seal that we belong to Christ. He is also the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, thus he gives us everlasting life. He saves us from this body of death.

"So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh" (Rom. 8:12)

When we accept Christ and receive the Holy Spirit, we are no longer debtors of sin, but of the one who saved us from sin. Thus, we live as servants of the Lord giving all Lordship to him.

"For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live" (Rom. 8:13).

The Holy Spirit puts to death the law of sin within us. The putting to death of sin is eternal life.

"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God" (Rom. 8:14).

It cannot be overstated that the Holy Spirit is the sign and seal that we are in the family of God through Christ. There is no more condemnation under the law, but rather the Father gives us an Advocate that we may experience eternal life unto the age to come, sharing in the very life of God.

"For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!' The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God" (Rom. 8:15-16).

The Holy Spirit doesn't make us fearful slaves, but rather faithful sons. God becomes our Father through Christ. And our Father loves perfectly (Matt. 5:48).

"…and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him" (Rom. 8:17).

As children of God through Christ we share in Christ's inheritance. What is that inheritance? Eternal life with God. Notice, however, that Christ never says we will be without suffering in this age. He does say, however, that when we endure the suffering by his grace, remembering how he has suffered for us, remaining faithful, recognizing his Lordship, listening to the Holy Spirit, that we will be glorified in the age to come. We share in his suffering that we may share in his glory. Not by our might, but by his grace. Praise God.
