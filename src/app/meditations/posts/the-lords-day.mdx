## Time

To appreciate the beauty and the significance of the Lord's Day, let us first explore time more broadly.

> **"And God said, 'Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years, and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.' And it was so."**

### Solstice

A **solstice** is when the days are either the longest or shortest in the year. This happens in the summer (estival solstice — longest day) and winter (hibernal solstice — shortest day). These events mark the first days of summer and winter respectively.

### Equinox

An **equinox** is when the days and nights are of equal length. This happens in the spring (vernal equinox) and fall (autumnal equinox). These events mark the first days of spring and fall respectively.

### Solar Calendar

In a **solar calendar**, years are based on "solar years" or "tropical years" (the time it takes for the sun to orbit the earth).

### Lunar Calendar

In a **lunar calendar**, months are based on "lunar months" or "synodic months" (the time between successive new moons, i.e. from new moon to full moon to new moon).

### Lunisolar Calendar

A **lunisolar calendar** accounts for lunar months and solar years.

### Metonic Cycle

Lunar months are about 29.5 days long, and there are 12 lunar months in a year, so there are 354 days in a lunar year (29.5 x 12 = 354). Solar years are about 365 days long. That means there are 11 days per year that need to be reconciled in a lunisolar calendar. Every 19 years, however, the lunar months and solar years synchronize. This synchronization is called the **Metonic Cycle**.

## The Hebrew Calendar

**The Hebrew Calendar** is a lunisolar calendar.

### Hours

In ancient Israel, days were divided into 12 hours from sunrise to sunset (John 11:9). For example, sunrise started the first hour, the sixth hour was around noon (John 19:14), and the 11th hour was right before the sun started setting (Matt. 20:6). There were three times of prayer throughout the day (Ps. 55:17) (Dan. 6:10), around the third hour (Ps. 88:13) (Acts 2:15), sixth hour (Acts 10:9), and ninth hour (Acts 3:1). Nights were divided into three watches (Ps. 63:6), a military term used for night watchmen who watched over the camp (Judg. 7:19) (2 Sam. 18:24).

### Days

New **days** in the Jewish mind begin at sundown, and one works out of rest. The name of each day is just the number of the day in the week, e.g. "first day", "second day", etc.

### Weeks

God ordained that each **week** there be six days of work and one of rest (Gen. 2:3).

### The Sabbath

The word **<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shabbat" text="Sabbath" />** comes from the Hebrew word for "rest" and happens every week on the seventh day. The Sabbath also represents trust (Ex. 16:27-28) and liberation from bondage (Deut. 5:15).

### Adar

The postexilic name for the last month of the year in the Hebrew Calendar is **Adar**, which aptly means "darkened" because it occurs in the winter. To reconcile the 11-day difference between the lunar year and solar year, an extra leap month (Adar II) is added to the calendar seven times during the 19-year Metonic Cycle (years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19).

### Abib

**Abib** is the first month of the year in the Hebrew calendar and is marked by the Passover (Ex. 12:2). It occurs in the spring. Abib means "barley ripening", which is how the ancient Israelites determined the start of spring. Abib's postexilic name is Nisan, which means "to bud" (Song 2:12).

### Paschal Full Moon

Passover begins at sundown on the 14th of Abib, which technically begins the day of the 15th (Ex. 12:6). This coincides with the first full moon after the spring equinox. The first full moon after the spring equinox is called the **<Definition lang="latin" anchor="paschalis" text="paschal full moon" />**.

## The Lord's Day

The resurrection of Jesus (the celebration of which we call Easter) occurred on the day after a very special Sabbath that occurred during the week of Passover (John 19:31). Not only was it fitting that this was the first day of the week (John 20:1), but it marked a new spiritual "first" or "eighth" day of the week (Rev. 22:13). The "first" or "eighth" day represents new life and a superabundance of God's love and grace through Christ. Thus, the first day of the week is known as **the Lord's Day** (Rev. 1:10).

## The Roman Calendar

**The Roman Calendar** is a solar calendar which originally had ten months in a year and eight days in a week. The days of the week (and planets) were named after Roman gods.

In the early first century A.D., things began to shift toward a seven-day week, and eventually the Roman Calendar evolved into **the Julian Calendar**.

In 312, Roman emperor **Constantine** converted to Christianity, and in 313 he issued the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire. In 321, he formally established the seven-day week and made the Lord's Day an official holiday.

### Hours

The Romans also divided their days into 12 hours, but their nights were divided into 12 hours (Acts 23:23) or four watches (Matt. 14:25).

### Sunday and Saturday

Romance languages preserved the Latin names for the days of the week, except for the names of **Sunday**, which was replaced by *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="dominica" text="Dominica" />*, that is, "the Lord's Day" (the first day of the week), and of **Saturday**, which was replaced by *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="sabbatum" text="Sabbatum" />*, that is, "the Sabbath" (the seventh day of the week).

### Easter

In 325 **the Council of Nicaea** decreed that **Easter** should be observed on the first Sunday after the paschal full moon. This date was approximated as March 21st. The Julian Calendar, however, incorrectly calculated a solar year as 365 1⁄4 days with leap years every four years, so by the 16th century, the spring equinox shifted about 10 days, from about March 21 to about March 11.

## The Gregorian Calendar

In 1545, **the Council of Trent** authorized **Pope Paul III** to reform the calendar. In 1582, **Pope Gregory XIII** instituted **the Gregorian Calendar**, which is the calendar we use today. The Gregorian Calendar calculates a solar year as 365 97⁄400 days with leap years every four years except for years that are divisible by 100 unless the year is divisible by 400. The Gregorian Calendar is a solar calendar which marks a lunisolar event, Easter, which occurs on the first Sunday after the paschal full moon.

## The Lord's Day as the Fulfillment of the Sabbath

The heart of the Sabbath law is to follow God's pattern of six days of work and one of rest. It is to trust in God's will, and to trust that he will provide. It is to not become enslaved to work, and to not make work into an idol. It is to stop and reflect upon God's salvation and his word. The seventh day is about God looking upon his creation with joy as we rest in his presence.

All of this is and more is fulfilled in the observance of the Lord's Day, which represents our eternal rest in Christ, who on the "first" or "eighth" day gave us a superabundance of his love and grace. So let us rest on the Lord's Day and prepare our hearts and minds for the age to come, in which we will rest in God's presence more fully.
