**Q:** What is the Trinity?<br/>
**A:** The Trinity is a word we use to summarize how Jesus and his followers spoke about God in the Bible. The Bible tells us that there is one God (Deut. 6:4). Jesus tells us that he is the Son of God, and speaks of God as the Father (Matt. 16:15-17). Jesus promises that God will send the Holy Spirit to all who believe in him (John 14:15-17). The Bible tells us that the Son of God (also simply called "the Son") and the Holy Spirit were with God before Jesus came into the world, and even before the world was created (Gen. 1:1-2) (John 1:1-3) (John 17:24). Thus, we can see that there are three present realities or "persons" within the one God: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. When we come to know Jesus, we begin to understand that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all God. So we see that in the one God there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19) ([ST I, q. 30, a. 2, co., par. 3](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q30.A2.C.3)).

**Q:** But how can there be three persons in the one God?<br/>
**A:** God is the most complex being in the universe, so it's quite difficult to wrap our minds around him, but try this thought experiment. A statue is a being which is zero persons. You are a being who is one person. And God is a being who is three persons.

**Q:** I still don't understand.<br/>
**A:** Let's think of it this way. Just as you and two of your family members are three persons who share the one essence of human nature—that is, you are all human—so too, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three persons who share the one essence of the divine nature—that is, they are all God.

**Q:** I still don't understand.<br/>
**A:** Try this thought experiment. Imagine you are God the Father, and you haven't sent Jesus or the Holy Spirit into the world yet. In fact, you haven't even created the world yet. Now, think about yourself in your mind. That person in your mind is you, but is also distinct from you. It is an image of yourself in your mind. You and the image of you in your mind are two present realities within your one being. So too, the Son is called the "Image" (Col. 1:15) or "Word" (John 1:1) because like an image or a word he comes from the mind of the Father. Now imagine your love is a ray of light that travels from you to the image of you in your mind. Now there are three present realities within your one being: you, the image of you, and the light of your love. So too, the Holy Spirit is called "Love" ([ST I, q. 37, a. 1, co., par. 1](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q37.A1.C)) because he is shared between the Father and the Son ([ST I, q. 37, a. 2, s.c.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q37.A2.SC)), and he is promised to those who believe in Jesus (John 14:15-17). Now, God doesn't just know, he *is* Knowledge (Prov. 2:6), thus the Son is divine knowledge in person (John 1:14); and God doesn't just love, he *is* Love (1 John 4:8), thus the Holy Spirit is divine love in person (Rom. 5:5). The Father is the source from whom divine knowledge and love originate ([ST I, q. 33, a. 1, s.c.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q33.A1.SC)).

**Q:** I still don't understand.<br/>
**A:** It's completely normal not to understand the utter complexity and sheer magnitude of God. The more you get to know Jesus and the more you pray for the gift of understanding, the more he will show you over time. This is what we call walking with God.

**Q:** Why is God three persons?<br/>
**A:** We believe the universe comes from a source that is personal, and that within God himself there is a communion of persons, a communion of love. We believe that God had love within himself before he created the world (John 17:24), and indeed did not *need* to create the world ([ST I, q. 46, a. 1, co., par. 1](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q46.A1.C)), but out of an outpouring of his love, created the universe that we may share in his love and his very life (2 Peter 1:3-4). That communion of love has revealed itself to us (John 1:18).
