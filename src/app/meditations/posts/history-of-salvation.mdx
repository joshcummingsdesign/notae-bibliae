## In the Beginning

God, who is Father, Son, and Spirit, is abounding in steadfast love within himself, and needs nothing to be content in the fullest, but in an outpouring of his love, he creates the heavens and the earth. He does so *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="ex-nihilo" text="ex nihilo" />*.

God also creates the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="seraphim" text="seraphim" />, <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="keruvim" text="cherubim" />, <Definition lang="greek" anchor="angelos" text="angels" />, and the whole host of heaven. God gives these beings free will, that they may know love and trust.

## Day 1

- God creates the waters and the earth beneath them.
- God shines his light into the darkness.

## Day 2

- God separates the waters above and below and the heavens emerge in between.

## Day 3

- God separates the waters below the heavens, which he calls the seas, and it reveals the earth beneath the waters.
- God makes the earth sprout vegetation.

## Day 4

- God commissions the sun, moon, and stars to give light and to order time.

## Day 5

- God creates the creatures of the sky (birds) and the creatures of the seas (fish).

## Day 6

- God creates the creatures of the earth (animals).
- God creates man and woman in his image and blesses them.
- God gives man and woman free will, that they may know love and trust.
- God gives man and woman dominion over the earth, and places them in Eden with the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.

## Day 7

- God sees his perfect creation and rests. God's glory is on full display. It is a holy day.

## Satan

One member of the host of heaven, called <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="satan" text="Satan" />, has it in his heart to rebel against God. It is possible he is one of the seraphim because he's represented as a serpent in the garden of Eden. He wants power for himself. He doesn't want to follow God's order, he wants to dethrone God. It is impossible, however, for something in the creation to overthrow the Creator, so in the ultimate power grab in the history of time, Satan tries to deceive the humans into worshiping him instead of God.

## The Fall

Satan knows that God has given humans free will, so he exploits it by telling the humans that they don't need God and that they can run things on their own. The humans give in and fall into sin. Sin creates death in God's good world, makes us impure, and mars our relationships with each other and with God.

Death and impurity can't withstand God's presence, so he casts down Satan from heaven, sentences him to destruction at a later time, and mercifully removes the humans from his presence.

It is not good for humans to remain away from God's presence for eternity, so he numbers their days. Thus, there is a chasm between God and humanity.

Now that death is introduced, Satan moves onto the next phase of his plan: bring humanity down with him. If he can get the humans to worship him instead, the humans will die in their sin with no hope of salvation, and he wins.

Man's intentions become only evil continually.

## Noah and the Flood

God remembers faithful Noah, and promises that if he builds an ark, he will be saved. Noah has faith and listens to God. God allows the waters to collapse back in on themselves. Faithful Noah is saved, and God separates the waters once more. God makes a covenant with Noah that he will not let the waters collapse back in on his world again. The sign of the covenant is the rainbow. He commands him to fill the earth.

## Babylon

The humans continue to listen to Satan, and begin to exalt themselves. They disregard God's command to fill the earth and create the nation of Babylon. They have one language, and make a unified effort to build a tower up to the heavens and dethrone God. To thwart their efforts, God scatters the humans and confuses their language.

## Abraham and Isaac

God remembers his promise to Noah, and makes a covenant with Noah's descendant Abram, an old man with no children, that he will exalt him, bring him out of Babylon and into a land that God prepared for him, and give him an offspring through whom all the families of the earth will be blessed. Abraham trusts God, and he is counted as righteous because of his faith.

Despite this promise, Abram begins trying to take matters into his own hands by doing things his own way, which leads to more calamity and broken relationships. God renames Abram to Abraham, makes the sign of the covenant circumcision, and promises him a son named Isaac.

God needs Abraham to have faith in his plan, and to submit to his will.

Abraham is old, so the only way to get through to him is through his beloved son Isaac, who bears God's promise for all the families of the world.

God tells Abraham to sacrifice his only son Isaac to pay for his wrongdoing. This would make sense in Abraham's cultural and historical context, as the firstborn son represented the family, and could bear the sins on behalf of their family.

Abraham is on an emotional rollercoaster since he remembers that God promised salvation through his son Isaac, but he surrenders his will to God and decides to trust God and his plan. Abraham has faith and listens to God, trusting that somehow God's plan will lead to good.

He gets right up to the point where he is about to sacrifice his son, and God sees that Abraham is faithful and is going to submit to his will, so he stops Abraham from sacrificing Isaac, and doubles down on the covenant. Abraham learns first hand that sin has serious consequences, and that we owe it to God to live completely for him.

Isaac has a son named Jacob who is renamed Israel. He becomes the bearer of the promise for salvation.

## Moses and the Exodus

The Israelites begin doing things their own way, and it leaves them exiled in Egypt.

Egypt forces them into slavery, so now God has to act to fulfill his promise to Israel. He calls the Israelites his firstborn son.

God chooses an Israelite named Moses to lead his people out of Egypt.

Moses submits himself completely in the service of God and begins to ask the Pharaoh to let his people go.

Satan rears his ugly head again and Pharaoh doesn't listen. Things get so bad that God comes to take what is rightfully his, every family in Egypt by means of every firstborn son.

God remembers his promise to Israel. To test their faith and give them a sign, he promises them that if they kill a lamb and put its blood on their doorposts, they will be saved. The Israelites have faith and listen to God.

The destroyer comes and kills every firstborn son in Egypt and spares the faithful Israelites.

Moses leads the people to the Red Sea, God separates the waters for the people to pass through, and lets the waters fall back in on themselves to destroy the Egyptian army chasing after them.

## The Law and The Tabernacle

Moses leads the people through the wilderness to Mt. Sinai, and God sustains them on their journey.

Moses tells the people to consecrate themselves for the Lord will appear to them.

God appears and gives all Israel his Law, and promises that if they obey him, they will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.

God tells them to build the tabernacle, the place where he will dwell in their midst.

God teaches them under what conditions they are to enter his presence, and teaches them about his holiness, how to offer their entire selves in the service of God, how to confess and pay for their sins, and how to maintain right relationships with each other and with him. This will allow God's presence to be with them as they make their way to the promised land.

Moses, who was called to the highest level of faith, and who has borne the sins of his people, is able to speak to God face to face, and becomes God's representative to the people, and the peoples' representative to God.

God asks Moses to display a wondrous act before all the people by providing water from a rock by speaking to it. Moses gets frustrated by the peoples' grumbling and strikes the rock and curses the people. God gives the people water, but Moses's actions do not uphold God as holy in the eyes of the people, so God prevents him from entering the promised land.

## Joshua and the Promised Land

God has Moses transfer his authority to Joshua, who has been faithful. Joshua is charged with leading the people into the promised land.

Joshua leads the people to the Jordan River and tells the people to consecrate themselves for the Lord will do wonders among them.

God makes the water pile up in one heap for Joshua and the people to pass through, and then lets it flow back after they cross. Israel is called a nation for the first time.

Joshua leads the people into the promised land and they renew their covenant with God, but after Joshua dies, the Israelites become complacent and don't do as God commands.

## King David

Israel starts a downward spiral into deep spiritual debt.

They continue to declare independence from God by desiring a human king like the other nations have.

God tells the prophet Samuel to give them what they want.

Their first king Saul leads them deeper into spiritual debt, so God exalts a lowly and righteous shepherd named David who has incredible faith, makes him king, and promises him an eternal throne as the "son of God".

David sins egregiously, so God takes the life of his firstborn son, but he made a promise to David, so the throne goes to his other son Solomon who builds a temple for the Lord.

A downward spiral of horrible kings begins, and the debt continues to pile up.

## The Exile to Babylon

God sends the prophets to warn the people of his judgment, but the people don't heed their warnings. The temple is destroyed and the Israelites are exiled to Babylon, the place where Abraham's story started, the center of human pride.

God promises they will return from exile after 70 years. Babylon falls to Persia, and the Israelites return to build a second temple.

The second temple is built, but they return to their old ways and the temple is profaned.

After Persia comes Greece, and then the Romans who oppress them.

## Despair

The Israelites are unable to keep the Law, which exposes the brokenness of the human heart. Satan uses this brokenness to continue to exploit them, lead them away from repentance and faith, and ultimately keep them away from God. Further, for some Israelites, the Law becomes a way to oppress others and exploit them for not being "righteous". Satan has tempted them into unknowingly using the Law in an oppressive way that God didn't intend. The Israelites are left in a debt of sin away from God's presence with no apparent hope. Satan is seemingly getting what he wants.

How is God going to enact justice while keeping his promise he made to David?

## Water, Spirit, and Resurrection

Israel profaned God's holy name, so for the sake of his name, God says he will act.

God says he will send a prophet like Elijah to lead the people in repentance, and prepare the way of his arrival.

God says that a king from the line of David will come and bear the sins of the people, save them from oppression, and lead them to an everlasting kingdom.

God says he will remove their heart of stone and give them a new heart and a new spirit. He will sprinkle them with clean water to cleanse them, and will put his Spirit within them.

God says in the time of the end, he will raise some to the resurrection of life, and others to the resurrection of judgment.

## John the Baptist

God sends John the Baptist, a prophet like Elijah who was filled with the Holy Spirit from birth, to lead the people in repentance in anticipation of the coming of the Lord. He baptizes them in the Jordan as a sign of repentance.

## The Lord Jesus Christ

In an act of amazing grace beyond comprehension, God becomes man and dwells in our midst. He forgives, teaches, heals, casts out spiritual evil, gathers disciples, and leads us in faith and repentance. He then fulfills the role of the Messiah on earth, and then in the greatest display of mercy in all of history, he bears our sins on the cross, suffering and dying for us all. Then he rises again, proving he is the Truth and giving us hope in resurrection life. He promises to send the Holy Spirit in his name to be in his disciples forever, and commissions them to proclaim the good news of God's kingdom to all nations.

When Jesus forgave us, died for us, and rose again, he thwarted Satan's plan of trapping us in death. Not only do we have hope in resurrection life, he proved that we are justified by faith, not by our works. Now when Satan tells us God doesn't love us, we know that's not true because he loves us so much that he died for us. Now when Satan tells us God doesn't care about our sin, we remember he died because of our sins. Now when Satan tells us man's heart is weak, we remember how Jesus, a man, overcame everything Satan could possibly throw at him and turned it into the greatest good imaginable. Now when Satan tells us to fear death, we remember how Jesus rose again and gave us the Holy Spirit to carry us through this life, remembering always that he is on the throne. Now Satan, destined for destruction, has to go into the fire without us, because the righteous live by their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He takes what the enemy meant for evil and he turns it for good.
