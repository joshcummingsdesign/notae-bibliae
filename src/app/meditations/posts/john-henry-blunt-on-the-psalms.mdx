The Psalms possess an inexhaustible depth which can be viewed from countless angles. They contain the history of Israel, the trials of David, the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, the prayers of the temple, and the prophecies of the Messiah. Yet there is one mode of viewing the Psalms that, within Divine Service, soars high above the rest: the spiritual mode which typifies Christ and his Church.

The 19th-century Anglican divine, Rev. Dr. John Henry Blunt, elaborates on this mode of viewing the Psalms in his notes on the Psalter.

> "[The Psalter] is above all, a book in which Christ and his Church are prefigured, so that David speaks in the person of his Lord, and Israel personifies that new Jerusalem which is the Mother of us all...All other views and meaning ought to be subordinated to this, which sees chiefly God, and Christ and the Church in the Psalms. Thus the Christian finds the Psalter a living word for every generation and if he sings concerning the City of God, the voice of his understanding and love dwells little on the historical Jerusalem of the past, but soars upward either to the allegory under figurative representation of the soul in which Christ dwells, or to the exalted Image which reveals to his faith that Celestial City, wherein will be the eternal home of the saints."

Blunt then discusses how Christ and the apostles themselves set this example for us.

> "In the earliest dawn of the Church after the Ascension, the apostles began to find in the Psalms an explanation of the events which were occurring around them. They recognized in the fall of an apostle a fulfillment of that 'which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas...' (Acts 1:16). And in the Resurrection of their Lord they found the one full interpretation of what the 'patriarch David...being a prophet...spake of the Resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption' (Acts 2:29-31). Such a use of the Psalms was not by way of adaptation or mere illustration, but as clear, unimpeachable evidence; infallible truth, coming from the Fountain of Truth.

> Nor is it to be wondered at that the apostles should thus immediately, and as a matter of course, go to the Psalms for light about Christ and the Church; for their Divine Master had often shown them the way during the time of his ministrations among them; while the last hours which he and they had spent together seem to have been wonderfully connected by him with 'the things that were spoken in the Psalms concerning him' (cf. Luke 24:44). It seems, indeed, as if our Blessed Lord took every opportunity at that time of showing how the meaning of the Psalter was to be seen clearly only when viewed in the light of gospel."

Blunt beautifully articulates how the Word, which inspired the Psalmists, became flesh, consecrating the Psalms twice—first by inspiring them, then by reciting them in his Incarnation—and how we, in turn, offer them back to God in reverent praise.

> "If we ask for words of prayer, in the Psalter we find the very Prayer Book which was used by Christ and his saints; and may use the privilege of sending up to the throne of grace the very aspirations that have been consecrated a second time by passing thither from the lips of the Son of Man. From one end to the other it is full of the praises of the Lord, such as the soul need never tire of uttering, and the Lord will never tire of receiving."

Blunt then summarizes his main point by describing the feeling we should have when we utter the Psalms in Divine Service.

> "There can be no doubt, therefore, that in thus using the Psalter as a treasury of truths respecting Christ and his Church, which God the Holy Ghost himself has filled from the treasury of divine wisdom, we are strictly following the course which our Lord and his apostles first pointed out. And when, offering up to God of that which he has given us, we take these truths out of this treasury, and cause them to ascend to the throne of his grace as the chief meaning of our words of praise, we make such a use of them as is most accordant with the habits of the saints, and with the teaching of our infallible Guide...Such a use of the Psalter will give to those who sing it day by day, some experience of the devout and happy feelings which David himself had, when he sang 'My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips' (Ps. 63:5)."
