## Pentecost

On the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem, all the apostles were in one place as they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak "as the Spirit gave them utterance" (Acts 2:1-4). As they were speaking, Jews from every nation who were there worshipping at the temple heard the sound and miraculously understood, each one in his own language, the apostles telling of the mighty works of God (Acts 2:5-6) (Acts 2:11). Peter speaks up and tells them that this miracle is a fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel (Acts 2:14) (Acts 2:16-17) (Joel 2:28), and then gives a sermon that leads to the baptism of around 3,000 people (Acts 2:41). Later, when Peter shares the gospel with a group of Gentiles at the house of Cornelius, the Holy Spirit falls on them, and they begin to speak in the same manner the apostles had (Acts 10:44-47).

Some believe that the apostles spoke in one language, and yet all miraculously understood. St. Thomas Aquinas refuted this theory.

> "It should be noted that because there were few in the early church assigned to preaching faith in Christ throughout the world, the Lord enabled them to proclaim the word to more people by giving them the gift of tongues, by which they could all preach to all. Not that they spoke in one language and were understood by all, as some say, but that they spoke the languages of different nations and, indeed, of all."

John Calvin's concern with the one-language theory was that it would have required a miracle also on behalf of the hearers and not only the apostles.

> "We must first note that the disciples spoke indeed with strange tongues; otherwise the miracle had not been wrought in them, but in the hearers…I suppose that it doth manifestly appear hereby that the apostles had the variety and understanding of tongues given them, that they might speak unto the Greeks in Greek, unto the Italians in the Italian tongue, and that they might have true communication (and conference) with their hearers."

Calvin did, however, leave open the possibility that there was also a miracle on behalf of the hearers, but did so cautiously.

> "Notwithstanding, I leave it indifference whether there was any second miracle wrought or no, so that the Egyptians and Elamites did understand Peter speaking in the Chaldean tongue, as if he did utter divers voices. For there be some conjectures which persuade me thus to think, and yet not so firm but that they may be refuted."

## **The Corinthians**

After the Book of Acts, the miraculous gifts of the Spirit continue on, and Paul addresses the Corinthians on the topic, saying, "Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good" (1 Cor. 12:4-7).

He continues, saying, "For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom…to another prophecy, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues" (1 Cor. 12:8-10). Paul does, however, follow this up with explaining the primacy of love, saying, "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal" (1 Cor. 13:1).

Paul then makes a distinction between what took place in Jerusalem on Pentecost and what was taking place in Corinth, saying, "For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit" (1 Cor. 14:2). This is different from Jews of every nation hearing and understanding the miraculous speaking of the apostles.

Thomas Aquinas puts it like this:

> "When the Apostle mentions here about speaking in a tongue, he means an unknown language not interpreted; as when one might speak German to a Frenchman without an interpreter, he is speaking in a tongue. Hence, all speech not understood not explained, no matter what it is, is properly called speaking in a tongue."

> <cite>[Aquinas on 1 Corinthians, par. 814](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~1Cor.C14.L1.n814)</cite>

John Calvin puts it like this:

> "The term [tongue] denotes a foreign language. The reason why he does not speak to men is—because no one heareth, that is, as an articulate voice. For all hear a sound, but they do not understand what is said."
>
> <cite>[Calvin on 1 Corinthians 14:2](https://ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom39/calcom39.xxi.i.html#xxi.i-p21)</cite>

Paul then tells the Corinthians, "The one who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but the one who prophesies builds up the church" (1 Cor. 14:4). Paul makes the point that speaking in another language to someone who doesn't understand that language doesn't do them any good. If one prophesies, however, God's word can be heard by all. Thus, he says, "I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue" (1 Cor. 14:18).

Though it is not outside of God's power to perform miracles, empower us with gifts, and raise up leaders as the need of the times demands, we should learn from the Corinthians, and use the gifts that God gives us for the edification of others.
