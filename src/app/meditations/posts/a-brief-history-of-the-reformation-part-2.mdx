## The Normans

The Normans were a Germanic group originating from Norse Vikings who intermingled with the Franks in modern northern France. In the early 11th century, Lombards in Byzantine-controlled southern Italy rebelled, recruiting Norman mercenaries. The Normans were granted land in return for their service, and quickly became the dominant power in southern Italy.[^1] The Norman use of Latin rite worship with unleavened bread created conflict with local Byzantine citizens who used leavened bread.[^2] Pope Leo IX came to view the Normans as violent and subversive, and raised an army to assist the Byzantine war against the Normans.[^3]

## The Great Schism

In the 11th-century, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Michael Cerularius unsuccessfully attempted to bring Alexandria and Antioch under his jurisdiction, which irritated the pope of Rome. Additionally, as Byzantine citizens came into conflict with the Normans in southern Itlay, Cerularius and his followers began to criticize the Latin rite, especially with regards to the *Filioque* and the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist, the latter which they viewed as a form of Judaizing. Soon after, Cerularius began to close down the Latin rite churches in Constantinople.[^4][^5]

Around the same time, Niketas Stethatos, an Eastern monk from Constantinople, wrote three treatises against the practices of the Western Church: *On Unleavened Bread* (condemning the Western rite of using unleavened bread in the Eucharist), *On the Sabbath* (condemning the Latin rite of Sabbath fasting), and *On the Marriage of the Priests* (condemning priestly celibacy).[^6] Eastern Archbishop Leo of Ohrid (in modern North Macedonia) wrote two letters to Roman Bishop John of Trani (modern Apulia, Italy) condemning the West for fasting on the Sabbath and using unleavened bread in the Eucharist.[^7] The letters were translated from Greek to Latin and sent to Pope Leo IX.[^8]

On the Feast of the Nativity of John the Baptist in 1053, Pope Leo IX sent ambassadors led by Cardinal Bishop Humbert of Silva Candida (modern La Storta, Rome) to Constantiople in attempts to meet with Cerularius. Niketas recanted, but Cerularius refused to meet with the legates.[^9]

On April 19, 1054, Pope Leo IX died, which left Humbert responsible for resolving the matter.[^10] Relations continued to break down, and on July 16, 1054, Humbert and his colleagues laid on the altar of Hagia Sophia, which was prepared for the celebration of the Divine Liturgy, a bull of excommunication. Rome's charges included claiming that baptism outside of the Eastern Church was invalid, condemning priestly celibacy, calling the Law of Moses "accursed", denying the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, condemning the tonsuring of monks, and denying Communion to those who used unleavened bread.[^11] Rome then issued an anathema against anyone who condemned the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist.[^12] In response, Cerularius convened a <Definition lang="greek" anchor="sunodos" text="synod" /> and excommunicated the Roman legates.[^13]

The Western Church ultimately became known as the Roman <Definition lang="greek" anchor="katholikos" text="Catholic" /> Church, and the Eastern Church ultimately became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church.

## The Norman Conquest of England

In 1066, the Normans invaded England in a conquest led by William, duke of Normandy, who claimed he had the right to the English throne, and defeated the Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings.[^14] French would then become the language of the aristocracy, but over time the Norman rulers and the English populace began to intermingle, and Old English eventually evolved into what we now call Middle English.[^15]

## The First Crusade

In 1095, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I requested help from the West to fend off the invasion of the Muslim Seljuk Turks. Pope Urban II agreed to help Alxios, perhaps hoping to improve East-West relations. Urban called the Council of Clermont (central France), in which he delivered an impassioned sermon, calling for an army to help their Christian brothers in the East, and offering indulgences to those who were willing to join. Lay preachers began to rally support, and in 1096, the crusaders headed off to Constantinople. In 1097 they took Nicaea, and a year later they took Antioch. Although they had fulfilled their mission to assist Constantinople, the crusaders didn't stop there. In 1099, they marched all the way into Jerusalem and took it. Many of the city's inhabitants were brutally massacred.[^16]

## Peter Waldo

Peter Waldo was a successful merchant from Lyon (southeastern France) in the 12th century. Being deeply troubled over the spiritual state of his soul and desperate to know how he could be saved, he became determined to read the Bible, but since it only existed in the Latin Vulgate, and his Latin was poor, he hired two scholars to translate it into the modern vernacular so he could study it. This has caused Waldo to be credited with providing to Europe the first translation of the Bible in a modern tongue outside of Latin.

Waldo was deeply moved by Jesus' words in the gospel of Luke, "One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me" (Luke 18:22). Jesus' words pierced Waldo's heart, and he suddenly realized he had been serving material wealth, not God. But unlike the rich young ruler who walked away from Jesus, Waldo repented and did exactly what Jesus said: he gave away all he had to the poor. From that point on, he was determined to rely completely on God for his provision.

Waldo immediately began to preach from his Bible in the streets of Lyon, especially to the poor. Many were converted, and by 1175, a sizable group of men and women began to follow him. They too gave away their possessions and were preaching. People started calling them the "Poor of Lyon." Later, as the group grew into a movement and spread throughout France and other parts of Europe, they became known as "the Waldensians."

The Waldensian movement was characterized from the beginning by lay preaching, voluntary poverty, and strict adherence to the Bible. They rejected such Roman Catholic teachings as purgatory, papal supremacy, and praying to the saints. In 1184, Waldo and his followers were excommunicated and went on to be heavily persecuted. Peter Waldo died in around 1205.[^17]

## The Fourth Crusade

The Fourth Crusade was a 13th-century armed expedition called by Pope Innocent III. The stated intent of the expedition was to recapture the Muslim-controlled city of Jerusalem, however, a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army's sack of Constantinople. This dealt a devastating blow to Christian unity, creating lasting animosity between the Eastern and Western churches.[^18]

## The Albigensian Crusade

The Albigensian Crusade was an early 13th-century military campaign initiated by Pope Innocent III to eliminate Catharism (a Gnostic movement) in Languedoc (southern France). "Albigensian" refers to the French city Albi (southern France) where the movement first took hold. The Albigensian Crusade lasted for 20 years, and thousands of people were brutally massacred.[^19]

## The Fourth Lateran Council

In 1215, Pope Innocent III convoked the the Fourth Lateran Council at the Lateran Palace in Rome. The council decreed that all heretics be excommunicated and handed over to secular authorities for punishment, and that secular leaders must swear to eradicate heresy from their territories or face excommunication and potential loss of their lands. It also decreed that Jews and Muslims were to wear distinct clothing to avoid being mistaken for Christians. This was a culmination of hostility towards Jews and Muslims during Innocent's reign as pope, generated in part by the Crusades.

The council formally acknowledged belonging to the Roman Catholic Church as necessary for salvation, saying, "There is indeed one Universal Church of the faithful, outside of which nobody at all is saved, in which Jesus Christ is both priest and sacrifice."

The council affirmed the doctrine of Real Presence, using the word <Definition lang="latin" anchor="transubstantiatio" text='"transubstantiation"' />, yet no philosophical details were given to explain the mystery. It also stated that only an ordained priest can administer the Eucharist, saying, "\[Christ's] body and blood are truly contained in the Sacrament of the Altar under the forms of bread and wine—the bread and wine being \[transubstantiated] by God's power into his body and blood—that this mystery of unity is realized: we receive from God what he received from us. Nobody can effect this Sacrament except a priest who has been properly ordained according to the church's keys (Matt. 16:18-19), which Jesus Christ himself gave to the apostles and their successors."[^20]

## The Inquisition

In the 13th century, the Inquisition began to take shape and become more formalized in the Roman Catholic Church as a way to uproot heretical movements, particularly after the Albigensian Crusade.[^21] In 1231, Pope Gregory IX worked with civil authorities to establish regulations requiring the capture and punishment of heretics within eight days of condemnation.[^22] Many sentences resulted in penance, but convictions of unrepentant heresy were handed over to the secular courts, which generally resulted in execution or life imprisonment.[^23]

## The Summa Theologiae

In the mid 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas, Doctor of the Roman Catholic Church, began his most famous work, the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="summa-theologiae" text="Summa Theologiae" />*, which started as a teaching tool for young Dominican friars, but became one of the most influential theological compendiums of all time. In it, he famously provided five arguments for the existence of God,[^24] as well as an Aristotelean explanation for the doctrine of transubstantiation, which states that at the words of consecration, the substance of the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ, while their accidents (taste, smell, color, texture, etc.) remain.[^25] On the feast of St. Nicholas in 1273, St. Thomas was celebrating Mass when he received a revelation that so affected him that he wrote and dictated no more, leaving his great work the *Summa* unfinished.[^26]

## The Unam Sanctam

The *Unam sanctam* (Latin: "One Holy") is a papal bull that was issued by Pope Boniface VIII on November 18, 1302. It laid down dogmatic propositions on the unity of the Roman Catholic Church, the necessity of belonging to it for eternal salvation, the position of the pope as supreme head of the Church and the duty thence arising of submission to the pope in order to belong to the Church and thus to attain salvation. The pope further emphasized the higher position of the spiritual in comparison with the secular order. The bull was the definitive statement of the late medieval theory of hierocracy, which argued for the temporal as well as spiritual supremacy of the pope. The bull stated, "We are informed by the texts of the gospels that in this Church and in its power are two swords; namely, the spiritual and the temporal." The metaphor refers to the swords yielded by the apostles upon Jesus' arrest (Luke 22:38). Thus, the Roman Catholic Church interpreted Scripture to claim the power of the temporal sword. The bull ends with, "We declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman pontiff."[^27]

## John Wycliffe

John Wycliffe was a 14th-century English Catholic priest and theologian. Wycliffe advocated for biblical literacy and public preaching, and in around 1380, he led the translation of the Vulgate into Middle English.[^28] He also rejected overreaching papal authority, transubstantiation, and the necessity of the sacrament of Confession.[^29] His followers were called by their persecutors "the Lollards", which comes from a Middle Dutch word that means "to mumble".[^30] Wycliffe died of a stroke in 1348. After his death, the Roman Catholic Church deemed him to be heretical, and ordered all his writings to be burned.[^31]

## De Heretico Comburendo

In 1401, the English Parliament under King Henry IV enacted a law called *De heretico comburendo* (Latin: "On the burning of the heretic") which made it illegal to propagate ideas deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, and ordered severe punishment, including burning, for those who were tried and refused to recant.[^32]

## Jan Hus

Jan Hus was a 15th-century Catholic priest and theologian from Prague (modern Czech Republic). Hus resisted overreaching papal claims and the sale of indulgences. In 1409, he was brought into discipline for defending Wycliffe when his writings were ordered to be burned, and was barred from preaching. Hus continued to preach and was excommunicated a year later.[^33] His followers became known as "the Hussites". [^34]

## The Council of Constance

In 1414, Sigismund, King of Hungary, convened the Council of Constance (modern southern Germany) to end papal schism in the Catholic Church. Aside from electing a new pope to resolve the schism, the council decreed that the laity were only to be offered the bread and not the wine in the Eucharist. The council also condemned John Wycliffe and Jan Hus as heretics, and Hus was imprisoned. Jerome of Prague, a supporter of Hus, came to Constance to offer assistance but was similarly arrested and found guilty of heresy.[^35]

## The Execution of Jan Hus

During Jan Hus' trial, Jacob Balardi Arrigoni, Bishop of Lodi (northern Italy), delivered a sermon in which he took a verse out of context from Romans to state that "that the body of sin be destroyed" (Rom. 6:6). Hus was then given the chance to recant or die, to which he responded, "God is my witness that the principal intention of my preaching and of all my other acts or writings was solely that I might turn men from sin. And in that truth of the gospel that I wrote, taught, and preached in accordance with the sayings and expositions of the Holy Doctors, I am willing gladly to die today." He was then humiliated and tied to the stake. He then said, "You are now going to burn a goose, but in a century you will have a swan which you can neither roast nor boil." The name "Hus" in the Bohemian language means "goose".[^36] He was then burned at the stake. As the flames went up he could be heard singing, "Jesus, son of the living God, have mercy on me."[^37]

## The Persecution of the Lollards and the Hussites

In 1420, Pope Martin V issued a bull that called for a crusade against the Lollards and the Hussites,[^38] and in 1428, he decreed that John Wycliffe's body be exhumed and burned.[^39]

## The Continued Persecution of the Waldensians

In 1487, Pope Innocent VIII issued a bull that called for a crusade against the Waldensians.[^40]

## St. Peter's Basilica

By the end of the 15th century, the Old St. Peter's Basilica had fallen into disrepair, and Pope Nicholas V planned to repair it. By the time of his death, more than 2,500 cartloads of stone had been transported from the Colosseum for use in the new building.[^41] Pope Julius II planned far more for St. Peter's than Nicholas V's program of repair. Julius was at that time planning his own tomb, which was to be designed and adorned with sculptures by Michelangelo and placed within St Peter's. In 1505, Julius made a decision to demolish the ancient basilica and replace it with a monumental structure to house his tomb and aggrandize himself in the popular imagination. A succession of popes and architects followed in the next 120 years, and their combined efforts resulted in the present building.[^42][^43]

One method employed to finance the building of St. Peter's Basilica was the granting of indulgences in return for contributions. Pope Leo X placed Cardinal Bishop Albert of Brandenburg (northeastern Germany) in charge of promoting the program in his region. Albert appointed Dominican preacher Johann Tetzel of Saxony to aid in his outreach efforts, but the preaching of indulgences and handling of the funds provoked a scandal.[^44]
