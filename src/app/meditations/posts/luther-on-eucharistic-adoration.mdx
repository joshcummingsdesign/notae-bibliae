While Martin Luther had some harsh words to say about the Roman Catholic Church's processions during the Feast of Corpus Christi, it should be noted that Luther's primary concern was not Eucharistic adoration in and of itself. For Luther, the processions highlighted the growing disparity between priests and laity, as the laity were being deprived of Communion in both kinds. Moreover, Luther believed that the Church had lost sight of what he saw as central to the Lord's Supper and the gospel: Christ's Word of promise for the forgiveness of sins.

In a 1535 sermon on Luke:14:15-17, Luther had this to say:

> "The Papists, contrary to the order of the ancient Church, have appointed
this Gospel lesson for the first Sunday after Trinity, because they
celebrated it the week during the festival of Corpus Christi, as is still the
custom among them. For they interpreted the supper, of which this Gospel
speaks, to signify the Sacrament of the Altar, and thereby desired to
establish the Communion in one part or form only, which, as you well
know, is one of their chief abuses..."

In Luther's view, this withholding of Communion in both kinds created a disparity between the priests and the laity, which, he argues, was not Christ's intent for instituting the Lord's Supper. This was only made more apparent to Luther in the Corpus Christi processions of his time.

> "Inasmuch as young people are growing up and know nothing about such festivals or pompous demonstrations—and as we older persons forget it also—it is well to remind our people so that when our youth come to their churches and see such things, they may not be offended, but may be able to say that it is not right to play with the Holy Sacrament and carry it about in order to dispense so many false indulgences; not with the intention of honoring the Sacrament—for then they would have carried the entire Sacrament, or both elements, bread and wine—but rather to the shame and disgrace of the Sacrament. They do this so that they themselves may be honored—namely, to maintain the distinction that the order of priests is a higher and more special order before God than the common order of Christians, because the priests alone receive the entire Sacrament...and other Christians, as people of a lower order, must be satisfied with only one part of the Sacrament.
>
> This difference they sought to introduce among the people by such a
festival in order thus to praise their order above others, to the shame and
disgrace of the Holy Sacrament and our Lord Jesus Christ, who did not
institute his Holy Sacrament for a special order over and above the common
order of Christians; just as he also did not suffer and die for a special order,
but for the comfort of his Christian Church which is not divided, but
consists of one body, of the one only Head, Jesus Christ, where all the
members, so far as life and character are concerned, are equal; although
their works are unequal and different."

It is this central truth that Luther felt was lost in the pomp of the Corpus Christi processions of his day: Christ's one body given for the forgiveness of sins, uniting all believers into his one body, the Church—regardless of status or vocation.

In terms of Eucharistic adoration, however, Luther didn't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Instead, he argued that the primary purpose of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist isn't solely for our worship, it's for our spiritual nourishment and comfort; and that though worship is fitting, it should not be mandated, but rather freely offered by the believer.

> "[Christ] is present in the Sacrament and in the hearts of believers not really because he wants to be worshiped there, but because he wants there to work with us and help us; just as he also came to earth in the flesh not that men should worship him, but to serve us, as he himself said, 'I have not come to be served but to serve and to give my life for many' (Matt. 20:28).
>
> But from this it does not follow that one should not worship him. For many people worshiped him when he was upon earth and he accepted it too, such as the three kings at the manger (Matt. 2:11), the blind man (John 9:38), and many others. Nevertheless, his state at that time was not yet the state of his honor and glory, for which nothing but worship and adoration is fitting. There had to be freedom to worship or not to worship, because no definite command had been given to worship him before he was glorified. That is why he allowed himself to be worshiped at times, and at other times not to be worshiped. Likewise, here in the Sacrament and in all believing hearts it should be left a matter of freedom, in order that we may be assured that he gave no command about worshiping him in the Sacrament or in believing hearts. Moreover, that is not the reason for his presence there. Nevertheless, one should not withhold from him such worship and adoration either; but freely give it, if the proper time and occasion presents itself, or omit it.
>
> For that reason we say now that one should not condemn people or accuse them of heresy if they do not adore the Sacrament, for there is no command to that effect and it is not for that purpose that Christ is present. Just as we read that the apostles did not adore the Sacrament since they were sitting and eating at table (Matt. 26:20) (Matt. 26:26). On the other hand, one should not condemn and accuse of heresy people who do adore the Sacrament. For although Christ has not commanded it, neither has he forbidden it, but often accepted it. Free, free it must be, according as one is disposed in his heart and has opportunity. Therefore both parties are to be blamed when they take a stand on either of these two sides and quarrel over this matter and condemn one another, and both of them miss the middle way."
