## The Early Church

The Greek word for <Definition lang="greek" anchor="kuriakos" text='"church"' /> in the New Testament is *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="ekklesia" text="ekklesia" />*, which means "assembly". It refers to all believers united by faith in Jesus Christ, who is God incarnate and the head of all things on earth and in heaven (Eph. 1:22). The <Definition lang="greek" anchor="apostolos" text="apostles" /> were disciples sent by Jesus to carry out the work of his ministry (Matt. 10:1-4). Jesus commissioned them, saying, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:19-20).

The early church was referred to as The Way (Acts 9:1-2). Fellowship, prayer, and service took place mainly in private homes (1 Cor. 16:19). The apostles began their mission in Jerusalem (Acts 1:4-5), and eventually established a church in Antioch, which is where the followers of Jesus were called <Definition lang="greek" anchor="khristianos" text='"Christians"' /> for the first time (Acts 11:25-26). It is from Antioch that St. Paul and St. Barnabas are sent on their first mission into Asia Minor (Acts 13:1-3).

Tradition holds that in the 1st century, St. Peter and St. Paul established a church in Rome,[^1] St. Andrew established a church in Byzantium (modern Istanbul, Turkey),[^2] and St. Mark, who derived his authority from St. Peter, established a church in Alexandria.[^3] The early church was conciliar. We see this in the the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 where the apostles, elders, and whole church determined it was good to not burden their Christian brothers with the Law of Moses (Acts 15:22).

In around 48 AD, St. Paul writes his Epistle to the Galatians,[^4] and soon after begins his second mission with St. Silas (Acts 15:40-41). It is during this time that St. Paul writes 1 and 2 Thessalonians from Corinth.[^5][^6] In around 52 AD, St. Paul heads off to Galatia and Phrygia on his third mission (Acts 18:23).[^7] It is during this time that he writes 1 Corinthians from Ephesus,[^8] 2 Corinthians from Macedonia,[^9] and Romans from Corinth.[^10]

## Neronian Persecution

In around 62 AD, St. Peter wrote 1 Peter from Rome.[^11] St. Paul was imprisoned in Rome, where he wrote Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.[^12] St. Paul was released from prison and carried on further mission work. It was during this time that he wrote 1 Timothy and Titus.[^13] Just a few years later, Roman Emperor Nero blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome, and started a brutal wave of persecutions.[^14] Both St. Peter and St. Paul were imprisoned in Rome and sentenced to death. It was during this time that St. Peter wrote 2 Peter,[^15] and St. Paul wrote 2 Timothy.[^16] In around 68 AD, St. Peter and St. Paul were martyred at the Circus of Nero in Rome.[^17] Tradition holds that St. Peter was crucified upside down, unwilling to be crucified in the same manner as Christ,[^18] and that St. Paul was beheaded.[^19]

## Early Church Leadership

The New Testament uses three terms for leaders in the church: <Definition lang="greek" anchor="episkopos" text="bishop" />, <Definition lang="greek" anchor="presbuteros" text="presbyter" />, and <Definition lang="greek" anchor="diakonos" text="deacon" />. According to St. Jerome, the terms "bishop" and "presbyter" were synonymous in the early church, but as a matter of good order, they were made two separate offices, the former over the latter; and deacons, such as St. Stephen (Acts 6:2-5), were those ordained to serve as ministers to care for the needy.[^20][^21] The presbyters eventually adopted the title "priest", the highest-ranking bishop of Rome eventually adopted the title <Definition lang="latin" anchor="papa" text='"pope"' />, and the highest-raking bishops of Jerusalem, Antioch, Byzantium, and Alexandria eventually adopted the title <Definition lang="greek" anchor="patriarkhes" text='"patriarch"' />.

## Pope St. Clement I

Pope St. Clement I was the third bishop of Rome. Tradition holds that he was ordained by St. Peter, and was a co-laborer of St. Paul (Phil. 4:3), thus he is considered to be the first Apostolic Father.[^22] He wrote The First Epistle of Clement, a letter to the church of Corinth in which he rebuked those who had rebelled against the church's presbyters.

## The Diocletian Persecutions

In the early 4th century, Roman Emperor Diocletian initiated a long wave of brutal persecutions which lasted over a decade. He attempted to force Christians to offer sacrifices to the Roman gods, but Christians remained faithful to the Lord and refused to do so. In 303 AD, Diocletian publicly declared all Christians would be persecuted. They were stripped of their freedom and subjected to violence and torture. Churches, Scripture, and even Christians themselves were burned.[^23]

## Constantine I

In 312 AD, following the Diocletian Persecutions, Roman Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Tradition holds that on the Via Flaminia in Rome, before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (a famous battle in the Roman civil war between Constantine and his rival Maxentius), Constantine saw a vision of a cross of light in the sky along with the words "*In hoc signo vinces*" (Latin: "In this sign, you will conquer"). Following this vision, he instructed his soldiers to adorn their shields with the Chi Rho symbol—a monogram formed by superimposing the Greek letters chi (Χ) and rho (Ρ), the first two letters of <Definition lang="greek" anchor="khristos" text='"Christ"' /> in Greek (ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ).[^24] In 313 AD, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire.[^25]

In around 320 AD, Constantine ordered the construction of the St. Peter's Basilica (now called the Old St. Peter's Basilica), which took about 40 years to complete. It was built over the historical site of the Circus of Nero, where St. Peter and St. Paul were martyred. Over the next twelve centuries, the Old St. Peter's Basilica gradually gained importance, and eventually became a major place of pilgrimage in Rome.[^26]

Constantine founded the city of New Rome in 324 AD on the site of the existing settlement of Byzantium. In 330 AD it was renamed Constantinople and became the capital of the Roman Empire.[^27]

## The First Council of Nicaea

Around the time of the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, Arius, a priest in Alexandria, began teaching that Jesus was a created being. In response to this, Emperor Constantine summoned the Council of Nicaea (modern northwestern Turkey) in 325 AD. This was the first <Definition lang="greek" anchor="oikoumenikos" text="ecumenical" /> council of the Christian church. The council drew up the Nicene Creed which became Christianity's defining statement of belief, later amended at the First Council of Constantinople.[^28] The council also decreed that a bishop should be appointed by all the bishops in the province, but that if this was not possible, at least three should meet together.[^29]

## The First Council of Constantinople

Though the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD had clarified many points of doctrine, many theological misunderstandings remained. Apollinaris, bishop of Laodicea in southwestern Asia Minor (Rev. 3:14), began teaching that Jesus was not fully man, but had a divine will and intellect; and Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, began teaching that Holy Spirit was not fully God, but was a ministering angel. In 381 AD, Roman Emperor Theodosius I and St. Gregory of Nazianzus called the First Council of Constantinople. This was the second ecumenical council of the Christian church. Along with condemning the teachings of Apollinaris and Macedonius, the council drew up the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed which amended the Nicene Creed to include that the Holy Spirit is consubstantial with the Father, and that one apostolic church and one baptism for the remission of sins are acknowledged. Today, this version is commonly referred to as simply the "Nicene Creed".[^30] A canon was also added which clarified that a bishop was to only have jurisdiction over his <Definition lang="latin" anchor="dioecesis" text="diocese" />.[^31]

## The Goths

In the late 4th century, the lands of the Goths, an East Germanic group, were invaded from the east by the Huns. Some of these Goths fled west and became a Roman-allied military group called the Visigoths, united under their king, Alaric. The Goths who stayed in the east would eventually become the Ostrogoths, united under their king, Theodoric the Great.[^32]

## The Anglo-Saxons

The Saxons were a Germanic group who lived in the northern coast of Germania (modern Germany). The Saxons who migrated over to Britannia (modern Britain) in the early 5th century became known as the Anglo-Saxons (Latin: *Angli Saxones*, "the English Saxons"), a name used to distinguish them from the mainland Saxons. Their language came to be known as Old English.[^33]

## The Fall of the Western Roman Empire

Starvation, high taxes, hatred from the Roman population, and governmental corruption turned the Visigoths against the Roman Empire,[^34] and in 410 AD, they sacked Rome. This marked the first time in almost 800 years that Rome had been besieged by a foreign enemy, and symbolized the weakening and vulnerability of the empire, leading to further erosion of central authority.[^35] During this time, Rome also lost control of Britannia, as no troops could be spared to fend off the incoming Anglo-Saxons.[^36] In 455 AD, yet another Germanic group, the Vandals, launched an even more severe attack on Rome, which marked the decline and impending fall of the Western Roman Empire.[^37]

## The Council of Ephesus

The Council of Ephesus, held in 431 AD, was the third ecumenical council of the Christian church, convened by Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II in the city of Ephesus (modern western Turkey). It was primarily called to address the Nestorian controversy, which arose from teachings by Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople, who asserted that the Virgin Mary should be called *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="khristotokos" text="Khristotokos" />* rather than *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="theotokos" text="Theotokos" />*, emphasizing the distinction between Christ's divine and human natures. The council affirmed the title *Theotokos* as orthodox, emphasizing the unity of Christ's divine and human natures. Nestorius' teachings were condemned as heretical, leading to his deposition and exile.[^38]

## The Council of Chalcedon

The Council of Chalcedon, held in 451 AD, was the fourth ecumenical council of the Christian church, convened by Eastern Roman Emperor Marcian in the city of Chalcedon (a district in modern Istanbul, Turkey). It addressed the theological disputes surrounding the nature of Christ, particularly in response to the teachings of Eutyches, presbyter at Constantinople, and the monophysite doctrine, which emphasized Christ's divine nature at the expense of his humanity. The council affirmed the doctrine of the hypostatic union, declaring that Christ exists in two natures, fully divine and fully human, united in one person without confusion, change, division, or separation. This definition is known as the Chalcedonian Creed. The council also added a canon which acknowledged Rome's primacy of honor, and elevated Constantinople to second after Rome. The Roman delegates and Pope St. Leo the Great rejected this canon.[^39] The council's decisions significantly shaped Christian orthodoxy, but also led to lasting schisms with those who rejected its conclusions, such as the Oriental Orthodox Church.[^40]

## The Baptism of Clovis I

In 486 AD, Clovis I, the first king of the Franks (a Germanic group from Western Europe), defeated the last Roman governor of Gaul (modern France) at the Battle of Soissons, establishing Frankish dominance over much of the region. Clovis was born a pagan, but later became interested in converting to Arian Christianity. His wife St. Clotide, however, eventually persuaded him to convert to Nicene Christianity, and he was baptized in 508 AD. Clovis' Nicene baptism was of immense importance in the subsequent history of Western and Central Europe in general, as Clovis expanded his dominion over almost all of Gaul.[^41]

## The Lombards

Odoacer, a Germanic military leader, led a revolt and deposed the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 AD.[^42] Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, overthrew Odoacer in 493 AD.[^43] Byzantine Emperor Justinian I defeated the Ostrogoths at the end of the Gothic War in 554 AD, but the war was a devastating blow to Italy, and the territory was left weakened.[^44] The Lombards, a Germanic group from the areas of modern northern Germany and Denmark, eventually conquered Rome in 568 AD.[^45]

## The Rise of Constantinople

By the 6th century, Constantinople had grown in importance both politically and ecclesiastically. Byzantine Emperor Justinian I had reinforced its role as the center of the Eastern Christian world, building the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="hagia-sophia" text="Hagia Sophia" /> and asserting imperial control over church matters.[^46] In the late 6th century, Patriarch John IV the Faster assumed the title "Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople", a title that came to be used thereafter to underscore Constantinople's primacy of honor among the churches in the East.[^47] In response, Pope St. Gregory the Great wrote a letter to Byzantine Emperor Maurice expressing that anyone calling himself by such an exalted title does so out of pride.[^48]

## The Gregorian Mission

In around 596 AD, Pope St. Gregory the Great chose St. Augustine of Canterbury, the first Archbishop of Canterbury (in Kent, southeast England), to lead a mission to Britain to convert the Anglo-Saxons.[^49] In 601 AD, St. Gregory sent another notable missionary, St. Paulinus of York, who became the first Archbishop of York (in North Yorkshire, northeast England).[^50]

## The Filioque

In the late 6th century, the Western Church began adding the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="filioque" text="Filioque" />* to the Nicene Creed in attempts to combat Arianism. *Filioque* is Latin for "and the Son", and it asserts that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son.[^51] The Eastern Church not only disagreed with the theology, but took offense that this was done outside of an ecumenical council.[^52]

## Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire

In the late 8th century, Charlemagne, king of the Franks, defeated the Lombards in Rome. At Mass on Christmas Day in 800 AD, he was was crowned emperor by Pope Leo III at the Old St. Peter's Basilica, marking the beginning of what would come to be known as the Holy Roman Empire. While this was a pivotal moment which signified the West's return to glory, the papacy's decision to crown its own emperor became a major point of contention between the papacy and the Byzantine world.

Charlemagne's territory would now extended from Gaul in the west, across to modern Germany in the east, and as far south as Rome.[^53] Charlemagne established his palace in Aachen (modern western Germany), which included his famous Palatine Chapel.[^54] His reign led to what came to be known as the Carolingian Renaissance, in which works of art, literature, and architecture flourished. Many manuscripts were preserved, and many cathedrals and monasteries were built.[^55]

Charlemagne had a profound impact on the Western Church, but his adoption of the *Filioque* and his role in the expansion of papal authority increased tensions with the Eastern Church.[^56]

## The Eucharistic Controversy

Although the Church Fathers predominantly held that Christ's body and blood are truly present in the Eucharist (a belief known as the Real Presence), the philosophical details were largely left open to mystery.[^57] While the East would continue to embrace this mystery,[^58] the rise of <Definition lang="greek" anchor="skholastikos" text="scholasticism" /> in the West created space for philosophical discussion on the matter.[^59]

In 831 AD, St. Paschasius Radbertus, abbot of Corbie (northern France), wrote a treatise on the Eucharist entitled *De Corpore et Sanguine Domini* (Latin: "On the Body and Blood of the Lord"), in which he asserted that at the words of consecration, the bread and wine become Christ's historical body and blood—"historical" meaning his same natural body that was born of the Virgin Mary and suffered the passion. To explain the mystery, Paschasius made a distinction between the bread's outward appearance (Latin: *figura*, "figure") and its underlying reality (Latin: *veritas*, "truth"), the latter of which he suggested could only be discerned by faith.[^60]

In 843 AD, Ratramnus, Frankish monk at Corbie, wrote a work by the same name in which he asserted that at the words of consecration, the bread and wine become Christ's glorified body and blood, which because of his divine nature are imperceptible.[^61]

Debate over the theology of the Eucharist would continue on through the 11th century. Berengar of Tours, archdeacon of Angers (western France), asserted that Christ's body remains locally present in heaven, but that in partaking of the bread and wine—which signify Christ's body and blood—one is united with him by the Holy Spirit. Berengar was condemned by multiple councils for his view, but he ultimately recanted.[^62][^63]
