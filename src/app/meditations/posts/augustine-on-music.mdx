In the 4th century, St. Augustine wrote *De Musica* (Latin: "On Music"), which included six books. Music professor Dr. John MacInnis offers a helpful synthesis of how Augustine saw music's relationship to the soul and God's order and beauty.

> Augustine's relationship to music as a liberal art was, in many ways, typical for his day. That is, in late Antiquity, *musica* was largely a mathematical art studied in the philosophical context of Neoplatonism. For example, in *De Ordine* (Latin: 'On Order'), completed in 386, Augustine presents the liberal arts as preparation for philosophical study and explains how numbers are a means by which the unity and coherence of creation can be discerned, with implications for living a well-ordered life. Additionally, it was thought, through the study of physical reality, e.g., via quantitative liberal arts, like music, a soul is trained to reach for the incorporeal. This aphorism is actually a cornerstone in Augustinian aesthetics: Get past the responses of your physical senses to perceive the higher reality; move beyond the created to the Creator.

> In order to rank their types, Augustine explains how rhythms act in relation to the human soul and physical body; he concludes that both soul and body have their own rhythms…Augustine then explains how the discernment of rhythmic equality and symmetry in music is only one way in which we may identify an order pervasive throughout all creation. For example, the motions of the cosmos demonstrate an appropriate ordering for the soul; the planets move in perfect unity in imitation of eternity, and their rhythms unite earthly things in 'the hymn of the universe'.

> Additionally, for Augustine, those rhythms we experience in our earthly life may be beautiful, but they should not be valued inordinately. Rather, pleasing, well-crafted rhythms point us toward an inherent love of order—which the soul needs—and serve as another call to embrace reason as opposed to base sensuality.

> Throughout *De Musica VI*, Augustine refers to the Ambrosian hymn, *Deus Creator Omnium* (Latin: 'God the Creator of All Things'), his mother's favorite, and this hymn serves as a model for what Augustine intends music to be. That is, there are rhythms at play all along the process of someone recalling and singing the chant, to the hearing of it, to the contemplation of it, and, for Augustine, the song is so well crafted that a soul easily moves from the beauty of the music, received by the senses, to contemplation of God's transcendent beauty."
