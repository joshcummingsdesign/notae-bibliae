## Introduction

In this article we are going to examine a key passage that relates to the establishment of the Church.

> **"Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, 'Who do people say that the Son of Man is?' And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.' He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?' Simon Peter replied, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.' And Jesus answered him, 'Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.' Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ."**

> <cite>Matthew 16:13-20</cite>

In order to understand this passage, we must first define the following terms:

1. The rock on which the Church is built
2. The keys to the kingdom of heaven
3. The binding and loosing on earth as it is in heaven

## The Rock

Peter's confession of Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, is a pivotal moment in Scripture. Soon after, Jesus will foretell his suffering and death, and later be transfigured.

After Peter's confession, Jesus says, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 16:17). Jesus makes a play on words here as "Bar-Jonah" means "son of Jonah" in Aramaic, and Jonah means "dove" in Hebrew. Thus, he is calling Peter "son of the dove." As we know, the dove is the sign of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:16), and right after Jesus tells Peter that it is the Father who revealed the truth of his identity to him, presumably by the Spirit.

> "And Christ's response seems to correspond to Peter's confession. For he had confessed him to be the Son of God, and Jesus calls him the son of the dove, namely of the Holy Spirit, for this confession could only have come about by the Holy Spirit."

Next Jesus tells Peter, "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:18). Here Jesus tells us why he called Simon "Peter", which means "rock" (John 1:42). It is because Peter—here representing the apostles—signifies Christ's intentions for his Church: that it be built upon the foundation of the apostles with Christ as the cornerstone (Eph 2:19-22).

> "The Church, therefore, which is founded in Christ received from him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in the person of Peter, that is to say, the power of binding and loosing sins. For what the Church is essentially in Christ, such representatively is Peter in the rock."
>
> <cite>[Augustine, Tractates on the Gospel of John, Tractate 124, sec. 5](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701124.htm)</cite>

It is important to note here that Peter isn't the rock in and of himself, he is the rock in that Christ is the rock, and that he is in Christ.

> "One should say that Christ is the foundation through himself, but Peter insofar as he holds the confession of Christ, insofar as he is his vicar…So Christ is the foundation through himself, but the apostles are the foundation not through themselves, but by Christ's permission, and by the authority given by Christ."
>
> <cite>[Aquinas on Matthew, par. 1384](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~Matt.C16.L2.n1384)</cite>

Thus, it is also safe to say here that Jesus is the Rock.

> "For the Rock was Christ (1 Cor. 10:4); and on this foundation was Peter himself also built. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus (1 Cor 3:11)."
>
> <cite>[Agustine, Tractates on the Gospel of John, Tractate 124, sec. 5](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701124.htm)</cite>

The rock in this passage also represents the confession of faith in Jesus Christ, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail.

> "What then says Christ? 'You are Simon, the son of Jonas; you shall be called Cephas.' 'Thus since you have proclaimed my Father, I too name him that begot you;' all but saying, 'As you are son of Jonas, even so am I of my Father.' Else it were superfluous to say, 'You are Son of Jonas;' but since he had said, 'Son of God,' to point out that he is so Son of God, as the other son of Jonas, of the same substance with him that begot him, therefore he added this, 'And I say unto you, You are Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church' (Matt. 16:18); that is, on the faith of his confession. Hereby he signifies that many were now on the point of believing, and raises his spirit, and makes him a shepherd. 'And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.' 'And if not against it, much more not against me. So be not troubled because you are shortly to hear that I shall be betrayed and crucified.'"

**Takeaway:** The "rock on which the church is built" in Matthew 16:18 refers to 1. Jesus through himself as the chief cornerstone of the Church, 2. Peter through Jesus as a representative of the apostles, and 3. the confession of faith in Jesus Christ, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail.

## The Keys

After Jesus declares he will establish his Church, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail, he says to Peter, "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matt. 16:19). The "keys" here represent freedom from sins by Christ's passion and the subsequent ministry of the Church, that is, the authority given to the apostles to teach the word of God and administer the Sacraments. This is what leads one into the kingdom of heaven.

> "But let us see what the keys are. When a house is locked, it obstructs entry; but a key removes the obstacle. The kingdom of heaven had an obstacle, but not on its own part; 'I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven' (Rev 4:1), but the obstacle was on our part, namely, sin, because 'there shall not enter into it anything defiled' (Rev 21:27). Christ removed this impediment by his passion, because 'he washed us from our sins in his blood' (Rev 1:5). And he communicated this so that sins might be removed through a ministry, which is completed by the strength of Christ's blood. Hence the Sacraments have strength from the strength of Christ's passion. Hence I will give to you a ministry."

> "'The keys to the kingdom of heaven.' Such a treasure has the Church; that is, the people or assembly, who confess with Peter that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God. But this treasure the Christian Church distributes not only in word, through absolution and especially the public preaching (as in Acts 2:41), but also through Baptism and the Supper of the Lord Christ."

When Christ speaks of binding and loosing, he is speaking of the forgiveness of sins, namely that those forgiven know they are truly forgiven in heaven.

> "The Church, therefore, which is founded in Christ received from him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in the person of Peter, that is to say, the power of binding and loosing sins. For what the Church is essentially in Christ, such representatively is Peter in the rock."
>
> <cite>[Augustine, Tractates on the Gospel of John, Tractate 124, sec. 5](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701124.htm)</cite>

> "But why does he say keys? Because to absolve is to remove an obstacle…But it seems that this is set down unfittingly, because a key is not used to bind, but to open. I say that this is a fitting use of a key. For heaven itself is open, 'I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven' (Rev 4:1). Hence it is not necessary that it be opened; rather, the bond of him who should enter must be loosed."

**Takeaway:** The "keys to the kingdom of heaven" in Matthew 16:19 refers to the freedom from sins by Christ's passion and the subsequent ministry of the Church, that is, the authority given to the apostles to teach the word of God and administer the Sacraments. The "binding and loosing on earth as it is in heaven" refers to the forgiveness of sins, namely that those forgiven know they are truly forgiven in heaven. This is what leads one into the kingdom of heaven.
