## The Trinity

We pray to the Trinity as "our Father" because being created in his image we are his children in the analogous sense ([ST I, q. 33, a. 3, co., par. 5](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q33.A3.C.5)).

## God the Father

We pray to God the Father, the first Person of the Trinity, as "our Father" because while only Jesus can call him "My Father" in the proper sense, he is our Father through Christ (John 1:12) (John 16:27) ([Aquinas on John, par. 2155](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~Ioan.C16.L7.n2155.3)) ([Aquinas on Matt., par. 584](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~Matt.C6.L3.n584.6)).

## God the Son

We pray to God the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, because he is consubstantial with the Father ([Aquinas on John, par. 2155](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~Ioan.C16.L7.n2155.2)).

## Jesus as Intercessor

We pray to Jesus because as High Priest he makes intercession for us (Rom. 8:34) (Heb. 4:15-16) (Heb. 7:25) (1 John 2:1).

## In Jesus' Name

Someone's name, in the biblical sense, represents all that they are. The phrase "in Jesus' name" means according to his will, for his glory, and in his power. Jesus is the way to the Father (John 14:6) (John 1:18). The Father sends us the Holy Spirit in Jesus' name to be with us forever (John 14:16), that we may take up our cross and follow him (Matt. 16:24). Nothing we do in the Holy Spirit is by our own merit or authority. It is by Jesus' merit and authority we do everything, including approach the throne of the Father. So let everything we do, including our prayers, be in Jesus' name (Ps 51:15).

## Through Jesus

Whatever the Father wills, Jesus does (John 5:19). Jesus speaks the word of the Father to us (John 12:49-50), which is made intelligible by the Holy Spirit who glorifies Jesus (John 14:26) (John 16:13-14). Jesus answers our prayers according to the will of and for the glory of the Father (John 14:13). All things are from the Father through Jesus (John 1:3), and all things are to the Father through Jesus (John 14:2-3) (Rom. 11:36).
