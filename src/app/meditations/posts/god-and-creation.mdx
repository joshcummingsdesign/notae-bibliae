## Creator

---

Our worship belongs here alone.

## God

There is one Creator who revealed himself as <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="yhwh" text="YHWH" />, which is a holy name, so in reverence he is called **Lord**. He is more generally called God, but we can also lovingly call him **Father** in the analogous sense, since he is the Father of creation. The Lord also revealed that he is one God in three Persons. In other words, he is three subsistences who perfectly and fully share in the divine essence. These three Persons are the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

### The Father

The Father is the principle without a principle who sends the Son and the Holy Spirit. He is also the heavenly Father of Jesus in the proper sense. He is Home. He is the end of all human desires.

### The Son

**Jesus**, the Son, proceeds from the Father and is sent by him. The Son also sends the Holy Spirit. The Father and the Holy Spirit were revealed through Jesus, so through him we have grace and truth. He is our Savior. He leads us back to the Father.

### The Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son to sanctify us, empower us, and intercede for us. He makes the Son, who reveals the Father, intelligible.

## Creation

---

Our worship belongs to God alone, though we may honor and ask his saints and angels for intercession.

## Heaven

### Angels

Angels are the Lord's messengers. They are spiritual beings created by the Lord, though some of them have fallen.

## Earth

### Man

The Lord created us to rule in a divine partnership with him, but we have fallen. Through faith in Jesus, however, we are reconciled to the Lord in this life, and more fully in the age to come.
