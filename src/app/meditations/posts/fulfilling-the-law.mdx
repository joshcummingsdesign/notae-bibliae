God gave the laws of the Torah to Israel in their cultural and historical context (Deut. 4:44-45).

Behind every law in the Torah is a spiritual principle (Matt. 22:37-40).

Jesus fulfilled every spiritual principle in the Torah (Matt. 5:17).

By faith in God through Jesus Christ, we progressively fulfill the spiritual principles of the Torah through obedience to the Holy Spirit, thus freeing us from the burden of the Law while keeping us in alignment with God's will (Rom. 8:3-4).
