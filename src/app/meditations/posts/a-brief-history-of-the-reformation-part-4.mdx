## The Puritans

As the English Reformation advanced into the late 16th and early 17th centuries, some Protestants felt that things weren't moving quickly enough, and advocated for the creation of independent congregations that would separate from the Church of England completely. These Protestants became known as the "Separatists". In the 1620s, many Separatists fled to America on the Mayflower to escape religious persecution and formed the Plymouth Colony. They become known as the "Pilgrims".[^1]

Other English Protestants sought to "purify" the Church of England from what they considered remnants of Roman Catholic practices.[^2] These Protestants became known as the "Puritans". In the 1630s, many Puritans fled to America and formed the Massachusetts Bay Colony.[^3]

Many Separatists and Puritans adopted a congregational form of church polity. Those who did so became known as "Congregationalists".[^4]

## The Seditious Sectaries Act

In 1593, Queen Elizabeth I, fearing that sectarianism and the rejection of ecclesiastical and civil authority could destabilize the kingdom, enacted the Seditious Sectaries Act. This law imposed severe penalties—including fines, imprisonment, and exile—on those who refused to attend Church of England services, sheltered recusants, or participated in unauthorized religious gatherings.[^5]

## The Scottish Episcopacy Restored

King James VI of Scotland ascended to the English throne when his cousin Elizabeth I died in 1603, thus he became James VI and I.[^6] During his reign, he attempted to reestablish the episcopacy in Scotland. In 1606, the Scottish Parliament removed restrictions placed on the bishop's office, and in 1610, the episcopacy was restored by the Assembly of Glasgow. Within three months, three Scottish bishops were ordained by the Bishops of London.[^7]

## The Baptist Church

In 1606, an Anglican priest named John Smyth became the pastor of a Separatist congregation in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire (eastern England), of which his good friend Thomas Helwys was a member. In 1607, the group left for Amsterdam to avoid persecution under the Seditious Sectaries Act, and began renting a meeting house from a group of Dutch Mennonites.

In contrast to the other Separatist groups of the time, Smyth's congregation maintained that there was only one office of presbyter (as opposed to the Presbyterian view of pastors, teachers, and elders), that no other books but the Bible should be used in worship, and that credobaptism should be affirmed. In 1609, Smyth baptized himself and then Helwys and the other congregants, and the first Baptist church was formed.

In 1610, Helwys and about ten others split from the group when Smyth decided he had been wrong to baptize himself and sought to join the Mennonites and be re-baptized.[^8] Shortly after, in 1611, Helwys wrote *A Declaration of Faith*, the earliest Baptist confession, and *A Short Declaration of the Mystery of Iniquity*, the first English book to defend the principle of religious liberty.[^9]

Risking their lives, Helwys and his followers returned to England in 1612 and founded the first Baptist congregation on English soil in Spitalfields, east London. They brought *The Mystery of Iniquity* with them, and a copy of it was delivered to King James I. It contained a handwritten note from Helwys arguing for liberty of conscience, saying, "The King is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them." Helwys was thrown into Newgate Prison. Appeals were made for his release, but in 1616, he died in prison.[^10]

The Baptists at Spitalfields held to the view of unlimited or "general" atonement. Baptists who shared this view came to be known as "General Baptists".[^11] Baptists who held to the Calvinist view of limited or "particular" atonement became known as "Particular Baptists".[^12] Particular Baptists who practiced closed communion came to be known as "Strict Baptists".[^13] A more general term for Baptists who adhere to a Calvinist soteriology is "Reformed Baptists".

## Roger Williams

Roger Williams was an Anglican priest from London who was educated at Cambridge. In 1630, he decided to leave England and settle with the Puritans in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

William arrived in Boston in 1631, and was invited to be the pastor of a Congregational church. Feeling that the Puritans hadn't separated themselves enough from the Church of England, he declined the offer and set off for the Plymouth Colony to settle with the Separatists. After a short time in the Plymouth Colony, he went to Salem where he became a pastor of a Separatist congregation. There, he advocated for the fair treatment of Native Americans and for the separation of religious and civil orders, the latter for which he was expelled from Salem. In 1636, Williams bought some land from the Native Americans, about 40 miles southwest of Boston, and named it "Providence", saying, "[I had a] sense of God's merciful providence to me in my distress."[^14]

In Providence, Williams established a local government in which the religious and civil orders were separated. He also believed that one should come into the church through voluntary consent, and thus affirmed credobaptism. In 1638, Williams and 11 other settlers organized the First Baptist Church in America.[^15] In 1663, King Charles II granted a charter which established the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, recognizing its government and securing its religious liberties.[^16]

## The Westminster Confession of Faith

At the onset of the English Civil War, the English Parliament attempted to form an alliance with Scotland in opposition to King Charles I, who sought to govern without parliamentary consent. In 1643, an agreement was made called the Solemn League and Covenant, which committed England to adopting Presbyterianism in exchange for Scottish support.[^17] Soon after, a council was convened in Westminster, London, known as the Westminster Assembly.

The Westminster Assembly was made up of theologians and members of Parliament, most of whom were Presbyterians. They were tasked with replacing the *Book of Common Prayer* and the *Thirty-Nine Articles* with a liturgy and confession that was more explicitly Reformed. By 1646, the *Westminster Confession of Faith* was drafted and presented to Parliament. The Scottish Parliament adopted the Confession in 1647, and the English Parliament accepted it in part a year later.[^18]

## The Early Baptist Confessions

In 1644, the first meeting of the General Assembly of the Particular Baptist Churches was held in London. In order to distinguish themselves from the Anabaptists and the General Baptists, they drafted the *First London Confession*.[^19] In response, the General Assembly of the General Baptist Churches met for the first time in London in 1654, which led to the drafting of *A Brief Confession or Declaration of Faith* in 1660. This became the standard General Baptist confession of faith.[^20]

## The Stuart Restoration

King Charles I was executed in 1649, and his son Charles II ascended to the Scottish throne. England operated as a Commonwealth until 1660, when Charles II was restored to the English throne in what became known as the Stuart Restoration.[^21] After the Restoration, the *Book of Common Prayer* and the *Thirty-Nine Articles* were reaffirmed.[^22] In addition, the episcopacy was reinstated in both England and Scotland.[^23]

## De Heretico Comburendo Abolished

In 1677, the English Parliament repealed *De Heretico Comburendo*, stating, "All punishment by death in pursuance of any ecclesiastical censures be from henceforth utterly taken away and abolished."[^24]

## The Act of Toleration

In 1689, the English Parliament passed the Act of Toleration, which allowed Protestants who dissented from the Church of England to worship freely, so long as they swore allegiance to the British Crown.[^25]

## The 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith

In 1677, the General Assembly of the Particular Baptist Churches met in London to draft the *Second London Confession of Faith*, aiming to clarify their doctrine and to show their unity with their Presbyterian and Congregationalist brethren. After the Act of Toleration in 1698, the *Second London Confession of Faith* was revised and formally adopted as the standard Reformed Baptist confession of faith.[^26]

## John Gill

The Rev. Dr. John Gill was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire (central England) on November 23, 1697. His father was a member of a Particular Baptist church led by a teaching elder named William Wallis. In grammar school, Gill displayed a strong aptitude for learning, mastering the Latin classics and acquiring Greek by the age of 11. He continued to study logic, rhetoric, natural and moral philosophy, and taught himself Hebrew, a language he cherished all throughout his life. At the age of 12, Gill heard a sermon from Wallis, on the text, "But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, 'Where are you?'" (Gen. 3:9). It was then that Gill recognized his need of the Savior. Seven years later, he made a public profession of faith and was baptized.

Gill's gift of teaching was quickly realized, and he was asked to preach at the church in Kettering. In late 1719, he was elected pastor of a Strict Baptist church on Horsleydown Lane in Southwark, London—about a mile from the London Bridge—and was ordained in early 1720.

Between 1746 and 1748, Gill published his *Exposition of the Whole New Testament* in three volumes. In 1748, he earned his Doctor of Divinity from Marischal College and University at Aberdeen. In 1756, after almost 40 years of preaching, Gill gave his farewell sermon and turned his attention to finishing his *Exposition of the Whole Old Testament*. In 1757, the church on Horsleydown Lane moved north to Carter Lane near St. Paul's Cathedral. Gill preached two more sermons at Carter Lane. Between 1763 and 1766, he published his *Exposition of the Whole Old Testament* in four volumes.[^27]

John Gill died in 1771. He was the first major writing Baptist theologian, and his work had a profound impact on the Baptist Church. He was succeeded by Rev. Dr. John Rippon. The church at Carter Lane continued to grow and eventually moved south to New Park Street.[^28]

## John Wesley

Rev. John Wesley was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire, England on June 17, 1703. In 1728, he was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. In 1729, John and his younger brother Rev. Charles Wesley started a small group dedicated to the pursuit of a devout Christian life. The group committed themselves to daily prayer, fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays, Bible study, Communion every Sunday, visiting prisoners, and caring for the sick and the needy. Some mockingly called them the "Holy Club", while others came to know them as the "Methodists" because of their methodical devotion and study.[^29][^30][^31]

In 1735, John and Charles Wesley set sail for the Province of Georgia in the American colonies at the request of James Oglethorpe, who wanted John to be the colony's chaplain at the newly-formed Savannah <Definition lang="greek" anchor="paroikia" text="parish" />. During their voyage, the Wesleys came into contact with Moravian settlers (Hussites who fled from Moravia to Germany and then made their way to the American colonies).[^32] John was deeply impacted by their piety, saying, "I had long before observed the great seriousness of their behavior. Of their humility they had given a continual proof, by performing those servile offices for the other passengers, which none of the English would undertake; for which they desired, and would receive no pay, saying, 'it was good for their proud hearts,' and, 'their loving Savior had done more for them.' And every day had given them occasion of showing a meekness which no injury could move. If they were pushed, struck, or thrown down, they rose again and went away; but no complaint was found in their mouth. There was *now* an opportunity of trying whether they were delivered from the spirit of fear, as well as from that of pride, anger, and revenge. In the midst of the psalm wherewith their service began, the sea broke over, split the mainsail in pieces, covered the ship, and poured in between the decks, as if the great deep had already swallowed us up. A terrible screaming began among the English. The [Moravians] calmly sung on. I asked one of them afterwards, 'Was you not afraid?' He answered, 'I thank God, no.' I asked, 'But were not your women and children afraid?' He replied, mildly, 'No; our women and children are not afraid to die.'"[^33]

John and Charles Wesley arrived in Savannah in 1736, but things did not go as smoothly as they had hoped. Charles had bouts of illness, and realized he was not well suited for life in Savannah. After six months, he sailed back to England. John was unpopular with the colonists who largely disapproved of his high-church ministry, and he became entangled in a controversy involving his love interest Sophy Hopkey. In 1737, he too sailed back to England.[^34]

On May 24, 1738, John Wesley attended a Moravian gathering at Aldersgate Street, London—a few blocks away from St. Paul's Cathedral—where he heard a reading from Martin Luther's preface to the Book of Romans. This would forever reshape his faith and his ministry. Wesley recalls, "In the evening I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate Street, where one was reading Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death."

All this time Wesley had believed that becoming righteous was a prerequisite for justification, but now he was convinced that justification is a free gift that marks the beginning of the process of sanctification. He said, "I was striving, yea, fighting with all my might under the Law, as well as under grace. But then I was sometimes, if not often, conquered; now, I was always conqueror." Wesley then spent the next three months in Germany visiting the Moravians.[^35][^36]

Wesley returned to England, and in 1739, Anglican priest George Whitefield—who himself had a spiritual awakening—invited Wesley to preach to the poor coal workers of Bristol. Wesley reluctantly accepted, and when he arrived, he preached to a crowd of over 3,000 people.[^37] Wesley continued to travel and preach, and as the Methodist movement grew, he appointed lay preachers to assist him in the work of the ministry.[^38] Public preaching to the marginalized contributed to the great success of the Methodist movement, though it was often met with resistance from the established church, sometimes even leading to riots.[^39]

Over time, Methodists organized into small groups called "societies" which met once a week in the evening to focus on prayer, mutual support, and spiritual growth. As societies grew larger, they were organized into smaller groups called "classes", each led by a class leader responsible for spiritual oversight.[^40]

By 1741, Wesley could no longer find common ground with George Whitefield on the issue of predestination.[^41] Wesley rejected Calvinism, and although Arminius' work was not a direct influence on him, he adopted the term "Arminianism" to distinguish his theology from that of his Calvinist opponents.[^42] Later theologians explained Wesley's view of God's grace as being fourfold: *Prevenient Grace* (the universal grace that precedes human decision and action and prepares one's heart to respond to God's salvation), *Justifying Grace* (the grace by which God forgives sinners and restores their relationship with him through faith in Christ), *Sanctifying Grace* (the ongoing grace that works in believers to transform them on their journey to Christ-likeness), and *Glorifying Grace* (the final grace that completes salvation, transforming believers in the resurrection).[^43][^44]

As Methodism continued to grow, the question of division arose in the Church of England. Wesley urged Methodists to remain in the established church and adhere to its laws, so long as a safe conscience could be maintained.[^45]

## The Revolutionary War

When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, the Bishop of London no longer had jurisdiction over the Anglicans in the thirteen former British colonies. This raised a critical question: How could these newly-independent Americans maintain valid Sacraments without swearing allegiance to the British Crown?[^46]

## The Methodist Church

John Wesley was eager to assist the Methodists in America after the Revolutionary War. He petitioned the Bishop of London to ordain a bishop for America, but his request was rejected. In 1784, Wesley believed he could no longer wait, and resolved to ordain Thomas Coke as superintendent to organize and lead the Methodists in America. Wesley was driven by his conviction that the office of bishop—as distinct from the presbyters—developed out of human delegation rather than divine ordinance, and that it was not without precedent for a presbyter to perform ordinations in extraordinary circumstances.

Wesley abridged the *Thirty-Nine Articles* of the Church of England for the Methodist work in America, removing the articles that were either specific to England's governance or were explicitly Calvinistic. The resulting *Twenty-Five Articles* are also referred to as the *Articles of Religion*.[^47][^48]

Coke traveled to Baltimore, MD, where the famous Christmas Conference was held. During the Conference, Coke ordained Francis Asbury as co-superintendent. This marked the establishment of the Methodist Episcopal Church.[^49][^50] Over time, the word "Episcopal" was dropped.[^51]

## The Episcopal Church

Samuel Seabury, an American from Connecticut who had been ordained as an Anglican priest, was eager to find a way to restore the episcopacy after the Revolutionary War. In 1784, he traveled to Aberdeen Scotland, where the Scottish Episcopal Church agreed to ordain him as a bishop on the condition that he study the Scottish rite of Holy Communion and work for its adoption. In 1786, the English Parliament passed legislation allowing for the ordination of three bishops for the American church. The following year, William White of Pennsylvania and Samuel Provoost of New York were ordained in England. In 1789, a General Convention was held in Philadelphia, which affirmed the validity of Seabury's ordination. In 1790, James Madison of Virginia became the third American bishop to be ordained in England. In 1792, Seabury, White, Provoost, and Madison ordained Thomas Claggett as bishop of Maryland. This marked the establishment of an American episcopacy and the formation of what would become the Episcopal Church.[^52]

## Conclusion

We've only begun to scratch the surface of the rich history of the Reformation, but I hope this brief introduction gives you a deeper appreciation of how and why it came about, and why we see many denominations in the body of Christ today. I also hope that it serves as a catalyst for more prayer and thoughtful study on the topic, which in turn leads to less caricatures and more ecumenical dialog. Finally, I pray that we "make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace" (Eph. 4:1-3).

Amen.
