# Strange Fire

## Nadab and Abihu

In Leviticus, we read a story about Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu waltzing into God's presence (Lev. 10:1), perhaps drunk (Lev. 10:9), offering unauthorized fire before the Lord, and they are consumed by the fire (Lev. 10:2). Nadab and Abihu treated God's presence like it was something they owned, and their story reminds us that we are in *his* temple, and have a special responsibility to uphold his name through our words and our actions.

## The Philistines and the Ark

We see a similar situation play out in 1 Samuel. Without seeking God's counsel, the Israelites bring the ark of the covenant into battle against the Philistines, again treating God's presence as if it is something they owned (1 Sam. 4:3). Not only are they defeated, but the Philistines capture the ark of the covenant (1 Sam 4:11). This story reminds us that we are carrying *his* ark, and have a special responsibility to carry it with honor and humility.

## The Holy Spirit

Just as the Israelites were in God's temple, and had the responsibility of carrying his ark, so too we are in *his* Holy Spirit. This means everything we say and do should be in God's name, recognizing that we are in *his* presence, and that we have a special responsibility to speak, act, and honor God with dignity and care.
