In the beginning, God created our first parents in his image to rule in a divine partnership with him (Gen. 1:26). They had everything they needed to flourish. They had communion with God and eternal life, and in his wisdom, God gave them free will to know and experience love and trust (Gen. 2:9).

Man's reason and will, or "higher powers", were subject to God.

Man's passions, emotions, and instincts, or "lower powers", were subject to reason.

There was an ordered relationship between God and man, and within man himself.

This is called "original justice" ([Aquinas on Romans, par. 335](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~Rom.C4.L1.n335.3)).

With original justice man not only had eternal life, but in full submission to God he could see what was good, affirm its proper place and purpose, and respond in a righteous manner.

In the fall, however, our first parents, tempted by Satan, used their free will in an unintended way. Instead of using it to know and experience love and trust, they used it to break the ordered subjugation of their reason to God, thereby creating a privation of original justice, which in turn was instantiated in human nature and passed down through the generations. Thus, we are no longer born in a state of original justice, but rather in a state tending toward a disordered relationship between God and man, and within man himself, where death is a reality.

This is called "original sin" (Rom 5:12).

Without our higher powers subjugated to God, all of our powers selfishly and impetuously drive full force toward their individual end (Rom. 8:7). For example, our reason drives toward the attainment of knowledge, even if it is improper for us to do so. Our concupiscence (desire for food, drink, and sexual intimacy) drives toward sensual pleasure and perpetuating the species without regard for what is right or wrong. Our will drives toward the attainment of its own good above that of others or even that of God. These are just a few examples of the calamity that ensues due to original sin, and the problem is exacerbated by Satan who exploits this vulnerability within us and tempts us at every turn.

When original sin and Satan drive us to transgress, we commit what is called "actual sin" ([Aquinas on Romans, par. 349](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~Rom.C5.L3.n409.2)).

Between original sin, the temptation of Satan, and our relentless committing of actual sin, it becomes clear that as humans we are stuck in a position where we cannot save ourselves, for even when we long for the good, we end up doing the things that we hate (Rom. 7:19). In this way, we are slaves to sin, and we need a Redeemer.

The good news is that God didn't leave us to die in our sins. He took it upon himself to enter into our broken world and become man, to lead us, teach us, heal us, and forgive us. He suffered and died for us to demonstrate his self-giving love and mercy, to point out the iniquity in our innermost heart, and to pay in solidarity the spiritual debt that accumulated due to our individual and collective sins. He rose again, to not only prove that what he did and said was true, but to give us hope that Satan, sin, and death don't get the final say. He gave us the Holy Spirit to walk with us day in and day out, constantly pointing us to his truth, sanctifying us, and ultimately allowing us to progressively recommit our higher powers to God which in turn govern our lower powers in accordance with his will and righteousness (Rom. 8:3-4) (1 Peter 4:1-2). Thus, we take up our cross and follow him in this life, in view of eventual resurrection, glorification, and eternal life in the age to come.
