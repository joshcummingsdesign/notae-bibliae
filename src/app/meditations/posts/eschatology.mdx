Eschatology is the study of last things. We begin our study of eschatology in the Book of Revelation. Revelation is a very challenging prophetic book written by St. John, but in it contains many truths of the Christian faith. While there are many differing views on Christian eschatology, we will try to look at the Scriptures more generally, rather than argue for any one position. This will give us a starting point from which to understand Christian eschatology, but needless to say, much more prayer and study is needed on the topic.

## Comfort and Joy

We start our eschatological journey in the Book of Revelation where John sees God's heavenly throne room (Rev. 1:12-13). It is important to note that when we speak of "heaven", we are talking about "God's space", the unapproachable light in which God dwells, which he plans on bringing here on earth (Matt. 6:10) (1 Tim. 6:16). When John sees Jesus, he falls at his feat as though dead. This highlights the fear one has toward an infinitely holy God. A similar fear is seen in Isaiah (Isa. 6:5). But John is not left there face down. God comforts him. Jesus lays his right hand on him and says, "Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore" (Rev. 1:17-18). What great comfort! Jesus is telling John not to fear because he, the Image to whom we are to be conformed, died yet lives forevermore (Rom. 8:29-30). He's showing John the eternal comfort that he can look forward to (Matt. 11:28). Further, he tells John, "I have the keys of Death and Hades" (Rev: 1:18). Not only can we rest in Christ, but we shall fear no evil because he's above even Death and Hades (Ps. 23:4) (Matt. 16:18).

**Takeaway:** We have rest in Christ Jesus, who has delivered us from sin and death to give us eternal life.

## Those Who Have Fallen Asleep

Paul tells us that through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep (1 Thess. 4:13-14) (John 11:11).

In John's vision of God's heavenly throne room, he sees 24 <Definition lang="greek" anchor="presbuteros" text="elders" /> on thrones (Rev. 4:4) (Dan. 7:9-10). Elders are representatives chosen by God to shepherd the people (Num. 11:16) (1 Peter 5:1-3). Peter tells us that good shepherds receive the crown of glory from Christ (1 Peter 5:4).

But why 24, and who are the elders that John sees? There are 12 tribes of Israel which represent the patriarchs (Matt. 8:11) and 12 apostles (Matt. 19:28), there are 24 books of the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 17:3), and there were 24 divisions of priests serving God in the temple (1 Chron. 24:18-19), so 24 is a fitting number of elders for John to see serving in God's heavenly throne room. The 24 elders represent all of the heroes of the faith who came before us, who have received the crown of glory from Christ (Rev. 3:21), which they throw at his feet in humility (Rev. 4:10-11). They are representatives of God's people, who are from every tribe and every nation (Rev. 5:8-10).

Scripture tells us that when we die, our spirit returns to God who gave it (Ecc. 12:7) (Acts 7:59). When Jesus told his parable of the rich man and Lazarus, he explained that Lazarus was carried by the angels to the bosom of Abraham (Luke 16:22). Jesus also told the thief on the cross that when he died he would be with him in paradise (Luke 23:43). Stephen asked the Lord Jesus to receive him as he was being martyred (Acts 7:59). Thus, if the saints are in heaven with Christ, it follows that *all* those in Christ who have died in this age are there as well.

Those whom John sees in his vision with Christ are clothed in white garments to signify their justification before God (Rev. 7:14). Paul explains that we will *all* appear before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10), but the author of Hebrews reminds us that those in Christ may approach the throne of grace with confidence (Heb. 4:15-16), and the Psalms remind us that he will judge the world with righteousness (Ps. 98:8-9).

**Takeaway:** When we die in this age, we go to be with God, who in himself is the source of all our desires and actions ([Aquinas on John, par. 1883](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~Ioan.C14.L3.n1883)); and though we will be judged before his throne of grace, we will be with him in paradise.

## This Age and the Age to Come

Jesus spoke of "this age" and the "age to come". "This age" refers to God's kingdom movement on earth before Jesus' return, in which we have eternal life in him (Matt. 4:17) (Matt. 12:32) (John 5:24). "The age to come" refers to the time after Jesus' return when God's kingdom comes on earth as it is in heaven, in which we will have eternal life in him more fully (Mark 10:29-30). The age to come also entails the resurrection of life and the resurrection of judgment (John 5:28-29) (Dan. 12:2). God, being perfectly just, has to deal with sin and evil (Mic. 6:8).

**Takeaway:** The kingdom of God is at hand. Through Christ we have eternal life, and we will have eternal life more fully in the age to come.

## Signs of the End of the Age

When the disciples ask Jesus on the Mount of Olives what the signs of his coming and the end of the age will be (Matt. 24:3), he tells them about three distinct periods of time:

1. This Age
2. The Great Tribulation
3. The Second Coming

First, he tells them that there will be false prophets (Matt. 24:5), war, earthquakes, famine, pestilence (Luke 21:10-11), and persecution (Matt. 24:9), but makes it clear that these are *not* signs of his coming, *nor* are they signs of the end of the age (Matt. 24:6) (Matt. 24:8). We will consider these events as part of this age.

Second, he tells them that the Antichrist will emerge (Matt. 24:15-16) (Dan. 9:27) (Dan. 11:31) (Dan. 12:11-12) (2 Thess. 2:3-4), which will be the sign of the beginning of what is called the Great Tribulation (Matt. 24:21).

Third, he tells them that the Great Tribulation will be cut short for the sake of the elect (Matt. 24:22), and that there will be obvious cosmic signs of his return (Matt. 24:29-30). He tells them that this is when he will gather his elect (Matt. 24:31). We will call his return the Second Coming, and we will call the gathering of his elect the Rapture.

**Takeaway:** At the end of the age, there will be two distinct periods of time: the Great Tribulation, marked by the emergence of the Antichrist, and the Second Coming, which immediately precedes the Rapture.

## The Millennium

In John's vision, he sees an angel come down from heaven with the key to the bottomless pit (Rev. 20:1). The angel binds Satan, throws him into the pit, and seals it shut (Rev. 20:2-3). John then sees the saints brought back to life in the "first resurrection". They then reign with Christ for "a thousand years". This precedes the resurrection of judgment (Rev. 20:4-5). John tells us that those who share in the "first resurrection" will not experience the "second death" (Rev. 20:6).

**Takeaway:** Jesus binds Satan, and his saints will not experience the "second death".

## The Antichrist

Scripture tells us that when we are humble and God exalts us, we become victorious (1 Sam. 17:50); but when we are prideful and we exalt ourselves, we becomes beasts (Dan. 11:36). Self-exaltation is the work of Satan, who in every time and season tempts man. The ultimate expression of this reaches its climax in the one who is called the Antichrist, the visible image of invisible evil (1 John 4:3) (Rev. 14:11).

Jesus tells us that before the Second Coming, lawlessness will be increased (Matt. 24:12) and false prophets will arise (Matt. 24:24), and that this all culminates in the emergence of the Antichrist (Matt. 24:15-16) (Dan. 9:27) (Dan. 11:31) (Daniel 12:11-12) (2 Thess. 2:3-4). During this time, the saints are called to endure (Rev. 13:10). Jesus says that the one who endures to the end will be saved (Matt. 24:13).

**Takeaway:** The emergence of the Antichrist marks the beginning of the Great Tribulation, at which time we will be called to endure until the Second Coming. Those who endure to the end will be saved.

## The Second Coming

Jesus tells us that at the time of the Great Tribulation, he will return to gather his elect (Matt. 24:29-31), but both he and Paul warn us not to let others alarm us or lead us astray about the Second Coming because it will be perfectly clear to us when the time comes (Matt. 24:26-28) (2 Thess. 2:1-2). Jesus does, however, tell us to be prepared for the Second Coming through our faith and our actions (Matt. 24:42).

**Takeaway:** Jesus' return will be perfectly clear to us, and we need not stress or speculate about it, nor believe anyone falsely claiming to be the Christ.

## The Seven Seals

Now let's look at John's vision as it relates to the Great Tribulation and the Second Coming. John sees Jesus handed a scroll with seven seals, and Jesus begins to open each seal one by one (Rev. 5:5). As Jesus opens the first five seals, John sees tyranny (Rev. 6:2), war (Rev. 6:4), famine (Rev. 6:6), pestilence (Rev. 6:8), and persecution (Rev. 6:9). This directly corresponds to the events of this age that Jesus warned his disciples about (Matt. 24:7-8).

Later, John sees Satan give his power to the Antichrist (Rev. 12:9) (Rev. 13:1-2), followed by the emergence of a false prophet who tries to force people into worshiping the Antichrist (Rev. 13:11-12) (Rev. 13:14-15) (Dan. 3:4-5). This directly corresponds to what Jesus told his disciples about the emergence of the Antichrist (Matt. 24:15-16).

Then as Jesus opens the sixth seal, John sees the cosmic signs of the Second Coming (Rev. 6:12-13).

Before Jesus opens the seventh seal, however, John sees "a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages" standing before God's throne in white garments, rejoicing and praising the Savior (Rev. 7:9-10). John is seeing Christ's church redeemed.

Lastly, Jesus opens the seventh seal, and God's judgment is poured out on the earth during the remainder of the Great Tribulation (Rev. 8:5). This indicates that the Great Tribulation had been cut short for the elect as Jesus had stated (Matt. 24:22).

**Takeaway:** God will deliver us from the Great Tribulation, and we will stand before his throne rejoicing and praising our Savior.

## The Rapture

The word "rapture" comes from the Latin word *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="raptura" text="raptura" />* which is the future active participle of *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="rapio" text="rapio" />* which means "to carry off". Its Greek form *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="harpazo" text="harpazo" />* is most notably found in 1 Thessalonians 4:17, which describes how Christ will come to redeem his church.

In John's vision, before Jesus opens the seventh seal, he sees four angels holding back the four winds of heaven (Rev. 7:1). Then he hears an angel ordering that the "sons of Israel" (144,000 or 12,000 from the 12 tribes of Israel) who are servants of God be sealed (Rev. 7:3-4), and later sees them redeemed by the Lord (Rev. 14:1). John also sees "a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages" standing standing before God's throne, justified by their faith in Christ (Rev. 7:9). One of the elders tells John that these are the ones coming out of the Great Tribulation (Rev. 7:14).

But how did they get there? Jesus tells us that at the Second Coming he will receive us to himself (John 14:2-3). Paul tells us that at the Second Coming, the dead in Christ will rise first, and then the living in Christ will be "caught up with" them in the clouds to meet Jesus (1 Thess. 4:16-17) (cf. the word "clouds" in Ex. 13:21). Paul also tells us at this time we will be glorified (1 Cor. 15:51-53) (Col. 3:4).

**Takeaway:** Upon Jesus' return, we are all at once glorified, received by Christ, delivered from the Great Tribulation, and reunited with our loved ones.

## The Great Tribulation

During the Great Tribulation, John sees "a star" fall from heaven and receive the key to the bottomless pit from which comes five months of havoc (Rev. 9:1). God then releases the angels holding back the four winds of heaven (Rev. 9:14-15).

The followers of the Antichrist, who John fittingly calls Babylon (Rev. 16:19), assemble for battle at <Definition lang="greek" anchor="harmagedon" text="Armageddon"/> (Greek for Mount Megiddo) (Rev. 16:16) (Judg. 5:19) (2 Kings 23:29). Satan is released and deceives the nations, who John fittingly calls Gog and Magog. Satan gathers them for battle and they surround the "camp of the saints" (Rev. 20:7-9) (Ezek 38:18) (Ezek. 39:6).

Then, Jesus comes on a white horse with the armies of heaven to strike down the nations with the "sword of his mouth" (Rev. 19:11) (Rev. 19:15). The Antichrist is then thrown into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20) (Dan. 7:10-11) (2 Thess. 2:8). Finally, God throws Satan into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:9-10).

**Takeaway:** In the Great Tribulation, God will defeat Satan once and for all.

## The Final Judgment

After the defeat of Satan comes the resurrection of judgment where all the dead are raised to stand before God's throne to be judged (Rev. 20:11-12). Anyone whose name is not in the Book of Life is thrown into the lake of fire along with Death and Hades themselves. The "second death" is the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14-15) (Ex. 32:33) (Ps. 69:28) (Dan. 7:10) (Matt. 13:29-30).

**Takeaway:** After the defeat of Satan, the dead will rise in the resurrection of judgment to stand before God's throne where he will deal with sin and death once and for all.

## The Kingdom Comes

God loves us more than we can imagine and is not content with leaving us to die in our sins (1 Tim. 2:4) (2 Peter 3:9). He wants to redeem us in such a way that renews everything. In the end, he will wipe every tear from our eyes, and death shall be no more (Rev. 21:4). We will see a new heaven and a new earth, and we will have peace (Rev. 21:1) (Ps. 65:7). We will see a new heavenly Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2) where streets are made of gold (Rev. 21:21). There will be no temple because God will be there with us (Rev. 21:22). The river of life will flow through the city (Rev. 22:1) (Gen. 2:10) (Isa. 44:3) (Ezek. 47:9) (Zech. 14:8), and the fruit of the tree of life will be available to all (Rev. 22:2) (Gen. 3:22) (John 3:16).
