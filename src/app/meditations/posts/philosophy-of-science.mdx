## Argumentation

- **Premise**

  - What we presuppose.

- **Conclusion**

  - What we conclude from the premise.

## Deductive Reasoning

Top down, i.e. you use a premise to form a conclusion.

- A = B (premise)
- C is A
- So, C = B (conclusion)

This relies on the premise being true.

## Inductive Reasoning

Bottom up, i.e. you create a theory based on observation or <Definition lang="greek" anchor="empeirikos" text="empirical" /> evidence.

- I observe many times that A is B
- So, I theorize that A = B

This relies on theoretical beliefs.

## Presuppositions

The most important arguments in science use inductive reasoning. That means science doesn't just rely on observations, it relies on theoretical beliefs. We call these theoretical beliefs presuppositions. This means that scientists will always have a certain bias, or make observations from a certain perspective that will influence their conclusions.

## Paradigm

Coined by the 20th century American philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, a <Definition lang="greek" anchor="paradeigma" text="paradigm" /> consists of all the presuppositions that scientists take for granted in their field of study. This allows scientists to make progress in their area of emphasis, however, when there are too many anomalies in an accepted paradigm, there is often a crisis that leads to a paradigm shift.

## Conclusion

While we should be grateful for science and its contributions to our understanding of the world, we must remember that it operates within a lens or paradigm. We must humble ourselves and realize that we see as if in a mirror dimly (1 Cor. 13:12). God has graciously given us the gift of intellect that we may reason about his beautiful and infinitely-complex world, while at the same time humbling us in fear and trembling, that we may rely upon him, which is our ultimate purpose (see [Aquinas on Man's Purpose](/meditations/aquinas-on-mans-purpose)). Paradigms shift, but God, the unmoved mover, is a stable rock, a fortress; in him we shall not be greatly shaken (Ps. 62:2).
