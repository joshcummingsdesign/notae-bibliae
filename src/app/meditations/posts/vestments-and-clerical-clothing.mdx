## Vestments

---

Vestments have been used since as early as the 4th century to set apart members of the clergy—who are representatives of the people before God, and of God before the people—for the service of the Lord. They also serve to remind us of the dignity of the human person who is called to communion with God in the Sacraments. Each vestment has both a practical and symbolic purpose.

### Amice

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="amictus" text="amice" /> consists of a white cloth connected to two long ribbon-like attachments by which it is fastened. The garment is draped over the shoulders with the ribbons crossed over the chest, brought around to the back, and then brought forward again to be tied in front around the waist. Its practical purpose is to collect sweat around the neck. Its symbolic purpose is twofold. First, it is put over the head as the "helmet of salvation" (Eph. 6:17), then is moved to the shoulders as the "armor of God" (Eph. 6:11).

### Alb

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="tunica-alba" text="alb" /> is a long white robe. The alb is meant to remind us of Holy Baptism, in which we have been washed in the blood of the Lamb (Rev. 7:14) and clothed in white (Rev. 3:5).

### Cincture

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="cinctura" text="cincture" /> is a rope-like belt encircling the body around the waist. It signifies the purity of Christ, in that we ask for his grace to purify our hearts always anew.

### Stole

The <Definition lang="greek" anchor="stole" text="stole" /> is a decorated band worn on the back of the neck, each end hanging over the chest. It is a symbol of ordination, in which the ordained takes upon himself the yoke of Christ (Matt. 11:29). A water yoke, for example, allows one to carry twice as much water, yet with grace and with ease. That is what Christ does for us, he helps us carry our burdens and our crosses with the help of his grace. The stole also symbolizes the bonds and fetters with which Jesus was bound during his Passion, which is why the stole is usually ornamented with a cross. The stole is typically the liturgical color of the particular service being observed.

### Chasuble

The word chasuble comes from the Latin word <Definition lang="latin" anchor="casula" text="casula" />, which means "little house", as it once had a hood that resembled a little house. It is the outermost vestment worn by clergy and, like the stole, is typically the liturgical color of the particular service being observed.

## Clerical Clothing

---

Clerical clothing is non-liturgical clothing worn exclusively by clergy. It is distinct from vestments in that it is not reserved specifically for use in the liturgy.

### Clerical Collar

By 1840, Anglican clergy had developed a distinct sense of separation from the secular world, one visible manifestation of which was the adoption of distinctive clerical attire. This practice began with the black coat and white necktie. The clerical collar was invented in 1865 by Donald McLeod, a minister in the Church of Scotland. Its adoption in the Anglican, Methodist, Catholic, and Lutheran churches soon followed. The black represents humility and the white represents purity. Worn around the neck, the white collar represents that the pastor has taken the yoke of Christ upon himself (Matt. 11:29), and that he is speaking as a representative of the Lord.
