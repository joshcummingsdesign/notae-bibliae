Leavened or unleavened bread? Wine or grape juice? These and other questions may arise as one begins to contemplate history and tradition of the Holy Eucharist. Let us by the grace of God attempt to answer these questions, at least in part, in order that we may have a better understanding about how the ancient church celebrated the Lord's Supper.

## The Bread

### Eastern and Western Assumptions

The Bible does not specify whether leavened or unleavened bread was used when Jesus instituted the Lord's supper. The relevant passages use the Greek word *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="artos" text="artos" />*, which simply means "bread". Thus, two different assumptions have been made historically with regards to the celebration of the Eucharist.

The first assumption, made by the Eastern Church, is that because the Bible doesn't use the Greek word *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="azumos" text="azumos" />*, which means "unleavened bread", it implies that leavened bread was used when Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper.

The second assumption, made by the Western Church, is that because Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper at the Passover Seder, one can infer that unleavened bread was used (Ex. 12:8-11) (Luke 22:14-15).

### The East and West Reach an Impasse

In 1053, the Eastern and Western churches reached an impasse on the matter when Eastern archbishop Leo of Ohrid wrote a letter to Western bishop John of Trani condemning the West's use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist. The letter was given to Pope Leo IX, and needless to say, things did *not* go well.

Although the East and West remain divided on the which type of bread should be used in the Eucharist, we can gain a lot of spiritual insight from looking at the rich symbolism on both sides.

### The Significance of Leaven

Leaven has a special significance in the Bible as relating to one's works. Our works, good or bad, have an effect on the "lump", that is the congregation. Good works, like good leaven, can enhance the lump, while bad works, like bad leaven, can spoil the lump; and the Leaven of good works is Christ.

> **"He told them another parable. 'The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.'"**
>
> <cite>Matthew 13:33</cite>

> **"Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."**
>
> <cite>1 Corinthians 5:6-8</cite>

> **"If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches."**
>
> <cite>Romans 11:16</cite>

[St. Ignatius of Antioch](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers/ignatius-of-antioch) picks up on this theme in his letter to the Magnesians.

> "Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be salted in him, lest any one among you should be corrupted, since by your savour you shall be convicted."
>
> <cite>[Ignatius, Epistle to the Magnesians, ch. 10](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0105.htm)</cite>

As does [St. Irenaeus](/people/saints/greek-fathers/irenaeus-of-lyon) in *Against Heresies*.

> "Paul declared when he said, 'And if the first-fruits be holy, the lump is also holy' (Rom. 11:16)…that 'the lump' meant us, that is, [the church], the lump of which they say he assumed, and blended it with himself, inasmuch as he is 'the leaven.'"
>
> <cite>[Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1.8.3](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103108.htm)</cite>

As does [St. John Chrysostom](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-chrysostom) in his third homily on the devil.

> "For on this account, as I have before said, God has suffered men to be with one another, and especially the wicked with the good, in order that they may bring them over to their own virtue. Hear at least what Christ saith to his disciples, 'The Kingdom of heaven is like unto a woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal.' (Matt. 13:33). So that the righteous have the power of leaven, in order that they may transfer the wicked to their own manner of conduct. But the righteous are few, for the leaven is small. But the smallness in no way injures the lump, but that little quantity converts the whole of the meal to itself by means of the power inherent in it. So accordingly the power also of the righteous has its force not in the magnitude of their number, but in the grace of the Spirit. There were twelve apostles. Do you see how little is the leaven? The whole world was in unbelief. Do you see how great is the lump? But those twelve turned the whole world to themselves. The leaven and the lump had the same nature but not the same manner of conduct. On this account he left the wicked in the midst of the good, that since they are of the same nature as the righteous they may also become of the same purpose."

### The Significance of Leavened Bread

We can see from the aforementioned passages that leaven can be associated with the good works of regenerate believers who put their faith in Christ, who is the true Leaven of the kingdom of God. Leavened bread is associated with daily bread (Matt. 6:9-13), the bread which sustains all people—even servants and commoners—as Christ is the bread from heaven who comes to *all* who put their faith in him (John 6:35-40). Leavened bread was brought along side thanksgiving offerings in the temple to sustain the priests (Lev. 7:13-14). Lastly, leaven makes bread rise, which ought to remind us of the risen Christ.

### The Significance of Unleavened Bread

The analogy of leaven still applies in the Western tradition, but the emphasis is placed more heavily on leaven being associated with sin (Matt. 16:11-12). Further, unleavened bread connects the Lord's Supper with the Passover (Ex. 12:8-11) (Luke 22:14-15), at which Christ is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29). It recounts that Christ is our true Passover who brought us from death to eternal life (John 3:16).

## The Wine

### The History of Diluted Wine

Like the bread, the Bible does not specify what kind of wine ought to be used in the Eucharist, but we know from St. Paul that it was fermented enough to make one drunk.

> **"When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat. For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk."**
>
> <cite>1 Corinthians 11:20-21</cite>

We can also infer from history what kind of wine may have been used. Wine in the ancient world, because of its strength, was often diluted with water. Plato in the 4th century BC, for example, criticized the practice of not diluting wine with water, equating it with drunkenness ([Plato, Laws, 1.637d-e](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D637d)). Mixing wine with water also ensured that there would be enough of it. We can see this in the 16th-century Jewish text *Shulchan Aruch* (Hebrew: שֻׁלְחָן עָרוּך, "Set Table"), the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written, where it was lawful to add water to the wine from the *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="kiddush" text="Kiddush" />* to make sure there was enough wine for the *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="havdalah" text="Havdalah" />* ([Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayim 271:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.271.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)).

The practice of mixing water and wine continued on into early Christianity. We can see this in the writings of [St. Justin Martyr](/people/saints/greek-fathers/justin-martyr) for example.

> "There is then brought to the [elder] of the brethren bread and a cup of wine mixed with water; and he taking them, gives praise and glory to the Father of the universe, through the name of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and offers thanks at considerable length for our being counted worthy to receive these things at His hands. And when he has concluded the prayers and thanksgivings, all the people present express their assent by saying Amen…And when the [elder] has given thanks, and all the people have expressed their assent…deacons give to each of those present…the bread and wine mixed with water over which the thanksgiving was pronounced…And this food is called among us the Eucharist, of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh."
>
> <cite>[Justin Martyr, The First Apology, ch. 65-66](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm)</cite>

### The Significance of Diluted Wine

The early Christians saw a special spiritual significance in the mixing of water and wine in the Eucharist, for water in the Bible is often linked to the Spirit (John 7:38-39). We can see this in the writings of [Clement of Alexandria](/people/scholars/clement-of-alexandria) for example.

> "The blood of the Lord is twofold. For there is the blood of His flesh, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and the spiritual [blood], by which we are anointed. And to drink the blood of Jesus, is to become partaker of the Lord's immortality; the Spirit being the energetic principle of the Word, as blood is of flesh.
>
> Accordingly, as wine is blended with water, so is the Spirit with man…The mixture of wine and water nourishes [our] faith…the Spirit [leads us] to immortality.
>
> And the mixture of both—of the water and of the Word—is called Eucharist, renowned and glorious grace; and they who by faith partake of it are sanctified both in body and soul. For the divine mixture, man, the Father's will has mystically compounded by the Spirit and the Word. For, in truth, the Spirit is joined to the soul, which is inspired by it; and the flesh, by reason of which the Word became flesh, to the Word."
>
> <cite>[Clement, Paedagogus, 2.2:4-6](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02092.htm)</cite>

In addition to the making the connection between the water and wine in the Eucharist to the two natures of Christ (human and divine), early Christians would have also immediately made the connection between the water and wine in the Eucharist to the water and blood that flowed from Christ's side when he was pierced on the cross (John 19:34).

## Conclusion

Though the Bible does not explicitly state what sort of bread and wine ought to be used in the Eucharist, one thing remains clear, there is a true beauty in the significance and meaning found in each one of these interpretations that allow our hearts to draw near to God in the Sacrament.
