We were never created to live a life apart from God (see [Aquinas on Man's Purpose](/meditations/aquinas-on-mans-purpose)), but we chose to turn our back on him and live for ourselves (Gen. 3:6) (Isa. 59:2). We were in a debt of sin (Matt. 6:12), but God in his mercy took unto himself a people through which, he foretold, he would bless all nations (Gen. 22:18).

That people, Israel, although delivered physically from harsh slavery in Egypt (Ex. 12:13), remained in a debt of sin (Ex. 13:2), thus God could not dwell in their midst (Ex. 33:3). Through Moses' intercession, God showed mercy unto Israel (Ex. 33:16), and gave them his Law that they may know his righteous requirements, and that he may graciously dwell in their midst, despite all their failures and hardness of heart (Ex. 34:27). Seeing the Law carnally, and striving to fulfill it by might, Israel was unable to fulfill its precepts (2 Cor. 3:14), thus demonstrating that alas we cannot (Rom. 8:7). Thus the Law, which is holy and good (Rom. 7:12), became a form of debt slavery that condemned us to death (Rom. 7:5).

Once again in his great mercy, God sent the prophets to call us to turn from our stubbornness, and to foretell of an even greater salvation to come (Micah 5:2). Jesus, the only Son of God, whose coming was foretold by the prophets, called all people unto himself, that we may join his family (John 3:16). Then, he paid with his life on our behalf the payment required to free us not only from our debt of sin and the crushing burden we made of the Law, but from sin and death itself (Rom. 6:7-9).

Thus, God through Christ has given us an even greater deliverance than our fathers, and has once more taken unto himself a people, not based on pedigree or merit, but by the merits of his only Son, Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:8). Now, having recognized our inability to fulfill the Law by our own striving, and having seen how Christ has fulfilled it on our behalf, we live transformed, reborn, anew (2 Cor. 5:17). Having been purified, God gives us his Holy Spirit, through whom we see that in the Law is the heart of our most gracious Father in heaven (Rom. 7:6). We then look to Christ in order to live a life of self-sacrificing love toward God and neighbor (1 Pet. 2:21).

Amen.
