When God became man in Jesus, he didn't cease to be God.

It is the eternal source of his divinity that Jesus calls Father.

Jesus only does the will of the Father, and they have communion, thus he says, "I am in the Father and the Father is in me" (John 14:11).

Just as Jesus has a shared divinity with the Father, so too he has a shared humanity with us, thus he says, "I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you" (John 14:20).

Just as you and I have a spirit, so too God has the Holy Spirit.

The Father sends us the Holy Spirit in Jesus' name, with whom we have communion forever. So it becomes, "I am in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is in me."

As disciples of Jesus, we are united in Jesus by the Holy Spirit. So we become the body of Christ with Christ at the head.

The Holy Spirit surrounds us and permeates our lives, thus everything we do is in the name of Jesus. His prayers to "My Father" become our prayers to "our Father" (Matt. 6:9), all of our works are through Jesus, and all of our words are in Jesus' name (Ps 51:15).

If we sin, the Holy Spirit convicts us, and Jesus gives us the words of repentance to pray to the Father in Jesus' name. If we bless someone, it isn't our own doing, it's in Jesus' power. If we want the truth, the Holy Spirit tunes our ear to Jesus and graciously gives us understanding.

And what is truly astounding is that because we are united with Jesus by the Holy Spirit, we are also united with the Father, thus being reconciled to him forever in this life, and even more fully in the age to come.
