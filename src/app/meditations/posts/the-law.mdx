The Law, being perfectly good and holy, exposes our brokenness and condemns us, for we learn that as much as our mind wants to uphold it, we don't because of the flesh (original sin). We realize that our higher powers have become subject to our lower powers instead of God, thereby causing us to sin relentlessly, even though we desire the good. Original sin drives us to transgress the Law and become slaves to sin and death. This problem is only exacerbated by Satan who exploits this weakness and tempts us. Thus, simply being aware of sin doesn't save us, nor does trying to follow the Law by our own might. We need a Savior.

"So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members" (Rom. 7:21-23).

The good news is that when we put our faith in Christ, we are given the Holy Spirit, to help us fight against this "law of sin" by constantly pointing us to God's truth. And when we are born again, accepting Christ's death as our own death to the "law of sin", we are born of the Spirit. Through Christ we finally begin to fulfill the Law joyously and progressively as we walk in him.
