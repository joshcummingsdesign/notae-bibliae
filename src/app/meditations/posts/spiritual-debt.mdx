When someone really wrongs you, it doesn't matter if you say you forgive them, there still exists a sort of debt between you and the other person, a spiritual debt if you will, and the reality is that the debt must be paid. It will either be paid by you or the other person. For example, you will pay with anger, frustration, sadness, etc., or they will pay with reconciliation. If you and I sense this, how much more would God sense this? It can be plainly stated that the Old Testament ends with a massive amount of spiritual debt accrued, and not just toward each other, but toward God himself.

There is a third way to pay the debt, however, that our radical individualism can blind us to, which is that another can pay the debt in solidarity with us. For example, in ancient times, one's value was in their family, and primarily in the firstborn or only son because he was the one who was to claim the inheritance and take care of the family. Thus, it was understood that the only son could pay the sin debt on behalf of his family. If someone in the family failed, the only son could stand up and make reconciliation on their behalf.

In the tabernacle, we see the payment of spiritual debt play out in the ritual offerings. The tabernacle offerings weren't just a way to demonstrate confession, repentance, and the giving of your whole self in the service of God, they actually fed the priests in order to make reconciliation for wrongdoing.

So, how is it that Jesus paid our spiritual debt? Jesus not only bore the sufferings our collective sin created by dying on the cross, he gave himself fully and beyond measure in the service of God on our behalf. Further, he turned our collective sin into the ultimate good. Through his resurrection, he demonstrated the power of sin had no hold on him, and gave us hope in everlasting life. What's more, he gave us his presence in the Holy Spirit which empowers us each day as we take up our cross and follow him in this life unto the age to come.
