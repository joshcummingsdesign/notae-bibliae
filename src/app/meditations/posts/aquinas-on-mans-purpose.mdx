Man's desire, properly speaking, moves him toward his final cause ([ST I-II, q. 1, a. 6, co.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q1.A6.C)).

When man's final cause is realized, he has no more desires ([ST I-II, q. 1, a. 5, co., par. 1](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q1.A5.C)).

When he has no more desires, he has perfect happiness ([ST I-II, q. 1, a. 7, s.c.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q1.A7.SC)).

But, man is not perfectly happy so long as something remains for him to desire; and when man knows an effect, there remains in him the desire to know the cause ([ST I-II, q. 3, a. 8, co., par. 1](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q3.A8.C)).

Consequently, for perfect happiness the intellect needs to reach the very Essence of the First Cause. Thus, the intellect will have its perfection through union with God, in whom alone rests man's perfect happiness ([ST I-II, q. 3, a. 8, co., par. 2](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q3.A8.C.2)).

Thus, man's final cause is union with God.
