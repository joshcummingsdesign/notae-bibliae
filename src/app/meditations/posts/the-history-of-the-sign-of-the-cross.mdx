The Sign of the Cross is a blessing or prayer made with the body; it is a proclamation of the Trinity and the two natures of Christ; it is an acknowledgement of Christ's life, death, and resurrection; and it aids us in spiritual warfare. But how is it done, and how did it come to be?

The use of the Sign of the Cross traces back to as early as the 3rd century. [Tertullian](/people/scholars/tertullian) spoke of in it in his treatise *De Corona* (Latin: "On the Crown") in around 201 AD.

> "At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the Sign."

Early Christians traced a little cross on their foreheads. They associated the practice with references in Ezek. 9:4, Rev. 7:3, Rev. 9:4, and Rev. 14:1—all of which describe believers bearing God's seal on their foreheads. The 3rd-century treatise *Apostolic Tradition*, attributed to [St. Hippolytus](/people/saints/early/hippolytus-of-rome), directs that the Sign be used during Baptism, before praying at fixed prayer times, and in times of temptation.[^1]

In the 4th Century, [St. Cyril of Jerusalem](/people/saints/greek-fathers/cyril-of-jerusalem) spoke of the Sign of the Cross in his catechetical lectures.

> "Let us not then be ashamed to confess the Crucified. Be the Cross our seal made with boldness by our fingers on our brow, and on everything; over the bread we eat, and the cups we drink; in our comings in, and goings out; before our sleep, when we lie down and when we rise up; when we are in the way, and when we are still. Great is that preservative; it is without price, for the sake of the poor; without toil, for the sick; since also its grace is from God. It is the Sign of the faithful, and the dread of devils: for he triumphed over them in it, having made a show of them openly (Col. 2:15); for when they see the Cross they are reminded of the Crucified; they are afraid of him, who bruised the heads of the dragon. Despise not the Seal, because of the freeness of the gift; out for this the rather honor your Benefactor."

[St. Basil the Great](/people/saints/cappadocian-fathers/basil-the-great) spoke of the Sign of the Cross as an apostolic teaching.

> "Concerning the teachings of the Church, whether publicly proclaimed or reserved to members of the household of faith, we have received some from written sources, while others have been given to us secretly, through apostolic tradition…that we should sign with the Sign of the Cross those who, trusting in the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, are to be enrolled as catechumens…"

The Sign of the Cross has also been used in acts of Christian civil disobedience, such as during the Diocletian Persecutions.

> "Diocletian, as being of a timorous disposition, was a searcher into futurity, and during his abode in the East he began to slay victims, that from their livers he might obtain a prognostic of events; and while he sacrificed, some attendants of his, who were Christians, stood by, and they put the immortal Sign on their foreheads. At this the demons were chased away, and the holy rites interrupted.
>
> <cite>[Lactantius, *Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died*, ch. 10](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0705.htm)</cite>

It is unclear exactly when the shift was made from signing on the forehead to making the larger sign that we know today, but it is likely that the battle against heresy and continued acts of Christian civil disobedience led to its development. To combat Arianism (the belief that Christ was not truly divine, but a created being) and monophysitism (the belief that Christ had only one divine nature instead of two natures, one human and one divine), Christians in the East began to sign themselves with three fingers to represent the Holy Trinity and two fingers to represent the two natures of Christ. This can be seen in early Byzantine iconography such as in the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="khristos-pantokrator" text="Christ Pantocrator" /> of Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dating from the 6th century. In this icon, Christ is depicted with his thumb and last two fingers touching together, his first two fingers extended, and his middle finger is slightly bent; the extended index finger representing his divinity and the bent middle finger representing his humanity.

In the 8th century, we get a clear teaching of the large right cross—singing top to bottom and right to left—from Pope Leo IV. Leo decreed that the first three fingers be used to sign the chalice and the host in the Eucharist, maintaining the pattern of three and two.

> "Sign the chalice and the host with a right cross and not with circles or with a varying of the fingers, but with two fingers stretched out and the thumb hidden within them, by which the Trinity is symbolized. Take heed to make this Sign rightly, for otherwise you can bless nothing."
>
> <cite>[Pope St. Leo the GreatV, *Catholic Encyclopedia*, vol. 13, p. 2017](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/h/herbermann/cathen13/cache/cathen13.pdf)</cite>

Over time, Christians in the East began pinching their first three fingers together to underscore that the three persons of the Trinity are also one in being, and folding the ring and little finger down to represent the two natures of Christ. This practice can be seen in the Eastern Church to this day.

Further clarifications were made regarding the meaning of the Sign of the Cross in the 12th-century work *A Treasury of Divine Knowledge* by St. Peter of Damascus.

> "Then we should also marvel how demons and various diseases are dispelled by the Sign of the precious and life-giving cross, which all can make without cost or effort. Who can number the panegyrics composed in its honor? The holy Fathers have handed down to us the inner significance of this sign, so that we can refute heretics and unbelievers. The two fingers and single hand with which it is made represent the Lord Jesus Christ crucified, and he is thereby acknowledged to exist in two-natures and one hypostasis or person. The use of the right hand betokens his infinite power and the fact that he sits at the right hand of the Father. That the Sign begins with a downward movement from above signifies his descent to us from heaven. Again, the movement of the hand from the right side to the left drives away our enemies and declares that by his invincible power the Lord overcame the devil, who is on the left side, dark and lacking strength."

Here it is inferred that because Christ is at the right hand of the Father in light, evil sits in darkness to the left (Matt. 25:31-34). Interestingly, the English word "sinister" comes from the Latin for "left hand".

As time went on, Christians in the West began to sign themselves with a left cross, that is, top to bottom and left to right. One explanation for this development is that congregants began to mirror the priest when he blessed them with a right cross.[^2]

By the late Middle Ages, the left cross had become the standard practice in the West. A clear example of this teaching can be found in the 15th-century treatise *Myroure of Our Ladye* (Middle English: "Mirror of Our Lady"), written for the Bridgettine Sisters of Syon Abbey in the town of Isleworth in West London, England—a monastic order which follows the [*Rule of Saint Augustine*](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo), founded by Bridget of Sweden (1303 – 1373).

> "Make the Sign of the Holy Cross to drive away the devil and all his deceits. For, as [[St. John Chrysostom](/people/saints/greek-fathers/john-chrysostom)] says: Wherever the devils see the Sign of the Cross, they flee, fearing it as a staff that beats them. In making this Sign of the Cross, you begin with your hand at your head, then move downward, next to the left side, and finally to the right side. This is a sign and a belief that our Lord Jesus Christ came down from the Head—that is, from the Father—to earth through his holy Incarnation. From the earth, he went to the left side—that is, to hell—through his bitter Passion, and from there to his Father's right side through his glorious Ascension. After this, you bring your hand to your chest as a sign that you have come to thank him and praise him with all the love in your heart for these blessings."

During the Reformation, the practice of the Sign of the Cross was further codified. Martin Luther's *Small Catechism*, written in 1529, assigns it to morning and evening prayer.

> "Bless yourself with the Holy Cross and say: In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen."
>
> <cite>[SC 7:1](https://bookofconcord.org/small-catechism/daily-prayers/)</cite>

It is evident that by Luther's time, the [Trinitarian Formula](/liturgy/prayers/sign-of-the-cross#trinitarian-formula) was associated not only with Baptism, but with making the Sign of the Cross. The Church of England's Confirmation rites, outlined in the 1549 edition of the *Book of Common Prayer*, reflect this same pattern.

> "I sign thee with the Sign of the Cross, and lay my hand upon thee. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."
>
> <cite>[BCP 1549, p. 76](http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1549/BCP1549.pdf)</cite>

The 1570 *Roman Missal* outlined how the priest is to make the Sign of the Cross and recite the Trinitarian Formula at the foot of the altar at the beginning of the Mass.

> "Standing and honoring before the lowest step of the altar…[the priest] makes the Sign of the Cross with his right hand, moving from his forehead to his chest. He says in a clear voice: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."
>
> <cite>[MR 1570, p. 62, par. 4](https://media.churchmusicassociation.org/pdf/romanmissal_classical.pdf)</cite>

Later traditions emerged based on local customs. Some make the Sign of the Cross with all five fingers extended for the five wounds of Christ. Some make a small cross with their index finger and thumb and kiss the cross at the end. Some bring their hands together in prayer at the end for the Amen. You may even see Eastern bishops making the Christogram (ICXC, the Greek letters that stand for Jesus Christ) with their fingers when blessing others.

The Sign of the Cross is deeply rooted in the history and tradition of the Church. It is rich with symbolism and meaning, and helps to aid us in spiritual warfare. While there are many variations, one thing remains clear, it is a symbol of Christ and our faith, and should be done with the utmost reverence.
