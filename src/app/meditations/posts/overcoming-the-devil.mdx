The Bible tells us there are three weapons we have to overcome the devil. What are they, you ask? Let's start our study in the Book of Revelation and see what Scripture tells us.

## The Woman and the Child

In John's vision, he sees in heaven a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars (Rev. 12:1). According to St. Victorinus (4th-century Bishop of Pettau in modern northeast Slovenia), the woman represents Israel, from whom the Messiah was to come. The woman is pregnant and is crying out in birth pains (Rev. 12:2), which represents the suffering of the saints as Israel awaits its Redeemer (Gen. 3:14-15).

> "The woman clothed with the sun, and having the moon under her feet, and wearing a crown of twelve stars upon her head, and travailing in her pains, is the ancient Church of fathers, and prophets, and saints, and apostles, which had the groans and torments of its longing until it saw that Christ, the fruit of its people according to the flesh long promised to it, had taken flesh out of the selfsame people. Moreover, being clothed with the sun intimates the hope of resurrection and the glory of the promise. And the moon intimates the fall of the bodies of the saints under the obligation of death, which never can fail. For even as life is diminished, so also it is increased. Nor is the hope of those that sleep extinguished absolutely, as some think, but they have in their darkness a light such as the moon. And the crown of twelve stars signifies the choir of fathers, according to the fleshly birth, of whom Christ was to take flesh."

John then sees in heaven Satan depicted as a red dragon with seven heads standing before the woman waiting to devour the child (Rev. 12:3-4). "What is Satan doing in heaven?" you might ask. <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="satan" text="Satan" /> is Hebrew for "the Accuser", and we see him throughout Scripture in God's heavenly throne room (Job 1:6-11) (Zech. 3:1-2), where we see God as Judge (Dan. 7:9-10).

As everyone is anticipating the birth of the child—Israel for redemption, and the devil for destruction—the child is unexpectedly caught up into heaven before the throne of God (Rev. 12:5). This represents the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus ([Victorinus on Revelation 12:5](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0712.htm)) (Dan. 7:13-14) (Acts 1:6-11).

## Jesus in the Heavenly Courtroom

The author of Hebrews tells us that as Satan was accusing the faithful before God's throne day and night, Jesus arrived in heaven to bring a certain piece of evidence into God's heavenly courtroom. What was that evidence? Thankfully, it was not our works. It was Christ's blood shed for the remission of sin, which is the evidence for our acquittal (Heb. 9:11-14). Further, we are told that Jesus arrived in heaven to stand before God's throne as our High Priest and Intercessor (Heb. 4:14-16) (John 2:1-2). Therefore, not only is every accusation Satan brings before God covered by Jesus' atoning work on the cross, and therefore not admissible in the heavenly courtroom, but every sin that Satan would mention would be a denial of Christ's once-for-all sacrifice (Rom. 8:1-4) (Col. 2:13-15).

## Satan Cast Down From Heaven

In John's vision, he sees the woman flee into the wilderness to a place prepared by God where she is to be nourished for a time (Rev. 12:6). This harkens back to God delivering Israel from slavery in Egypt, leading them out into the wilderness, and nourishing them with manna (Neh. 9:19-21), and points to the fact that Christ has offered us an even greater deliverance than this (John 6:31-33). John then sees Michael the archangel called in to battle Satan and cast him out of heaven (Rev. 12:7-9). Thus, Satan can no longer stand before God accusing the faithful in the heavenly courtroom.

John then hears a loud voice in heaven saying, "Rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!" (Rev. 12:12). Because the devil can no longer accuse us before God the Father, he accuses us in the courtroom of our own heart. He does so by either minimizing our sins—that we continue on in our tresspasses harming ourselves and others—or maximizing our sins—that we fall into despair.

## What Overcomes the Devil

Though Satan accuses us in the courtroom of our heart, the Bible tells us that we can not only resist the him, but in fact overcome him. How, you ask? John is told the answer in his vision.

> **"And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, 'Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.'"**
>
> <cite>Revelation 12:10-11</cite>

Therefore, that which overcomes the devil is threefold: **the blood**, **the word**, and **not fearing death**.

The blood, which is evidence for our acquittal, is also brought down to us in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, about which Luther had this to say:

> "The [Lord's Supper] is nothing but the aforesaid words of Christ: 'Take and eat, etc.' (Matt. 26:26), as if he were saying: 'Behold, O sinful and condemned man, out of the pure and unmerited love with which I love you, and by the will of the Father of mercies (2 Cor. 1:3), apart from any merit or desire of yours, I promise you in these words the forgiveness of all your sins and life everlasting. And that you may be absolutely certain of this irrevocable promise of mine, I shall give my body and pour out my blood, confirming this promise by my very death, and leaving you my body and blood as a sign and memorial of this same promise. As often as you partake of them, remember me, proclaim and praise my love and bounty toward you, and give thanks.'"

The word is a gift from God by which we can overcome the devil as Jesus did (Matt. 4:1-4). In fact, the word is one of the principal forms of grace we experience in the Church. *The Augsburg Confession,* for example, defines the Church as "the congregation of saints, in which the gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments are rightly administered" ([AC 7:1](https://bookofconcord.org/augsburg-confession/of-the-church/)).

Finally, the author of Hebrews tells us that fearing death makes us slaves to Satan's accusations, and that when we are freed from the fear of death through faith in Christ, we are set free from the devil (Heb. 2:14-15). Paul tells us "to live is Christ, and to die is gain" (Phil. 1:21-26), and that in Christ, death has no hold on us (1 Cor. 15:55-57). Christ freed us from the fear of death, and in that freedom the devil is overcome.
