A child doesn't earn the love of his father. The father loves him completely and fully, and in an outpouring of that love, the child grows to more closely resemble his father. In the same way, we are not saved by our own might, but by the grace of God, our Father in heaven, who loves us and forgave us. In an outpouring of his love, our works become truly good, because we act out of our love for God and others, not to earn God's favor. Works proceed from faith. And through faith, God gives us the heart to joyfully act in accordance with his will.
