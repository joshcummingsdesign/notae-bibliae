## Johannes Gutenberg

In the mid 15th century, German inventor and craftsman Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press. In 1455, he printed the Vulgate in three volumes with two columns per page and 42 lines per column. It was set in blackletter typeface and printed on vellum. Each initial (large ornamental letter at the beginning of a section) was hand painted in color.[^1] The original number of copies of the Gutenberg Bible is unknown, but there are still around 40 copies in existence.[^2]

## Erasmus

Erasmus was a Dutch theologian who was ordained a Catholic priest in 1492. In contrast to scholasticism, which favored Aristotelean philosophy, Erasmus promoted humanism, which emphasized the study of Classical and biblical texts in relation to civic virtue. Erasmus helped lay the groundwork for the historical-critical study of the past, especially in his studies of the Greek New Testament and the Church Fathers. In 1516, Erasmus compiled and published a scholarly edition of the New Testament in the original Greek. It was based on a limited number of Greek manuscripts that Erasmus had access to at the time, along with some back-translations from the Latin when parts of the Greek text were missing. Despite these limitations, it became the standard Greek text used across much of Europe for centuries, and formed the basis of what became known as the Textus Receptus (Latin: "Received Text").[^3] Concerned with ecclesiastical abuses in the Roman Catholic Church, Erasmus sought reform from within through a renewal of biblical theology.[^4]

## Martin Luther

The <Definition lang="latin" anchor="reverendus" text="Reverend" /> Dr. Martin Luther was born on November 11, 1483 in Eisleben, Saxony (northeastern Germany) on the feast of St. Martin of Tours, after whom he was named. When Luther was young, his family moved to Mansfeld, where his father worked in the copper mines. Luther studied at the University of Erfurt, where he was exposed to theology and philosophy. His father wanted him to be a lawyer.

In the summer of 1505, Luther was nearly struck by lightning and was thrown from his horse. He called out to St. Anne—patron saint of miners—for help, and when he arose unhurt, he vowed to become a monk.[^5] Soon after, Luther became an Augustinian friar. As a friar, Luther did everything he could to win God's favor.[^6] He would spend countless hours in confession, and later said, "I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter, and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul."[^7]

In 1507, Luther was ordained a priest, and vowed to teach the word of God faithfully. In 1508, he began teaching at the University of Wittenberg, and earned a Doctor of Theology in 1512.[^8] During his tenure at Wittenberg, Luther went on a pilgrimage to Rome with some of his fellow friars. There, he witnessed firsthand what he believed to be the pride of overreaching papal authority.[^9]

In 1517, Luther wrote the Ninety-five Theses, a list of 95 propositions for an academic disputation of the Roman Catholic doctrines of penance and indulgences, and on October 31, he nailed it to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. It was printed and began to circulate around Germany.[^10]

In 1518, while teaching through the Book of Romans, Luther began to reflect deeply on the words of St. Paul, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, 'The righteous shall live by faith'" (Rom. 1:16-17). It was then that God's saving grace through the gospel landed on Luther's heart. Luther later described this experience, saying, "It was as if the very gates of heaven had opened before me."[^11] The doctrine that one is saved by grace alone through faith alone is called "justification by faith", and it is this doctrine that Luther began to share with others.

## The First Diet of Augsburg

In the summer of 1518, Martin Luther was summoned to Rome to defend his teachings, but Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, who sympathized with Luther, secured a hearing in Augsburg (southeastern Germany) instead. At the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="dieta" text="First Diet of Augsburg" />, Italian Cardinal Bishop Thomas Cajetan debated Luther on the issues of indulgences and justification by faith. At the end of the debate, Cajetan advised Luther that further conversations were useless unless he was willing to recant. Luther immediately fled Augsburg and returned to Wittenberg, where he issued an appeal for a general council of the Church to hear his case.[^12]

## The Leipzig Debate

After fleeing Augsburg, Martin Luther sought to avoid public debates. However, in 1519, he was drawn into an academic debate with German Catholic priest and theologian Johann Eck.

During the debate, Eck used the term "Lutheran" in a derogatory manner to refer to Luther's theology. Luther disliked the term, preferring <Definition lang="greek" anchor="euangelion" text='"evangelical"' /> instead.[^13] Eck compared Luther's resistance to the papacy to that of Jan Hus, to which Luther responded, "Among the articles of faith held by Jan Hus and the Bohemians, there are some that are most Christian. This is a positive certainty. Here, for instance, is one: 'That there is but one universal church;' and here is another: 'It is not necessary for salvation to believe the Roman Church superior to all others.' It is of little consequence to me whether these things were said by Wycliffe or by Hus…they are truth." This shocked those in attendance.

Eck continued to defend the papacy, saying that the Eastern Church had shipwrecked their faith by abandoning the pope, to which Luther responded, "What! Are not Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil the Great, Epiphanius, Chrysostom, and an immense number besides of Greek bishops—are they not saved? And yet they did not believe that the Church of Rome was above the other churches!…It is not in the power of the Roman pontiffs to make new articles of faith. The Christian believer acknowledges no other authority than Holy Scripture. This alone is the right divine. I beg the worthy doctor to concede that the Roman pontiffs were men, and that he will not make them gods."[^14]

Needless to say, the debate only accelerated the controversy in which Luther found himself.

## The Diet of Worms

In 1520, Martin Luther wrote three key Reformation writings: *An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility*, *The Babylonian Captivity of the Church*, and *A Treatise on Christian Liberty*.

In *An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility*, Luther pointed out that Rome had built "three walls" around themselves: 1. When pressed by the temporal power, they made decrees that the temporal power had no jurisdiction over them; 2. When pressed by argumentation from the Scriptures, they raised the objection that the interpretation of the Scriptures belonged to the pope alone; and 3. When pressed by church councils, they answered that no one could call a church council but the pope.[^15]

In *The Babylonian Captivity of the Church*, Luther defined a sacrament as that which was instituted by Christ, includes a visible element, and has a promise of grace attached to it. Thus, he saw Baptism and the Lord's Supper as valid sacraments. Although he held to the doctrine of Real Presence, he was against making the Aristotelean philosophy of transubstantiation a binding doctrine, and felt it muddied the clarity, simplicity, and purpose of the Lord's Supper, namely faith and the forgiveness of sins. He was also concerned that the laity were being deprived of Communion in both kinds.[^16]

In *A Treatise on Christian Liberty*, Luther posited that "a Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none," and at the same time "a Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all." Drawing from St. Paul, he distinguished between the Law and the gospel, stating that the purpose of the Law is to awaken the knowledge of one's sins, and so be converted to repentance and a better life. He also argued that while tradition builds us up in the faith, it is not a means of justification.[^17]

Later that year, Pope Leo X issued a papal bull condemning Luther's writings and giving him 60 days to recant.[^18] Luther refused to recant, and in 1521, he was ordered by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to appear before the Diet of Worms (southwest Germany). At the diet, Luther was asked to recant, to which he responded, "Unless I am convinced by testimonies of the Scriptures or by clear arguments that I am in error—for popes and councils have often erred and contradicted themselves—I cannot withdraw, for I am subject to the Scriptures I have quoted; my conscience is captive to the Word of God. It is unsafe and dangerous to do anything against one's conscience. Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise. God help me! Amen!"[^19]

At the end of the diet, Charles V issued the Edict of Worms, a decree which condemned Luther as a "notorious heretic" and banned citizens from propagating his ideas.[^20] Fearing for Luther's safety, Frederick III hid Luther at his castle in Wartburg.[^21]

## The Luther Bible

While hiding at Wartburg Castle, Luther used the Textus Receptus to translate the Greek New Testament into German. In 1522, Luther returned to Wittenberg where his fellow reformers, such as Philip Melanchthon, aided him in revising his translation. Soon after the Luther Bible was printed.[^22]

By 1524, Luther and his colleagues had finished translating the entire Bible.[^23] That same year, Erasmus wrote *The Freedom of the Will*, which asserted that humans cooperate with God's grace in the process of salvation (also known as synergism). In response, Luther wrote *The Bondage of the Will* which asserted that God alone is the instrument of salvation, and that the human will plays no part (also known as monergism).[^24]

## Ulrich Zwingli

Ulrich Zwingli was a 16th-century Swiss Catholic priest. In 1519, he began preaching through the entire Book of Matthew rather than following the church's traditional lectionary schedule. He then began preaching through other books of the Bible according to the needs of the congregation.[^25]

During the season of Lent in 1522, Zwingli was at the house of a local printer named Christoph Froschauer, when Froschauer publicly served his dozen workers sausage. Froschauer was arrested for breaking the Lenten fast, and Zwingli protested in a sermon called "On the Choice and Freedom of Foods". In his sermon, Zwingli argued that fasting is a personal commitment to God, not a biblical ordinance.[^26] This underscored Zwingli's high view of Scripture over the traditions of the church. Zwingli's teachings created conflict with Bishop of Constance Hugo von Hohenlandenberg.[^27]

Due to the rising tensions between the Swiss Reformers and their Roman Catholic opponents, a city council was called in Zürich (northeast Switzerland) in 1523. Zwingli stood before the council to defend his Sixty-seven Articles, in which he asserted that salvation is through Christ alone, that Christ is the only true High Priest and Mediator, and that the Bible is the ultimate authority on all matters of faith. He rejected the sacrifice of the Mass, mandatory priestly celibacy, and mandatory fasting. The city of Zürich ultimately accepted Zwingli's ideas, which greatly aided the cause of the Swiss Reformation.[^28]

## The Anabaptists

In 1525, Felix Manz, Conrad Grebel, George Blaurock, and other radical evangelicals separated from Ulrich Zwingli and established a group called the Swiss Brethren. One of their distinguishing beliefs was the rejection of the Catholic practice of infant baptism (also known as pedobaptism). They argued that Baptism is valid only when one freely confesses their faith and requests to be baptized (also known as credobaptism).[^29] Their opponents called them <Definition lang="greek" anchor="anabaptismos" text='"Anabaptists"' />, as they desired to re-baptize those who had been baptized as infants.[^30]

The Anabaptists refused military service, denounced tithes, and challenged both civil and ecclesiastical authority, and over time the Zürich government began to see them as dangerous and subversive. Zwingli, who upheld the traditional practice of infant baptism, began to publicly debate the Anabaptists. The Zürich government ultimately sided with Zwingli, and in 1525, the city council issued a mandate that anyone refusing to have their children baptized must leave the city. A year later, re-baptism was banned under penalty of drowning. Felix Manz continued to preach and baptize, and in 1527, he was arrested and drowned.[^31]

## The Protestation at Speyer

As the Reformation progressed, the Edict of Worms became increasingly difficult to enforce. Attempts to uphold it at the First Diet of Nuremberg in 1522, the Second Diet of Nuremberg in 1524, and the First Diet of Speyer in 1526 were largely unsuccessful.[^32] The Second Diet of Speyer in 1529, however, ruled that the Edict of Worms was not only to be enforced, but that all future reformation efforts were to be banned. This prompted the Protestation at Speyer, in which 14 free cities and six princes petitioned against the imperial ban of the evangelical faith. Those who supported the petition became known to their opponents as "Protestants".[^33]

## The Marburg Colloquy

Following the Protestation at Speyer, Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse (central Germany)—anticipating opposition from the Roman Catholic Church—sought to mend the growing divisions among Protestants, particularly with regards to the theology of the Eucharist. In 1529, he held a debate at Marburg Castle in Hesse which became known as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="colloquium" text="Marburg Colloquy" />. Among the participants were Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli. Although the two agreed on many points, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of Real Presence. Zwingli argued that although Christ is indeed present in the Eucharist, his presence is not contained within the bread and the wine. In Zwingli's view, the bread and the wine serve as symbols of Christ's body and blood, which call to one's mind the eternal redemption that God places before us to receive by faith.[^34] At the end of the debate, Philip requested that Luther draw up 15 articles of the Protestant faith. The 15th article stated that a consensus could not be reached on the doctrine of Real Presence.[^35]

## The Lutheran Church

Having been excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, Martin Luther and his fellow reformers were now faced with an important question: could the ordained presbyters among them perform valid ordinations, or were ordinations only valid when performed by a bishop? The Lutheran theologians came to the conclusion with historical evidence that the office of bishop—as distinct from the presbyters—developed out of human delegation rather than divine ordinance, and that it was not without precedent for the presbyters among them to ordain their own bishop, so long as he was regularly called, i.e. called to the ministry through the church body and not by claims of an extraordinary call by God directly.[^36][^37][^38] Additionally, Luther affirmed the doctrine of "the priesthood of all believers", in which ordination does not confer an indelible character that makes presbyters essentially different from the laity, but rather the presbyters and the laity differ only in office.[^39] Because of this, Lutherans use the term <Definition lang="latin" anchor="pastor" text='"pastor"' /> instead of "priest", and the term "superintendent" instead of "bishop".

In 1529, Luther, surprised by the lack of biblical knowledge he experienced while visiting many congregations around Saxony, wrote *The Small Catechism* and *The Large Catechism* to outline the basic teachings of the Christian faith.[^40][^41]

## The Augsburg Confession

As Lutheranism began to spread throughout northern Europe, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V realized he had a divided kingdom. In 1529, the Turks besieged Vienna, and Charles called on the princes and free territories in Germany to explain their religious convictions in an attempt to restore religious and political unity in the Holy Roman Empire, and rally support against the Turks. In 1530, the Second Diet of Augsburg was held, and a Lutheran confession written primarily by Philip Melanchthon in both German and Latin was presented to Charles. This is known as *The Augsburg Confession*.[^42]

The Lutherans felt that the need of the hour was conciliation, and therefore agreed that Luther should be protected at Coburg Fortress during the Diet. Luther, however, continued to write and support his fellow reformers in Augsburg. To an anxious Melanchthon he wrote, "I vehemently hate the miserable anxieties with which you write you are consumed. That they reign in your heart is due not to the magnitude of the affair, but to the magnitude of our unbelief. For this same affair was greater in the time of Jan Hus and of many others than in our time. And though it were great, for it is not our cause. Why, then, do you thus torment yourself perpetually and without respite? If the cause be false, let us revoke it. But if it be true, why do we make him a liar who gives us such promises and commands us to be of a quiet and restful heart?"[^43]

In response to *The Augsburg Confession*, the Roman Catholic Church issued a refutation which was met with Charles' approval. Melanchthon responded with the *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="apologia" text="Apology of the Augsburg Confession" />*, but Charles refused to accept it when presented to him, and demanded that the reformers return to the Catholic Church.[^44] This contributed to the formation of the Schmalkaldic League, a defensive alliance formed in 1531 in Schmalkalden (central Germany) by Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse and John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony.[^45]

## The Münster Rebellion

In around 1530, German Anabaptist leader Melchior Hoffman began to propagate the idea that Christ's second coming would occur in 1533, and that he would ride into Strasbourg (northeastern France) with Christ in the clouds to establish the New Jerusalem.[^46] Hoffman was imprisoned, and was succeeded by the Dutch Anabaptist leader Jan Matthys who, contrary to Anabaptist teachings on pacifism, took up the sword and seized the city of Münster (northwestern Germany) in 1534. Münster was quickly surrounded by troops, and Matthys was killed. Matthys was then succeeded by Dutch Anabaptist leader John of Leiden who proclaimed himself to be a Davidic king and took for himself sixteen wives.[^47] The town was captured by an army of Catholics and Lutherans, and John of Leiden and his followers were executed.[^48] After the suppression of the rebellion, religious and secular authorities enacted harsh measures against anyone claiming to be an Anabaptist.[^49]

## William Tyndale

William Tyndale was a 16th-century English Bible scholar who was educated at the University of Oxford and became a professor at the University of Cambridge. Influenced by humanism, Tyndale became firmly convinced of the primacy of Scripture, and argued that all believers should have access to the Bible in their own language. In 1523, Tyndale used the Textus Receptus to begin work on translating the Greek New Testament into English.[^50]

In 1524, Tyndale left for Cologne, Germany after church authorities in England prevented him from translating the Bible. While in Cologne, he received financial support from wealthy London merchants to continue his work, and in 1525, he completed and published the first edition of his New Testament translation. Soon after, however, his work was interrupted by the magistrates of the city, so Tyndale left for Worms, where he published two more editions. The first copies of the Tyndale Bible were smuggled into England in 1526.

After finishing his New Testament translation, Tyndale began working on translating the Hebrew Old Testament into English. His translation of the Pentateuch was published as five separate books in Marburg in 1530. Tyndale continued work on translating the Old Testament, but was captured by the Inquisition in Antwerp (in modern Belgium) before it was completed.

Tyndale was imprisoned for a year and a half and tried for heresy. The focus of his trial was his affirmation of the doctrine of justification by faith.[^51] In 1536, Tyndale was found guilty, and was strangled to death and burned at the stake.[^52] His last words were "Lord! Open the King of England's eyes."[^53]

## Menno Simons

Menno Simons was a 16th-century Dutch Catholic priest. Even as a priest, Menno had never read the Bible, but after beginning to question the doctrines of Real Presence and infant baptism, he felt a calling to read it for the first time in his life. Soon after, he affirmed the primacy of Scripture.

As a result of his studies, Menno came to adopt credobaptism, however, he vehemently opposed the violent Anabaptists of Münster. In 1536, he left the Roman Catholic Church, was re-baptized, and joined a peaceful Dutch Anabaptist group led by a man named Obbe Philips. A year later, Philips ordained Menno as an elder.

Menno was deemed a heretic by the Roman Catholic Church, and in 1542, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V issued an edict against him, promising a reward for his arrest.[^54] One of Menno's major departures from orthodoxy was his monophysite Christology.[^55] Nevertheless, he went on to be a very influential Anabaptist leader. His followers came to be called the Mennonites. Like all Anabaptists, Mennonites went on to be heavily persecuted.[^56]

## John Calvin

John Calvin was born in 1509 in Noyon, a town in northern France. In 1523, his father sent him to the University of Paris to be educated for the priesthood, but Calvin later decided to study law at the University of Orléans and the University of Bourges. He then returned to Paris, where he became interested in humanist writers such as Erasmus, which inspired him to study Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.

In 1533, Nicolas Cop, <Definition lang="latin" anchor="rector" text="rector" /> of the University of Paris, made a public statement calling for reform in the Roman Catholic Church. The statement, which Calvin was said to have influenced, provoked a scandal, and Cop was forced to flee to Basel in northern Switzerland. Calvin left Paris, and eventually made his way to Basel as well.

In Basel, Calvin studied theology intensively, and began to write the first edition of his masterwork *The Institutes of the Christian Religion*, which he finished and published in 1536. Later that year, fellow reformer William Farel persuaded Calvin to aid reformation efforts in Geneva (southwest Switzerland). Calvin agreed, and the two made significant progress, but were ultimately expelled in 1538. Calvin spent three years in Strasbourg, but returned to Geneva in 1541, where his reforms were finally accepted.

Calvin advocated for four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and administer the Sacraments, teachers to provide theological education and instruction, elders to provide discipline, and deacons to care for the poor and the needy.[^57] Calvin's view of church polity laid the foundation for what we call "Presbyterianism" today.[^58]

Like Luther, Calvin accepted Baptism and the Lord's Supper as valid sacraments.[^59] Calvin, however, described Real Presence as a spiritual presence, and asserted that Christ's body remains locally present in heaven, and need not descend in order for believers to truly partake of it because the Holy Spirit effects communion.[^60] Unlike Luther, who saw Baptism as the ordinary means by which God imparts to the faithful his grace, forgiveness, and new life, Calvin saw faith through God's unmerited election as the instrument of salvation, and Baptism—though a powerful and efficacious sign—as a seal of God's covenant promises.[^61][^62][^63]

Calvin's soteriology was later summarized in what came to be called The Five Points of Calvinism (TULIP – Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace, and Preservation of the Saints).[^64] Over time, the term "Reformed" became synonymous with Calvinism.[^65]

## The Church of England

At the beginning of the Reformation, England remained Roman Catholic under the reign of King Henry VIII. In 1521, Henry published *Defense of the Seven Sacraments* in response to Lutheran challenges to Catholic teaching. For his work, Henry was given the title "Defender of the Faith" (Latin: *Fidei Defensor*) by Pope Leo X.

Henry was married to his late brother Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon, the aunt of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.[^66] Henry and Catherine struggled to have children, and had only one daughter named Mary. The inability to secure a male heir posed a serious threat to the Tudor dynasty. This prompted Henry to ask Pope Clement VII for an annulment of his marriage in 1527. When Clement denied the annulment, Henry used Parliament to assert royal authority over the English church.

Henry's religious beliefs remained aligned to traditional Catholicism throughout his reign, however, in order to secure royal supremacy over the church, he allied himself with Protestants, who until that time had been treated as heretics. Henry appointed the Rev. Dr. Thomas Cranmer as Archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas Cromwell as Vicegerent.

In 1533, Parliament passed the Act in Restraint of Appeals, barring legal cases from being appealed outside England. This allowed Henry to have his marriage annulled without reference to Rome. In November 1534, the Act of Supremacy formally abolished papal authority and declared Henry Supreme Head of the Church of England.[^67][^68]

Between 1536 and 1540, Henry VIII ordered the dissolution of monasteries, which owned much of the wealthiest land in England. He disbanded religious houses, appropriated their income, seized their assets, and provided pensions to the former residents.[^69]

## The Smalcald Articles

In 1536, Pope Paul III published a bull calling for a general council of the Roman Catholic Church to address the Reformation movement. In anticipation of the council, Martin Luther wrote a summary of doctrine known as the *Smalcald Articles*, which was to be presented at a meeting of the Schmalkaldic League. At this time, Melanchthon was asked to write a clear statement on the papacy, and wrote the *Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope*, which rejected the claims of the *Unam sanctam*. The Schmalkaldic League met in 1537, but Luther fell ill and could not attend. John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony presented the articles, but they were not unanimously accepted. Nonetheless, they went on to be widely read and held in high regard.[^70][^71]

## The Death of Martin Luther

In 1546, Martin Luther wrote to a friend that he felt "old, spent, worn, weary, and cold, and had but one eye to see with." Despite his condition, he left for Eisleben in order to help settle a land dispute. When he arrived, his illness worsened and he lay suffering in his hometown for several days. Finally, knowing he was at the end, Luther uttered his last words, "Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit." He died on February 18, 1546, and was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg.[^72][^73]

## The Book of Common Prayer

King Henry VIII's son, Edward VI, was greatly influenced by Protestant thinkers in his youth.[^74] When he became king in 1547, the Church of England underwent a theological reformation. In 1549, The *Book of Common Prayer* was introduced. Largely the work of Thomas Cranmer, it detailed the entire liturgy of the Church of England in the vernacular of the people. A revised edition was published in 1552, further embracing Protestant ideals, for example, replacing the term "Mass" with "The Lord's Supper" and "Holy Communion."[^75] In 1553, Cranmer drafted a set of doctrinal formulas known as the *Forty-Two Articles*, which, though not officially accepted by the church through a conciliar process, was enforced by royal mandate.[^76][^77]

## The Marian Persecutions

When King Edward VI died in 1553, his half-sister Mary I ascended to the throne, becoming the first Queen of England. During her reign, she vigorously attempted to reverse the English Reformation. She restored papal supremacy and persecuted hundreds of Protestants, including Thomas Cranmer.[^78]

## The Execution of Thomas Cranmer

In 1556, Thomas Cranmer was degraded and handed over to the secular authorities. He signed several recantations, but was ultimately charged with heresy. Cranmer was given the chance to make a final recantation at the University Church in Oxford. During his speech, he stated, "All such bills which I have written or signed with mine own hand since my degradation, wherein I have written many things untrue. And forasmuch as my hand offended in writing contrary to my heart, therefore my hand shall first be punished; for if I may come to the fire, it shall be first burned." He was then taken to be burned at the stake, where he put his right hand into the fire first. His last words were, "I see heaven open and Jesus on the right hand of God."[^79][^80]

## The Peace of Augsburg

After a great deal of political and military conflict between Catholic forces led by Charles V and the Schmalkaldic League, a treaty was reached in Augsburg in 1555 known as the Peace of Augsburg. The treaty allowed the state princes to select either Lutheranism or Catholicism as the religion of their domain, and permitted the free emigration of residents who dissented.[^81]

## The Thirty-Nine Articles

After Mary I's death in 1558, her younger half-sister Elizabeth I ascended to the throne. Elizabeth reversed Mary's attempt to reestablish Roman Catholicism in England. During her reign, the Rev. Dr. Matthew Parker was ordained as the Archbishop of Canterbury. Elizabeth sought a religious compromise that would end the tensions between Catholicism and Protestantism in England. The result was the Elizabethan Settlement, which sought to define the Church of England's position as the middle road (Latin: *via media*) between the extremes of Catholicism and Protestantism.[^82] Thomas Cranmer's *Forty-Two Articles* were revised under Parker's leadership, and in 1571, the resulting *Thirty-Nine Articles* were accepted as the doctrinal standard of the Church of England.[^83][^84]

## The Anglican Communion

Over time, <Definition lang="latin" anchor="anglicanus" text="Anglicanism" /> began to spread through British colonization, and many churches entered into communion with the Church of England while remaining independent and self-governing. This body of interconnected churches in relationship with the Church of England came to be known as the Anglican Communion. Though its roots trace back to the 16th century, the Anglican Communion held its first official conference at Lambeth Palace in London (the residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury) in 1867. Since then, the Lambeth Conference has convened every ten years.[^85]

## The Church of Scotland

John Knox was a Scottish Catholic priest who was influenced by the Scottish reformer George Wishart, becoming one of his closest associates. In March 1545, Cardinal David Beaton—Roman Catholic Archbishop of St Andrews, and staunch opponent of the Reformation in Scotland—ordered the arrest, trial, and execution of Wishart. Knox fled St Andrews to avoid persecution. Three months later, Beaton was assassinated by a group of Scottish Protestants who then seized St Andrews Castle. In 1547, Knox returned to St Andrews, and the group called him to be their minister. Knox reluctantly accepted. Soon after, French naval forces were called in, and the Protestant defenders, including John Knox, were captured and sent to France as galley slaves.

After Knox's release in 1549, he fled to England, where he became a preacher and advisor to Protestant leaders during the reign of King Edward VI. After Queen Mary I ascended to the throne, Knox fled to Geneva Switzerland in 1554 where he met John Calvin. After Queen Elizabeth I ascended to the throne, Knox returned to Scotland to support the embattled Protestant cause in 1559.

In 1560, Scottish Protestant forces supported by England defeated Catholic Queen Regent of Scotland Mary of Guise and her French allies, securing Protestant dominance in Scotland. Soon after, a confession of faith written primarily by Knox called the *Scots Confession* was presented to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament swiftly approved the Confession, abolished papal authority, and banned the Mass in Scotland. The newly-established Church of Scotland adopted a Presbyterian system of governance and replaced the episcopate with a structure led by ministers and elders.[^86][^87][^88]

## The Council of Trent

In 1545, Pope Paul III convened the Council of Trent (northern Italy), which sought to put an end to all reformation efforts within the Roman Catholic Church. The council was held in three parts, and lasted until 1563. The council addressed some of the abuses within the Catholic Church, such as the sale of indulgences and the misconduct of bishops, but held firm in its view of papal authority.

The Council of Trent ruled that the Roman Catholic Church is the ultimate interpreter of Scripture, with tradition holding equal authority. It confirmed the Latin Vulgate as the official biblical text over and against Protestant insistence on using biblical texts in the vernacular. It affirmed the deuterocanonical books as part of the Old Testament, fixed the number of sacraments at seven, and anathematized the doctrine of justification by faith.[^89]

The Council of Trent also led to the standardization of the Mass, which became known as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="tridentinus" text="Tridentine Mass" />. The Tridentine Mass would remain the standard in the Roman Catholic Church for the next 400 years.[^90]

## The Formula of Concord

After Martin Luther's death in 1546, Lutherans faced significant disputes over how to interpret and apply his teachings. Doctrinal controversies arose over issues such as as <Definition lang="greek" anchor="adiaphora" text="adiaphora" />, the role of good works in salvation, the nature of Christ's presence in the Lord's Supper, and the extent of human free will. In 1576, Augustus, Elector of Saxony convened a conference in Torgau (northwest Saxony) to address these issues. The conference included many well-respected Lutheran theologians such as Jakob Andreae and Martin Chemnitz, and led to the drafting of the twelve the articles known as the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="concordia" text="Formula of Concord" />*, which was formally adopted in 1577. The *Formula of Concord* has two sections: the *Epitome* (a concise presentation of the twelve articles), and the *Solid Declaration* (a detailed exposition of the twelve articles). [^91]

## The Book of Concord

In 1580, the authoritative Lutheran statements of faith were compiled into a collection known as *The Book of Concord*. *The Book of Concord* includes the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed (which the book calls "The Three Ecumenical Creeds"), *The Augsburg Confession*, the *Apology of the Augsburg Confession*, the *Smalcald Articles*, the *Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope*, *The Small Catechism*, *The Large Catechism*, and the *Formula of Concord*. It also contains a preface signed by 51 electors, bishops, princes, and nobles of the Holy Roman Empire and representatives of 35 free imperial cities, as well as a supplement of citations from the Church Fathers called the *Catalogue of Testimonies*. These writings, also referred to as the "Lutheran Confessions" or the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="symbolon" text='"Symbolical Books of the Lutheran Church"' />, are adhered to by Lutherans to this day.[^92]

## The Tübingen Correspondence

The early Lutherans recognized the concerns they shared with the Eastern Orthodox Church regarding the papacy.[^93] Moreover, the early Lutherans held that traditions instituted by men need not be everywhere alike.[^94]

In 1575, a group of Lutheran theologians from Tübingen (southwestern Germany), including Jakob Andreae, sent a Greek version of the *The Augsburg Confession* to Patriarch of Constantinople Jeremias II in attempts to open an ecumenical dialog. This led to a theological correspondence which took place between 1576 and 1581, in which both sides sent three letters each. This is known as the Tübingen Correspondence.

In their letters, both sides agreed on the nature of Scripture as the inspired word of God, the Trinity, the two natures of Christ, Christ's saving office, the future second coming, and the final judgment. They also both rejected the sale of indulgences, obligatory priestly celibacy, and the withholding of Communion in both kinds. Despite these agreements, however, the two sides could not reach an accord on the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, the nature of free will, the nature of justification, the number of sacraments, praying to the saints, and the veneration of icons.

Regarding these disagreements, Jeremias urged the scholars of Tübingen to abandon their "innovations" and embrace the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Lutheran theologians, however, defended their position, insisting that their teachings were not innovations, but were grounded in Holy Scripture. In response, Jeremias denounced the Lutheran theologians as heretics and requested that they cease all correspondence with him on matters of doctrine.[^95][^96]

## Jacobus Arminius

Jacobus Arminius was a 16th-century pastor and theologian in the Dutch Reformed Church who studied under Theodore Beza, John Calvin's successor. Arminius grew concerned that the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election had the unintended consequence of implying that God is the author of sin, and proposed a conception of predestination that attempted to strike a balance between God's sovereignty and human free will.

In Arminius' view, God created man with free will and foreknew both his fall and ultimate salvation in Christ. Accordingly, God bestowed the grace necessary for repentance and faith while knowing from all eternity who would believe and persevere and who would not. Thus, God's absolute sovereignty over human actions is upheld in a way that neither negates human responsibility nor makes him the author of sin.[^97]

Arminius' views were challenged by the Dutch Calvinists. Following his death, his ideas provoked ample discussion at the Synod of Dort (western Netherlands), held from 1618 to 1619, in which the Dutch Reformed Church rejected Arminianism and affirmed The Five Points of Calvinism.[^98]
