## The Sabbath

Weekly, 7th day, Saturday

- Hebrew: ***<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shabbat" text="Shabbat" />***
- Day of rest
- *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shabbat-shalom" text="Shabbat shalom" />* means "peaceful Sabbath".
- "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation" (Gen. 2:1-3).
- "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy" (Ex. 20:8-11).
- "It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed" (Ex. 31:17).
- "Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work. It is a Sabbath to the Lord in all your dwelling places" (Lev. 23:3).
- "You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day" (Deut. 5:15).
- Signifies God's pattern for creation, and that every aspect of our lives should reflect we belong to him and are sustained by his hand. Further, we have been set free from harsh slavery and should live with constant gratitude for our Creator and Redeemer.

Then he entered the Most Holy Place with incense, so that the smoke covered the mercy seat over the Ark of the Covenant. Then the blood of the offerings was sprinkled on the mercy seat to make atonement for himself, his house, and all Israel. He also sprinkled blood on the horns of the altar to cleanse and consecrate it. Then, he took two goats to the entrance of the Tabernacle.

- Celebrating God's deliverance of the Jews against their Persian enemies operating under the decree of Haman to annihilate the Jews during the reign of Ahasuerus (Xerxes).
