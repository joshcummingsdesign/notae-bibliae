God created us, body and soul, and both are to be cherished as sacred gifts (Gen. 2:7). Furthermore, we were made to move and work, reflecting his design (Gen. 2:15). Throughout history, two main factors, broadly speaking, have driven us to move and work: agriculture and self-defense. Regarding the latter, many nations—each with their own gods and spiritual practices—developed some form of martial arts. This is important to keep in mind as we look at the theology of exercise as it relates to our lives today.

In our modern Western world, where we have relative peace and grocery stores, we must find ways to keep our bodies moving and working as God intended. While there are a plethora of activities from which to choose, it is important to recognize that many physical practices—such as Tai Chi, Qigong, and Capoeira—have retained their spiritual roots. Further, some physical practices are are inherently spiritual—like Yoga, which is rooted in Hinduism. Therefore, when choosing a physical practice, it is important to discern carefully whether it conflicts with one’s spirituality, morality, or philosophy, in order to avoid syncretism.

Besides syncretism, there are other things one must consider when taking on a physical practice. For example, one must not so elevate the body that the soul is neglected or that one becomes vain (1 Sam. 16:7) (Prov. 31:30) (Matt. 23:27-28) (John 7:24) (1 Tim. 2:9) (1 Tim. 4:8) (1 Peter 3:3-4). Conversely, one must not neglect the body or abuse it, as it is a gift from the Lord (1 Cor. 3:17) (1 Cor. 6:9-10) (1 Cor. 6:12-20) (Eph. 5:5) (Rom. 12:1).

Aside from general health and wellness, there are other reasons one might take on a physical practice—such as cultivating temperance and self-discipline, or preparing one’s body for godly physical demands, like helping a family member or neighbor, or engaging in ministry and other acts of service. Ultimately, any physical practice we pursue should be done in a manner that honors the Lord (Gal. 5:22-23) (1 Cor. 9:24-27) (1 Cor. 10:31) (Eph. 5:15-18) (Col. 3:23-24) (2 Peter 1:5-7).
