## Restored Classical Pronunciation

- Vowels are **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, **u** (IPA)
- The "c" is hard like the "k" in "key"
- The second-to-last (penultimate) syllable gets the stress if it's a long syllable, otherwise it's the third-to-last (antepenultimate) syllable. Long syllables end with long vowels which have macrons, or end in a consonant.

  - *Dēceptus* – dē-**cep**-tus
  - *Macellum* – ma-**cel**-lum
  - *Agitur* – **a**-gi-tur
  - *Amāverās* – a-**mā**-ve-rās
  - *Venīre* – ve-**nī**-re
  - Dominus – **do**-mi-nus

## Germanic Ecclesiastical Pronunciation

- The fricative "v" sound is used (Vulgar Latin, 2nd century)
- The letters "ph" make the "f" sound (Vulgar Latin, 2nd century)
- The letters "ti" plus a vowel make the "tsi" sound (Vulgar Latin, 2nd century)
- The diphthong "ae" becomes "e" (Rustic Latin, 2nd century)
- When "c" precedes the "i" or "e" sound, it becomes "tsi" or "tse" respectively (Germanic Ecclesiastical Pronunciation, Middle Ages)

## Italian Ecclesiastical Pronunciation

- When "c" precedes the "i" or "e" sound, it becomes "chi" or "che" respectively (Italian Ecclesiastical Pronunciation, Middle Ages)
- When "g" precedes the "i" or "e" sound, it becomes "ji" or "je" respectively (Italian Ecclesiastical Pronunciation, Middle Ages)
- The letters "gn" use the "ñ" sound (Italian Ecclesiastical Pronunciation, Middle Ages)
- The letter "h" is silent, except for "mihi" which sounds like "miki" and "nihil" which sounds like "nikil" (Italian Ecclesiastical Pronunciation, Middle Ages)
