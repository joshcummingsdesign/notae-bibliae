**Q:** Who is God?<br/>
**A:** God is he who created everything—the sky, the trees, the mountains, all the animals, and even us (Gen. 1:1). He didn't have to create us ([ST I, q. 46, a. 1, co., par. 1](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q46.A1.C)), but out of his great love he created us to share in his very life (2 Peter 1:3-4). And he loves us so much that he sent us Jesus (John 3:16).

**Q:** Who is Jesus?<br/>
**A:** God sent a man named Jesus into the world to show us what God is really like (John 1:18)—that he is loving, gracious, and merciful (John 17:26). Jesus taught, healed, and forgave people, and even said that he was God (John 8:58). People didn't believe that he was God, so they rose up to kill him (Matt. 26:3-4), but before he was put to death, he said that he would give up his life so that whoever believed in him would never have to die again (John 3:16) (John 10:17-18) (Matt. 26:28). He was killed (Matt. 27:31), and when everyone who loved him was very sad about his death (John 20:11), God brought him back to life to prove that everything he said was true (Matt. 28:5-6). Then he promised to send us the Holy Spirit (John 14:15-17).

**Q:** What is the Holy Spirit?<br/>
**A:** The Holy Spirit is God's personal presence in our lives (Ezek. 36:27). Jesus promised that God would send the Holy Spirit to everyone who believes in him (John 14:15-17). The Holy Spirit gives us gifts like wisdom, knowledge, understanding, love, joy, peace, and patience (Isa. 11:2-3) (Gal. 5:22-23), so that we may walk through this life with Jesus until we meet him again in heaven (John 14:2) (John 16:13).

**Q:** What is wisdom?<br/>
**A:** Knowledge is knowing something. Understanding is knowing why it matters. Wisdom is knowing how to apply our knowledge and understanding at the right time and in the right way in our lives.

**Q:** What is heaven?<br/>
**A:** Heaven is where God lives (1 Tim. 6:16). We can't see it now, but we will see it one day (John 14:2).

**Q:** When will we see heaven?<br/>
**A:** Only God knows the answer to that (Matt. 24:36), but Jesus promised that everyone who believes in him will see it (John 6:40).
