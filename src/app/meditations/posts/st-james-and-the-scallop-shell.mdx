Legend has it that after St. James of Zebedee was martyred in Jerusalem by Herod Agrippa (Acts 12:1-2), his disciples, accompanied by an angel of the Lord, brought his holy body to Joppa (modern Tel-Aviv on the Mediterranean coastline), where they found ready prepared for them a miraculous ship, in which they set sail with favorable breezes and a calm sea. On the seventh day, they approached the harbor of Iria Flavia on the Galician coast (modern northwest Spain), and behold, one who had the appearance of a man was riding on the crests of the waves on a horse. The horse plunged into the sea, and emerged covered in scallop shells. The scallop shell then became an emblem of protection for their journey.

When the disciples reached their destination, they moored the boat to a great stone by the side of a wide crossing of the river. The stone became known as El Padrón (Spanish: “The Protector”, but also sounds like pedrón, which means “large stone”). Lady Lupa, Roman matron, ruled that the holy body should be buried, and lent the men an oxcart. The disciples placed the holy body on the oxcart, and the beasts took off as if knowing the way. They arrived at the hill of Libredón, where at the very presence of the holy body, a statue of a pagan god crumbled to the ground. The disciples built a stone sepulchre, and therein placed the holy body of St. James.

As time went on an altar and a chapel were built, and a company of monks was established. Facing persecution, the monks concealed the holy sepulchre and fled. In 812, an anchorite named Palagio and his company of men saw an exceedingly bright star shining over Libredón. They told Teodomiro, bishop of Iria Flavia, and on Sunday July 25, the holy sepulchre of St. James was uncovered. Before long a city was established nearby called Santiago de Compostela (Latin: Sanctus Iacobus, “St. James”, campus, “camp”, and stella, “star”), which became a major site of Christian pilgrimage.[^1]

The scallop shell went on to become an important symbol in Christianity, not only of St. James, but also St. Augustine, who had a vision of a child who told him that he could sooner empty the ocean with a shell than understand the Trinity. The scallop shell is now commonly associated with Holy Baptism, as a shell is a practical and symbolic means of pouring water over one’s head in the name of the Trinity.[^2]
