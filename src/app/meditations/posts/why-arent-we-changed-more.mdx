When asked in a Q&A, Rev. Thomas Joseph White, O.P., rector of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in Rome, answers the question, "Why aren't we changed more?"

> "We are changed as we cooperate with faith, hope, and love progressively and according to the measure God wills, and also God wisely leaves in us weaknesses so that we realize our dependence in Christ. Christians live now the redemption of Christ on a battlefield. Through the thicket of drama we walk after Christ in view of union with him by faith, hope, and love, imitating him in and through death in view of eternal life and eventual resurrection. It requires faith. It requires hope. It isn't something seen."
