Singing has been part of the Christian liturgy since the earliest days of the Church. To the early Jewish Christians, chanting the Scriptures—particularly the Psalms—was a continuation of their heritage. For centuries, chanting served as a mnemonic device to preserve and transmit sacred texts in an oral culture before widespread literacy or written texts were accessible. The melodic nature of chant helps worshippers connect emotionally and spiritually with the liturgy. It also creates an atmosphere of reverence and sanctity, distinguishing prayer and scripture from ordinary speech. Chanting often involves the congregation, fostering a sense of unity and collective worship; and it connects us with our ancestors, reinforcing a sense of historical and cultural continuity.

Early Christian rites incorporated elements of Jewish worship that survived in later chant tradition. Canonical hours have their roots in Jewish prayer hours. <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="amen" text="Amen" /> and <Definition lang="latin" anchor="alleluia" text="alleluia" /> come from Hebrew, and the threefold *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="sanctus" text='"sanctus"' />* derives from the threefold *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="kadosh" text='"kadosh"' />* of the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="kedushah" text="Kedushah" />.

Musical elements that would later be used in the Roman Rite began to appear in the 3rd century. The *Apostolic Tradition*, attributed to St. Hippolytus, attests the singing of the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hallel" text="Egyptian Hallel Psalms" /> with *"alleluia"* as the refrain. Chants sung during the [Liturgy of the Hours](/liturgy/rites/liturgy-of-the-hours-benedictine-rite), have their roots in the early 4th century, when the [Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers) introduced the practice of continuous psalmody, singing the complete cycle of 150 psalms each week.

Around 375, antiphonal psalmody became popular in the Christian East. In 386, [St. Ambrose](/people/saints/latin-fathers/ambrose-of-milan) introduced this practice to the West. In the 5th century, a <Definition lang="latin" anchor="schola-cantorum" text="Schola Cantorum" /> was founded in Rome to provide training in church musicianship.

Around 410, [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) described the responsorial singing of a [gradual](/glossary/liturgical-terms#gradual) at Mass. In his book *De Musica* (Latin: "On Music"), he describes how chant allows the soul to easily move from the beauty of the music, received by the senses, to contemplation of God's transcendent beauty.

Around 520, [St. Benedict](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) wrote the *Rule of Saint Benedict*, which organized and codified the Liturgy of the Hours for use in Western monastic communities.

In the 6th century, [Pope St. Gregory the Great](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great) reorganized the Schola Cantorum in Rome, and systematized the use of chant by collecting, arranging, and assigning particular pieces to the liturgical services of the Western Church. While others later magnified his achievements, these significant steps account for why Gregorian chant bears his name.
