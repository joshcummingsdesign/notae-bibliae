After Jesus' resurrection, he told the disciples, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matt. 28:19-20). Fifty days later in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, and empowered them to share the gospel with the Jews at Pentecost. St. Peter gave a sermon that caused the Jews at Pentecost to be "cut to the heart" (Acts 2:37). The Jews asked what to do, and Peter told them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself" (Acts 2:38-39). Those who received his word—about 3,000 people—were then baptized (Acts 2:41). This pattern of hearing the gospel, repenting, and being baptized is the way that all future Christians would be brought into full communion as church members.

The 1st century *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="didakhe" text="Didache" />*—the first example of church orders—explains that new believers, or <Definition lang="greek" anchor="katekhoumenos" text="catechumens" />, were to go through a process of <Definition lang="greek" anchor="katekhesis" text="catechesis" />, and that one had to be baptized before receiving the Eucharist. It goes on to explain that after catechesis, the catechumens were to partake in the sacraments of Baptism and First Communion. It specifies that if baptism by immersion could not be performed, water was to be poured on the head three times in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. It also states that before Baptism, the catechumen was to fast for one or two days.

In the 2nd century, [St. Justin Martyr](/people/saints/greek-fathers/justin-martyr) described a similar process to the one outlined in the *Didache*, as did [Tertullian](/people/scholars/tertullian); though Tertullian also described the process of Confirmation, which involved the laying on of hands to receive the Holy Spirit. Tertullian also explained that although one could be baptized on any day, Easter was the most appropriate time, as it connects the resurrection of Christ to Baptism (Rom. 6:4). Tertullian went on to say that Pentecost would be the second-most appropriate time for Baptism.

In the 3rd century, [St. Hippolytus](/people/saints/early/hippolytus-of-rome) described a threefold process of catechesis. In the first stage, the catechumen was interviewed about whether they were prepared to take on the responsibility of living as a Christian. In the second stage, they entered a three-year process of instruction in the faith. Requiring the individual to spend three years learning about the faith helped to ensure that people were sincere in their commitment to Christ. In the third stage, they would enter a period of fasting and prayer before they partook in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and First Communion.

Both Hippolytus and [St. Cyril of Jerusalem](/people/saints/greek-fathers/cyril-of-jerusalem) (4th century) described removing one's clothes before Baptism, as it signifies putting off the old self and putting on the righteousness of Christ (Eph. 4:22-24). Over time, white robes were put on both for modesty and to signify that we have been washed in the blood of the Lamb (Rev. 7:14) and clothed in white (Rev. 3:5).

In the 4th century, [St. Augustine](/people/saints/latin-fathers/augustine-of-hippo) emphasized salvation by God's grace (Eph. 2:8-9) and the necessity of Baptism as a saving act (1 Peter 3:21), which meant that to delay Baptism was to delay the free gift of God's salvation.

Over time, the three-year period of instruction was reduced to the 40 days of Lent, which not only allowed for a period of instruction, fasting, and prayer, but also allowed the catechumen to experience their Baptism in connection with Christ's resurrection during its commemoration at the Easter Vigil. The sacraments of Confirmation and First Communion remained, however, those who were baptized as infants now typically receive them in a separate liturgical service during the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="paschalis" text="Paschal" /> season.
