The Liturgy of the Hours, also known as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="officium" text="Divine Office" /> or *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="opus-dei" text="Opus Dei" />*, is a daily prayer liturgy at regular intervals known as the canonical hours. It marks the hours of each day and sanctifies the day with prayer.

## The Psalms

The Psalms were composed and sung by the likes of Moses, Asaph, Heman, Ethan, the sons of Korah, Solomon, and most notably David. When the ark of the covenant was brought to the location where the temple would be built on Mount Zion, Daivd appointed Asaph and his brothers to minister before the Lord with songs of thanksgiving (2 Chron. 16:7). When the ark was brought into the temple, the singers—arrayed in white linen—raised their song, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple (2 Chron. 5:11-14). The songs of thanksgiving continued on through the temple dedication (2 Chron. 7:6).

The five books of the 150 Psalms were compiled over six centuries from the time of David to Ezra and Nehemiah, and used in regular Jewish worship,[^1] and were chanted <Definition lang="english" anchor="antiphonal" text="antiphonally" />.[^2]

## Thrice Daily Prayer

Regular daily prayer in Christianity continued the practice of the Jewish tradition. Sacrifices in the tabernacle were offered twice each day—morning and evening (Exod. 29:38-39)—while Jewish prayer was observed three times daily (Ps. 55:17) (Dan. 6:10): at the third hour (Ps. 88:13) (Acts 2:15), the sixth hour (Acts 10:9), and the ninth hour (Acts 3:1).

The early Christians continued on in the regular singing of psalms and the three times of daily prayer. In the 1st century, the *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="didakhe" text="Didache" />*—the first example of church orders—prescribed praying the Lord's Prayer three times a day.[^3] In the 2nd and 3rd centuries, [Tertullian](/people/scholars/tertullian) and [St. Cyprian](/people/saints/latin-fathers/cyprian-of-carthage) describe both the observance of the three daily prayer hours and the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer. The 4th-century *Apostolic Constitutions* also prescribe the observance of the three daily prayer hours along with morning and evening prayer.[^4]

## The Eight Canonical Hours

In the 6th century, [St. Benedict](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) composed his *Rule* for monks living in a community under the authority of an abbot. In it, he outlined a seven-day psalter, so that by the end of each week all 150 psalms would have been chanted—a task, he notes, that his predecessors had accomplished within a single day.[^5]

St. Benedict—drawing from the [Apostolic Fathers](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers), [Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers), and [St. John Cassian](/people/saints/early/john-cassian)—gives a detailed description of the Divine Office as eight canonical hours: [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins), [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds), [Prime](/glossary/liturgical-terms#prime), [Terce](/glossary/liturgical-terms#terce), [Sext](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sext), [None](/glossary/liturgical-terms#none), [Vespers](/glossary/liturgical-terms#vespers), and [Compline](/glossary/liturgical-terms#compline). This, Benedict associated with Psalm 119:164, "Seven times a day I praise you," and Psalm 119:62, "At midnight I rise to praise you." Although his *Rule* prescribed an order for the weekly psalms, St. Benedict allowed adjustments to the sequence, provided the entire psalter was completed each week.[^6]

## The Eight Gregorian Tones

Later in the 6th century, [Pope St. Gregory the Great](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great) more formally established an order for the seven-day psalter, and organized the corpus of plainchant for the Western Church. Thus, Gregorian chant bears his name. Drawing on the Eastern system of eight chant tones, called the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="octoechos" text="Octoechos" />, the eight chant tones for Gregorian chant were further systemized in the years that followed, and came to be known as the Eight Gregorian Tones.[^8][^9][^10]

## The Sarum Rite

Gregorian chant made its way into England during the Gregorian Mission, and by the 11th century, the Latin liturgy used at Salisbury Cathedral in southern England began to develop and refine its local form of ceremony, chant, and calendar. They simplified the psalter and the system of the Eight Gregorian Tones. This form, which became known as the <Definition lang="english" anchor="sarum" text="Sarum Rite" />, or <Definition lang="latin" anchor="usus" text="Use of Sarum" />, greatly shaped the liturgical practices of the English Church until the time of the Reformation.[^11][^12]

## The Daily Office

In the Middle Ages, the Divine Office had developed into a very beautiful, yet highly complex system of prayer and praise, shaped almost exclusively for monastic and clerical life. Regular feast days often interrupted the weekly psalms, and the demands of daily life made it difficult for the laity to participate in the regular offices.[^13][^14]

This concern was shared by the Reformers in England, especially [Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer](/meditations/a-brief-history-of-the-reformation-part-3#the-book-of-common-prayer), who in 1549 produced the *Book of Common Prayer*, setting the entire Latin liturgy in the English vernacular.[^15] Drawing heavily on the Sarum Rite,[^16] it simplified the complex medieval system of seven daily offices into two—Matins and Evensong—known as the Daily Office. Accompanied by a monthly psalter and a scriptural cycle of readings, this reform aimed to make daily worship both accessible and intelligible to the laity, restoring their active participation in the Church's continual offering of praise and prayer.[^17]
