The Liturgy of the Hours, also known as the <Definition lang="latin" anchor="officium" text="Divine Office" /> or *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="opus-dei" text="Opus Dei" />*, is a daily prayer liturgy at regular intervals known as the canonical hours. It marks the hours of each day and sanctifies the day with prayer.

## The Psalms

The Psalms were composed and sung by the likes of Moses, Asaph, Heman, Ethan, the sons of Korah, Solomon, and most notably David. When the ark of the covenant was brought to the location where the temple would be built on Mount Zion, Daivd appointed Asaph and his brothers to minister before the Lord with songs of thanksgiving (2 Chron. 16:7). When the ark was brought into the temple, the singers—arrayed in white linen—raised their song, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple (2 Chron. 5:11-14). The songs of thanksgiving continued on through the temple dedication (2. Chron. 7:6).

The five books of the 150 Psalms were compiled over six centuries from the time of David to Ezra and Nehemiah, and used in regular Jewish worship, and were chanted <Definition lang="english" anchor="antiphonally" text="antiphonally" />.

## Thrice Daily Prayer

Regular daily prayer in Christianity continued the practice of the Jewish tradition. Sacrifices in the tabernacle were offered twice each day—morning and evening (Exod. 29:38-39)—while Jewish prayer was observed three times daily (Ps. 55:17) (Dan. 6:10): at the third hour (Ps. 88:13) (Acts 2:15), the sixth hour (Acts 10:9), and the ninth hour (Acts 3:1).

The early Christians continued on in the regular singing of psalms and the three times of daily prayer. In the 1st century, the *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="didakhe" text="Didache" />*—the first example of church orders—prescribed praying the Lord’s Prayer three times a day. In the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and Origen describe both the observance of the three daily prayer hours and the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer.

## The Eight Canonical Hours

In the 6th century, [St. Benedict](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia) composed his *Rule* for monks living in a community under the authority of an abbot. In it, he outlined a seven-day psalter, so that by the end of each week all 150 psalms would have been chanted—a task, he notes, that his predecessors had accomplished within a single day.

St. Benedict—drawing from the [Apostolic Fathers](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers), [Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers), and [St. John Cassian](/people/saints/early/john-cassian)—gives a detailed description of the Divine Office as eight canonical hours: [Matins](/glossary/liturgical-terms#matins), [Lauds](/glossary/liturgical-terms#lauds), [Prime](/glossary/liturgical-terms#prime), [Terce](/glossary/liturgical-terms#terce), [Sext](/glossary/liturgical-terms#sext), [None](/glossary/liturgical-terms#none), [Vespers](/glossary/liturgical-terms#vespers), and [Compline](/glossary/liturgical-terms#compline). This, Benedict associated with Psalm 119:164, “Seven times a day I praise you,” and Psalm 119:62, “At midnight I rise to praise you.” Although his *Rule* prescribed an order for the weekly psalms, St. Benedict allowed adjustments to the sequence, provided the entire psalter was completed each week.

## The Eight Gregorian Tones

Soon after, [Pope St. Gregory the Great](/people/saints/latin-fathers/gregory-the-great) established an order for the seven-day psalter. Drawing on the Eastern system of eight chant tones—the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="octoechos" text="Octoechos" />—he organized both the eight chant tones and the corpus of plainchant for the Western Church. Thus, Gregorian chant bears his name, and its eight tones came to be known as the Eight Gregorian Tones.

## The Sarum Rite

The <Definition lang="english" anchor="sarum" text="Sarum Rite" />, or Use of Sarum, was the local form of the Latin liturgy used at Salisbury Cathedral in southern England from the 11th century until the English Reformation. Though largely conforming to the Roman Rite, it incorporated distinctive English elements of ceremony, chant, and calendar. The Sarum Rite simplified the order of the psalter, and the system of the Eight Gregorian Tones.

## The Daily Office

In the Middle Ages, the Divine Office had developed into a very beautiful, yet highly complex system of prayer and praise, shaped almost exclusively for monastic and clerical life. Regular feast days often interrupted the weekly psalms, and the demands of daily life made it difficult for the laity to participate in the regular offices.

This concern was shared by the Reformers in England, especially [Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer](/meditations/a-brief-history-of-the-reformation-part-3#the-book-of-common-prayer), who in 1549 produced the Book of Common Prayer, setting the entire Latin liturgy in the English vernacular. Drawing heavily on the Sarum Rite, it simplified the complex medieval system of seven daily offices into two—Matins and Evensong—known as the Daily Office. Accompanied by a monthly psalter and a scriptural cycle of readings, this reform aimed to make daily worship both accessible and intelligible to the laity, restoring their active participation in the Church’s continual offering of praise and prayer.
