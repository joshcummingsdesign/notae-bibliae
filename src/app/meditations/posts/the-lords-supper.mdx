## Passover Seder

On the 10th of Abib (Nisan, the first month of the year), each household was to take an unblemished lamb and keep it until the 14th day of the month (Ex. 12:3-6).

The Passover lamb was to be sacrificed on the 14th of Abib in preparation for the <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="seder" text="Passover Seder" /> on the 15th which begins at sundown on the 14th (Ex. 12:6-7).

The Passover Seder includes unleavened bread (Ex. 12:15) and four cups of wine. Two cups, followed by the breaking of the unleavened bread or *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="matzah" text="matzah" />* which is called the "bread of affliction", then the meal, and then the concluding two cups.

## The Four Cups

The four cups represent the four promises God made to Israel when he promised to deliver them from Egypt (Ex. 6:6-7):

1. "I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians."
2. "I will deliver you from slavery to them."
3. "I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment."
4. "I will take you to be my people."

The names and the order of the cups are as follows:

1. **Cup of Sanctification** (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="kiddush" text="Kiddush" />*)

   - "Blessed are you, the Lord our God, King of the Universe, Creator of the fruit of the vine."
2. **Cup of Plagues** (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="maggid" text="Maggid" />*)

   - Breaking of the bread of affliction
   - Meal
3. **Cup of Redemption** (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="birkat-hamazon" text="Birkat Hamazon" />*)
4. **Cup of Praise** (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hallel" text="Hallel" />*)

## Institution of the Lord's Supper

Jesus gives the blessing (*Kiddush*) and says, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves. For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes" (Luke 22:17-18).

At the breaking of the bread of affliction Jesus says, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19) (cf. Matt. 26:26) (cf. Mark 14:22) (cf. 1 Cor. 11:24).

At the meal there was no lamb (Isa. 53:5) (John 1:29) (John 10:17-18).

At the Cup of Redemption Jesus says, "Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the new testament, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:27-28) (cf. Mark 14:23-24) (cf. Luke 22:20) (cf. 1 Cor. 11:25) (cf. Ex. 12:23) (cf. Ex. 24:8) (cf. Jer. 31:31-34).

## Significance

The Lord's Supper is a sacrament in which God offers us the grace of forgiveness of sins using the sign of Christ's body and blood.

### A Testament

Martin Luther beautifully highlights the significance of the testament Christ instituted in the Lord's Supper.

> "A testament, as everyone knows, is a promise made by one about to die, in which he designates his bequest and appoints his heirs. A testament, therefore, involves first, the death of the testator, and second, the promise of an inheritance and the naming of the heir…Christ testifies concerning his death when he says, 'This is my body, which is given, this is my blood, which is poured out.' (Luke 22:19-20). He names and designates the bequest when he says, 'For the forgiveness of sins.' (Matt. 26:28). But he appoints the heirs when he says, 'For you and for many,' (Luke 22:19-20) (Matt. 26:28) that is, for those who accept and believe the promise of the testator. For here it is faith that makes men heirs…"

He further explains that in this testament, Christ not only gave us his word, but his seal.

> "Quite commonly God has given along with the word a sign as a further assurance and strengthening of faith. Noah was given the sign of the rainbow, Abraham of circumcision, Gideon of the dew upon the fleece. This happens when men make a will. There is not only a word, but also a notary's seal to show that it is valid and trustworthy; and so Christ in making his testament attached a seal and sign to the words, namely his own true flesh and blood under the bread and wine.
>
> <cite>Luther, WA 6:538–539</cite>

Finally, he summarizes the whole meaning of the Sacrament.

> "[It is as if Christ] were saying, 'Behold, O sinful and condemned man, out of the pure and unmerited love with which I love you, and by the will of the Father of mercies, apart from any merit or desire of yours, I promise you in these words the forgiveness of all your sins and life everlasting. And that you may be absolutely certain of this irrevocable promise of mine, I shall give my body and pour out my blood, confirming this promise by my very death, and leaving you my body and blood as a sign and memorial of this same promise. As often as you partake of them, remember me, proclaim and praise my love and bounty toward you, and give thanks.'"

### A Union

The Lord's Supper is also sometimes called the Eucharist, which comes from the Greek word *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="eukharistia" text="eukharistia" />*, which means "thanksgiving" (Luke 22:17). It is also sometimes called Communion, and signifies both our union with Christ and with other believers (1 Cor. 10:16-17).

> "We commune not only by participating and partaking, but also by being united. For as [Christ's human] body is united to [him], so also are we united to him by this bread…For what is the bread? The body of Christ. And what do they become who partake of it? The body of Christ—not many bodies, but one body. For as the bread consisting of many grains is made one, so that the grains nowhere appear—they exist indeed, but their difference is not seen by reason of their conjunction—so are we conjoined both with each other and with Christ."
>
> <cite>[St. John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on First Corinthians](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/220124.htm)</cite>

### A Gift

Many of the Church Fathers spoke of the Eucharist as a sacrifice, however, Luther reminds us not to see it as our act for God, but rather God's gift to us.

> "Who in the world is so foolish as to regard a promise received by him, or a testament given to him, as a good work, which he renders to the testator by his acceptance of it?…We mock the mercy of the giver by giving as a work the thing we receive as a gift, so that the testator, instead of being a dispenser of his own goods, becomes the recipient of ours…For the bread and wine are offered beforehand for blessing in order that they may be sanctified by the word and by prayer, but after they have been blessed and consecrated they are no longer offered, but received as a gift from God."
>
> <cite>[Luther, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church, p. 26-30](https://www.onthewing.org/user/Luther%20-%20Babylonian%20Captivity.pdf)</cite>

### A Reality

One might ask: In what way are the bread and wine Christ's body and blood? Luther explains that by virtue of Christ's word in the Sacrament, his body and blood are made a present reality in the bread and wine in a supernatural way ([LC 5:14](https://bookofconcord.org/large-catechism/sacrament-of-the-altar/)); and that by believing in his word, we have what it says, namely the forgiveness of sins ([SC 6:4](https://bookofconcord.org/small-catechism/the-sacrament-of-the-altar/#0004)). For where there is forgiveness of sins, there is also life and salvation ([SC 6:3](https://bookofconcord.org/small-catechism/the-sacrament-of-the-altar/#0003)).

## Conclusion

The Lord's Supper is our true Passover meal (1 Cor. 5:7), our bread from heaven (John 6:31-33), and a foretaste of the heavenly banquet (Rev. 19:6-9). In the Lord's Supper, Jesus presents himself to us and asks if we receive his body and blood given for us for the forgiveness of sins. We respond in the affirmative by partaking.
