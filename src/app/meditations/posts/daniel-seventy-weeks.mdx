## Overview

An analysis of the prophecy of 70 weeks from the book of Daniel. As the 70 years that Jeremiah prophesied is coming to an end, Daniel prays in repentance and is visited by Gabriel, who tells him that there will be 70 weeks until the end of transgression and sin, atonement for iniquity, the fulfillment of the Prophets, the anointing of a most holy place, and the coming of the Messiah.

## Meaning

- 7 represents completion (Gen. 2:2)
- 1 week = 7 years (Lev. 25:8)
- 1 year = 360 days (Rev. 11:2-3)
- 70 weeks means 70 x 7, ultimate completion
- 70 weeks = 70 x 7 years = 490 years

## Context

**605 BC**

Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II besieges Jerusalem and begins taking Israelites to Babylon to educate them to gain political power. Daniel is taken to Babylon. Jeremiah prophesies 70 years of captivity (Jer. 25:11).

**539 BC**

Babylon falls to Persia. Realizing Jeremiah's prophecy of 70 years is almost complete, Daniel prays and God sends the angel Gabriel to reveal to him that there will be 70 weeks until there will be atonement, an end to transgression and sin, and the anointing of a most holy place.

## Prophecy

**Daniel 9:24**

- End of transgression and sin
- Atonement for iniquity
- Everlasting righteousness
- Fulfillment of the Prophets
- Anointing of a most holy place

**Daniel 9:25-26**

- Decree to rebuild Jerusalem
- 7 weeks + 62 weeks = 69 weeks = 483 years
- Messiah comes
- Messiah cut off
- City and sanctuary destroyed by Desolator

**Daniel 9:27**

- Desolator makes a covenant for 1 week
- Sacrifice and offering ceased for 1/2 week
- Abomination of Desolation comes
- Decreed end is poured out on the Desolator

## Theory of Fulfillment

**538 BC**

Cyrus, king of Persia, makes a decree to rebuild the temple, thus fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecy of 70 years of exile (2 Chron. 36:23).

**444 BC (0 years, Decree to rebuild Jerusalem)**

Artaxerxes, king of Persia, authorizes Nehemiah to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem which had been destroyed (Neh. 2:5).

**33 AD (483 years, Messiah comes / cut off)**

Jesus makes his Triumphal Entry (Matt. 21:10).

**Future (7-year period, Abomination of Desolation)**

## Takeaway

Whatever the theory you hold about the fulfillment of this prophecy, God gave Daniel a promise that lasted 490 years; a promise that he would deliver his people, put an end to sin, and forgive them. Sometimes God asks us to hang on longer. We see that we are reaching the peak of the mountain, and God reveals to us a new summit. The 70 years of captivity were coming to an end, and God reveals to Daniel that atonement will take 7 times longer. God is faithful. Trust in his promises no matter how long it takes.
