The Our Father, also called the Lord's Prayer, is the prayer Jesus taught his disciples, both in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 6:9-13) and when one of his disciples asked him how to pray (Luke 11:2-4). It includes an address ("Our Father..."), seven petitions ("Hallowed be thy name..."), and a doxology ("For thine is the kingdom..."). The 15th-century *Myroure of Our Ladye*, written for the Bridgettine Sisters of Syon Abbey in West London, expounds upon the rich meaning of the Our Father in great detail.

> **Our Father.**
>
> Think now that just as a child goes trustingly to his father, whatever sickness or trouble he is in, so you—whatever sickness, trouble, temptation, or sin you are in—should humbly and trustingly lift up your hearts to God your Father and tell him what troubles you. And say to him, "Our Father." You do not say "my Father", but "our Father", teaching us to have great charity and love toward one another and toward all our fellow Christians, inasmuch as we are all children of one Father, to whom we all say together, "Our Father."
>
> **Who art in heaven.**
>
> Therefore lift up your hearts from earthly and vain things, and offer them to him who is not only in heaven above in glory, but also dwelling within his servants by grace, which is here called heaven. And in every place he is, by his being, by his presence, and by his power. Think then, wherever you are, that God your Father is present before you, beneath you, with you, and all around you, and within each of your hearts by grace, so long as you are free from the power of deadly sin. And with this awareness, say to him with great love and joy and reverence, "Our Father, who art in heaven."
>
> **Hallowed be thy name.**
>
> That is, may the worship and love of your holy name be firmly established in our minds, that whatever we think, say, or do, we may always intend the holiness and praise of your holy name, and not the vanity of our own. And that our life be so holy that your name be hallowed and worshiped thereby in us. And, Father, that this may be so: *Thy kingdom come.*
>
> **Thy kingdom come.**
>
> That is, may the lordship of all sin be cast out of us, and may you so reign in us by your grace and abundance of all virtues, that we may be ready to desire your coming in the fullness of your kingdom on the Day of Judgment or at the end of our lives...Thus in this petition you ask that God may reign in you and in your fellow Christians by grace, and that both you and others—the living and the dead—may come to the kingdom of heaven.
>
> **Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.**
>
> That is, as your saints in heaven are conformed in all things to your will, so give us the will and strength to desire and fulfill your will in all things, even if it be contrary to our own vain wills. So that if you will have us in sickness or in tribulation, in well-being or in woe, in heaven, on earth, or in hell, your fatherly will be done in us.
>
> Think not that our Father will have any of his children in hell. But our obedience to our Father ought to be fervent and simple, so that we take no heed of heaven nor of hell, but only of the fulfilling of our Father's will.
>
> **Give us this day our daily bread.**
>
> That is, the sustenance of our bodily life which you send us. Grant us to take it soberly, without excess, and patiently, not begrudgingly. And give us sufficiently thereof, according to our need.
>
> And give us the bread of your word this day, through heartfelt devotion in your holy service, and in prayer, and in all reading and hearing of your word.
>
> Give us, Father, the bread of your grace, with which we are comforted and strengthened to withstand evil and to do good. And give us such faith, charity, and devotion in our hearts that thereby we may receive every day the bread of your Holy Sacrament of the Altar—that is, Lord Jesus yourself—in the unity of your Church, even if we do not receive it every day with our bodily mouths.
>
> **And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.**
>
> This petition seems burdensome to those who behold the sins of others and forget their own. But if we see clearly how great and many our sins are against God, and how little in comparison any offense done against us is, we should consider it a petition of unspeakable comfort that, by the forgiveness of so little and few, we may obtain forgiveness for so many and so great.
>
> I have sinned against God and deserved punishment. Another has sinned against me and deserves correction. If I forgive the offense but not the penalty, my Father, my God, will do the same to me. But if I forgive the penalty and all, so shall God my Father forgive me. Therefore we ought to be glad when any offense is done against us in word or deed, and more glad to forgive it, with heart, word, countenance, and action, to love them and do good unto them. For by them we have occasion to obtain from God our Father the abundant and greatly-desired pardon and forgiveness of all our sins, and of all pains that we have deserved therefore.
>
> The great comfort of this petition, that it gives to a sinful soul, cannot be overstated. For he who bids us pray thus is Truth, and it cannot be in vain; but as we forgive, so shall we be forgiven. How could there be a better opportunity than to forgive and be forgiven? O how well I would fare if many had trespassed against me, that I might forgive and be forgiven!
>
> And if we are willing to forgive, yet feel contrary stirrings within ourselves, still we say this same petition trustfully to our Father, thinking thus, "Grant us, good Father, truly to forgive our trespassers, as we desire to be forgiven by you."
>
> **And lead us not into temptation.**
>
> That is, do not let us, through our own unkindness and frailty, fall into sin through any temptation. This is a petition heartily to be made. For no one can grow in virtue without temptation, nor can anyone withstand any temptation, however perfect, without the special help and grace of God. Therefore we ask our Father, fearfully and earnestly, through this petition, not to keep us from temptation, but to keep us from falling by any temptation.
>
> **But deliver us from evil.**
>
> We can neither do anything of ourselves but sin, nor can we in any way deserve anything but punishment. Therefore, humbly and fearfully knowing our own feebleness, we ask our Father to deliver us from the evil of all sin, from all peril, and from all pains, temporal and everlasting.
>
> **Amen.**
>
> This word Amen is Hebrew. Sometimes it is a word of affirmation, meaning "truly" or "faithfully." Sometimes it is a word of desire, meaning "so be it" or "let it be done." And here it is set in that sense, to show the great desire we ought to have that all that has been asked in this prayer be fulfilled. For in these seven petitions is asked all that is needful for us, both body and soul, in this life and after.
>
> Thus may you have your mind on this prayer when you say it, if you will study and labor to understand it and keep it in mind. Not that you shall have your mind on all the words that I have written, but on the sense of it. For the understanding of man—namely, when it is enlightened by grace—can grasp the meaning of words in the mind far more quickly than the tongue can speak them aloud. And therefore, while you say the words of the Our Father, I hope that your understanding will be better nourished with the inward sense of it, as I have now written—at least in part—if you faithfully apply yourself.
>
> And because our Savior made this prayer for our benefit, it is good that you always intend to say it with the special purpose for which he made it, and to ask through it all that he intended should be asked when he composed it.
