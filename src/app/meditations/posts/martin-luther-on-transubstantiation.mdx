One might ask: If Martin Luther believed that Christ’s body and blood are truly present in the Lord’s Supper, why did he reject the doctrine of transubstantiation? This is a good question, and the answer is both subtle and technical while at the same time simple and beautiful. Here’s Luther’s answer from a treatise he wrote in 1527.

> "The right hand of God is not a place, because God is essentially present in all the ends of the earth, in and through all creatures. We know that God’s arm, hand, face, spirit, and wisdom are all the same thing. We know that the whole godhead dwells bodily in Christ (Col 2:9). How, then, can it also be true that [Christ was] in the cradle, in the temple, in the wilderness, in the town and villages and gardens and fields, on the cross, in the grave—and at the same time in heaven in the bosom of the Father? If, now, according to our faith, it is true that the godhead was essentially and personally present in Christ on earth in so many places, and at the same time in heaven and with the Father, then we must conclude that the godhead is everywhere present and essentially and personally fills heaven and earth and everything with his nature and majesty…The saying that Christ sits at the right hand of God shows that his body and blood can be there and also in all other places at the same time. There is no need here for any transubstantiation or any transformation of the bread into his body. He can be there without all this because the right hand of God does not first have to be changed into all things in which it is present. We are not so crude as to suppose that Christ’s body is in the bread in so crass and visible a manner as bread is in a basket or wine is in a jar…We believe that his body is there, as the words say, ‘This is my body.’ We do not [preoccupy ourselves with how it is manifested]. We are ready to say he is in the bread, he is where the bread is, or as you will. We will not quarrel about words so long as this remains—that this is not ordinary bread which we eat in the Lord’s Supper, but it is the body of Christ.”[^1]
