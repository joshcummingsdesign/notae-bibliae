<Initial text="Martin Luther on Confession"/>

Martin Luther urged Christians to see Confession as a true gift in which the burdens of one’s conscience are lifted by God’s grace through the mouth of the pastor. This was in opposition to the Roman Catholic view of Confession, which the Lutherans perceived as coercion. Luther argued that Rome had caused many believers to dread the Sacrament, or reject it altogether. The following passage is from the 1529 revised edition of Luther’s Large Catechism, which was omitted from the Large Catechism found in the 1580 Book of Concord. In it, Luther describes Confession as a gift and a healing medicine.

> “So notice then, that Confession, as I have often said, consists of two parts. The first is my own work and action, when I lament my sins and desire comfort and refreshment for my soul. The other part is a work that God does when he declares me free of my sin through his word placed in the mouth of a man…In our view of Confession, therefore, we should sharply separate its two parts far from each other. We should place slight value on our part in it. But we should hold in high and great esteem God’s word in the absolution part of Confession. We should not proceed as if we intended to perform and offer him a splendid work, but simply to accept and receive something from him…What I am saying is that you are to concentrate on the word, on the absolution, to regard it as a great and precious and magnificently splendid treasure, and to accept it with all praise and thanksgiving to God. If this were explained in detail, and if the need that ought to move and lead us to make confession were pointed out, then one would need little urging or coercion. For everyone’s own conscience would so drive and disturb him that he would be glad to do what a poor and miserable beggar does when he hears that a rich gift of money or clothing is being handed out at a certain place. So as not to miss it, he would run there as fast as he could and would need no bailiff to beat and drive him on. Now, suppose that in place of the invitation one were to substitute a command to the effect that all beggars should run to that place, but not say why nor mention what they should look for and receive there. What else would the beggar do but make the trip with distaste, without thinking of going to get a gift but simply of letting people see what a poor, miserable beggar he is? This would bring him little joy and comfort but only greater resentment against the command that was issued…We, however, do not say that people should look at you to see how filthy you are, using you as a mirror to preen themselves. Rather, we give this counsel: If you are poor and miserable, then go to Confession and make use of its healing medicine. He who feels his misery and need will no doubt develop such a longing for it that he will run toward it with joy.”
