The 15th-century *Myroure of Our Ladye*, written for the [Bridgettine](/people/saints/medieval/bridget-of-sweden) Sisters of Syon Abbey in West London, beautifully describes the purpose of kneeling in silent prayer as a way of preparing the heart and mind for the Office.

> "Men who live in a land at war keep continual watch in cities, castles, and walled towns. And when an enemy comes near, they ring a certain bell by which all are warned to arm themselves, make ready, and go to their places of defense to fight and drive off their enemies.
>
> In the same way, we are enclosed in this holy monastery as knights in a castle, where we are besieged by a great multitude of fiends who labor night and day to gain entry to our souls and take possession of them. And often they are busiest in the nighttime, when the senses are weighed down with the heaviness of sleep, trying to overcome—or at least to vex and trouble—those over whom they could not get the upper hand by day.
>
> Therefore, when we hear the bell ring for Matins, we ought at once, as true knights of God, to rise quickly, arm ourselves with prayer, make ourselves ready by directing our intention toward God with some devout meditation, and hasten to our place of defense, the church, a place fearful to the fiends, our enemies.
>
> And there we ought to raise the long spear of our hearts' fervent desire toward heaven, and draw out the sharp sword of the Word in his holy service, striking great blows by devout singing and saying of it; whereby our enemies shall be rebuked, and we kept safe in godly praises under the banner of his protection.
>
> This readiness of coming ought not to be kept only at Matins, but at every hour of the day. For although we sometimes rest from singing or praying with our mouths, our enemies rest not from warring against us. Therefore we ought never to cease keeping our minds steadfastly fixed on God, and at the time of prayer be ready and glad to arrive—as to a stronghold for help, and as to food and spiritual comfort for our souls.
>
> And when you come to the church before the beginning of each hour, say an Our Father and a Hail Mary, kneeling, to stir your hearts to greater devotion before beginning your service. This is said in silence, showing that God is more pleased with the secret devotion of the heart, to which you ought chiefly to attend in all your service, than with the outward noise of the voice."
