In 1525, Martin Luther wrote a treatise against Andreas Karlstadt's memorial view of the Lord's Supper. Karlstadt was chancellor of the University of Wittenberg, and had even awarded Luther his doctorate in 1512. Over time, however, Karlstadt became more radical in his approach to reform, and this was reflected in his view of the Eucharist.

In his treatise, Luther first urges Karlstadt to look at the plain words of Christ in the Scripture, "This is my body…this is my blood" (Matt. 26:26-28) (Mark 14:22-24) (Luke 22:19-20) (1 Cor. 11:23-25). He then asks Karlstadt to consider what St. Paul means by "The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a communion in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a communion in the body of Christ?" (1 Cor. 10:16). Luther then refutes Karlstadt's claim that "communion" means "reflecting upon and sharing Christ's suffering," and states that it could mean nothing other than that those who partake of the Eucharist each receive the true body and blood of the one body of Christ. "[This]," says Luther, "[is why] Paul says that we are all one body, and we all partake of one bread (1 Cor. 10:17). [This] is why it has long been called the Communion, that is, a fellowship."

Luther argues that the Lord's Supper ought to be physical and outward in that we receive Christ's body and blood for the forgiveness of sins, and spiritual and inward in that we trust in Christ's word of promise above all else. Luther says Karlstadt's principal error is that he has reversed these two concepts, making it spiritual and inward by seeing the elements as mere symbols, and physical and outward by making it our work instead of God's. Further, Luther argues that in Karlstadt's view, partaking of the Eucharist depends upon one's own righteousness because it takes righteousness to share Christ's suffering.

Luther gives great comfort to the timorous by explaining that Christ's body and blood are objectively present in the Eucharist despite any human action, and that worthy reception requires only faith in the word of promise. He reminds us, however, that while Judas received the body and blood of the Lord, he partook to his own judgment.

In the end, Luther urges Karlstadt to look at the plain meaning of Scripture, rather than rely on complex spiritual interpretations.[^1]
