## Water

Water signifies new life and the death of sin.

- During creation, the Spirit hovers over the face of the waters (Gen 1:2).
- God separates the waters and creates man (Gen 1:6).
- Noah passes through the waters of the flood (Gen. 8:1)
- When the waters of the flood subside, the dove returns to Noah (Gen. 8:11)
- God promises to pour out his Spirit like water on thirsty land (Isa. 44:3).
- God promises to sprinkle us with water and put his Spirit within us (Ezek. 36:25-26).
- Ezekiel has a vision of water flowing out from the temple, making all things new (Ezek. 47:1).

## Passing Through the Water

Passing through the water signifies God's glory and salvation, the creation or renewal of a covenant with God, and public identification with God through an anointed leader.

- God parts the Red Sea and Moses leads the people of Israel through it to Mt. Sinai where God makes a covenant with them (Ex. 14:16).
- God parts the Jordan River and Joshua leads the people through it and out of the wilderness to the promised land where they renew their covenant with God (Josh. 3:5).
- Elijah and Elisha pass through the waters of the Jordan before Elijah is taken up to heaven and Elisha is given a double portion of his spirit (2 Kings 2:7-9).

## The New Testament

John the Baptist, a prophet like Elijah who was filled with the Holy Spirit from birth, leads Israel in repentance in anticipation of the Lord's coming. He brings Israel back to the Jordan River, that the waters of the covenant may pass over them once more (Acts 19:4).

Jesus comes to John to be baptized in the Jordan to inaugurate his ministry, to identify with the fallen humanity he came to redeem, and to "fulfill all righteousness" (Matt. 3:13-15). Upon doing so, the Holy Spirit descends and rests upon him, and God the Father affirms his eternal love for him (Matt. 3:16-17).

Jesus tells us we enter the kingdom of God when we are born of water and the Spirit (John 3:5).

Jesus commissions the apostles to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19).

## Significance

Baptism is a sacrament in which God offers us the grace of salvation and new life using the sign of water.

### Salvation

St. Mark tells us that when we are baptized, we are saved:

> **"Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved…"**
>
> <cite>Mark 16:16</cite>

Martin Luther defines salvation as the following:

> "To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil, and to enter into the kingdom of Christ, and to live with him forever."
>
> <cite>[LC 4:25](https://bookofconcord.org/large-catechism/holy-baptism/#lc-iv-0025-text)</cite>

St. Peter's first letter to the churches in Asia Minor wonderfully expresses how Noah's salvation through the water corresponds to our salvation through Baptism.

> **"They formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."**
>
> <cite>1 Peter 3:20-21</cite>

### New Life

St. Paul's letter to the Romans beautifully describes how Baptism signifies our death to sin and our rebirth in Christ Jesus.

> **"We were buried therefore with him by Baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life."**
>
> <cite>Romans 6:4</cite>

Luther underscores this point.

> "[Baptism] signifies that the old Adam in us should, by daily contrition and repentance, be drowned and die with all sins and evil lusts, and, again, a new man daily come forth and arise; who shall live before God in righteousness and purity forever."
>
> <cite>[SC 4:6](https://bookofconcord.org/small-catechism/the-sacrament-of-holy-baptism/#sc-baptism-0006)</cite>

### A Gift

Luther reminds us that Baptism is God's act.

> "We ought to receive Baptism at human hands just as if Christ himself, indeed, God himself, were baptizing us with his own hands. For it is not man's baptism, but Christ's and God's baptism…Look upon the person administering it as simply the vicarious instrument of God, by which the Lord sitting in heaven thrusts you under the water with his own hands, and promises you forgiveness of your sins, speaking to you upon earth with a human voice by the mouth of his minister."
>
> <cite>[Luther, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church, p. 35](https://www.onthewing.org/user/Luther%20-%20Babylonian%20Captivity.pdf)</cite>

Luther tells us that Baptism is about God's word.

> "It is not the water [alone] that [makes Baptism efficacious], but the word of God (which is in and with the water) and faith (which trusts such word of God in the water). For without the word of God, the water is simple water and no baptism. But with the word of God it is a baptism, that is, a gracious water of life and a washing of regeneration in the [Holy Spirit]."
>
> <cite>[SC 4:5](https://bookofconcord.org/small-catechism/the-sacrament-of-holy-baptism/#sc-baptism-0005)</cite>

### A Shield

Luther shows us that Baptism is a shield.

> "In [Baptism] the penitent has a shield against all assaults of the scornful enemy, an answer to the sins that disturb his conscience, an antidote for the dread of death and judgment, and a comfort in every temptation…namely, this one truth: when he says, 'God is faithful in his promises…and I received his sign in Baptism.'"
