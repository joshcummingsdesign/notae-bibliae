## History

Knotted prayer ropes were used in early Christianity; the [Desert Fathers](/people/saints/desert-fathers) are said to have created the first such, using knots to keep track of the number of times they said the Jesus prayer or the 150 psalms. [*The Rule of Saint Benedict*](/people/saints/medieval/benedict-of-nursia)—which draws on inspiration from the [Apostolic Fathers](/people/saints/apostolic-fathers), Desert Fathers, and [St. John Cassian](/people/saints/early/john-cassian)—gives a detailed description of the [Liturgy of the Hours](/liturgy/rites/liturgy-of-the-hours-benedictine-rite), in which all 150 psalms would be said in one week. Benedict points out that this task had been accomplished by his predecessors in just one day.[^1]

According to tradition, the Rosary was given to [St. Dominic](/people/saints/medieval/dominic-of-guzman) in an apparition of the [Blessed Virgin Mary](/people/saints/biblical/mary) in the year 1208. In the apparition, Our Lady told St. Dominic the intention of the Rosary is to journey in prayer through the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.[^2]

The word Rosary comes from the Latin *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="rosarium" text="rosarium" />*, which means "crown of roses", the idea being that each prayer is a rose that you string together and present as a crown to the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is also sometimes called Our Lady's Psalter, as the 150 prayers correspond to the 150 psalms. Praying through the Rosary harkens back to those monks who prayed through all 150 psalms, but makes this kind of devotion attainable to the lay person.

A "rosary" (lowercase) refers to the beaded necklace that allows one to keep track of the count of their prayers. In fact, the word "bead" actually comes from the Middle English word for prayer. The main prayer that is used in the Rosary is the [Hail Mary](/liturgy/prayers/hail-mary). A grouping of ten Hail Marys is called a <Definition lang="latin" anchor="decadem" text='"decade"' />. A rosary has five sets of ten beads, or five decades. One is to pray through the five decades three times to reach the 150 prayers.

## The Mysteries

The three times praying through the five decades of the Rosary correspond to the three groups of mysteries that one meditates on, and the five mysteries in each group. The mysteries are as follows:

### Joyful Mysteries

1. The Annunciation
2. The Visitation
3. The Nativity
4. The Presentation of Jesus at the Temple
5. The Finding of Jesus in the Temple

### Sorrowful Mysteries

1. The Agony in the Garden
2. The Scourging at the Pillar
3. The Crowning with Thorns
4. The Carrying of the Cross
5. The Crucifixion

### Glorious Mysteries

1. The Resurrection
2. The Ascension
3. Pentecost
4. The Assumption of Mary[^3]
5. The Coronation of the Virgin[^4]

## Post Vatican II

In 2002, Pope John Paul II said it is fitting that a new set of five be added, termed the Luminous Mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to 20. The Luminous mysteries are as follows:

### Luminous Mysteries

1. The Baptism of Jesus
2. The Wedding at Cana
3. Jesus' Proclamation of the Kingdom of God
4. The Transfiguration
5. The Institution of the Eucharist
