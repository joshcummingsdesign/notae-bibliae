When God speaks to Moses at Mount Sinai from the burning bush, Moses asks God what his name is (Ex. 3:13). God responds by saying, "*Ehye Asher Ehye*" (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה), which is Hebrew for "I AM WHO I AM" or "I WILL BE WHO I WILL BE". God then says he is to be called *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="ehye" text='"Ehye"' />* (Ex. 3:14), which means either "I AM" or "I WILL BE", and signifies God's nature as being eternal and unchanging.

Because it would not make sense for Moses to say "I AM" in the first person, God tells him to use the third person form, which in Biblical Hebrew is written as <Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="yhwh" text="YHWH" /> (Ex. 3:15). These four letters are known as the <Definition lang="greek" anchor="tetragrammaton" text="Tetragrammaton" />.

Since Biblical Hebrew was initially written without vowels, it is unclear how to pronounce the Tetragrammaton. Because of this, and out of great reverence for God's name (Ex. 20:7), there is a longstanding Jewish prohibition against speaking it aloud. Instead, a variety of substitutes are used, such as *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="adonai" text="Adonai" />* and *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="hashem" text="Hashem" />*.

Following the Jewish tradition, the [Septuagint](/bible/translations/septuagint) uses the word *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="kyrios" text="Kyrios" />*. The [King James Version](/bible/translations/king-james-version) uses the word "Lord", and when it is written in all uppercase as "LORD", it refers specifically to the Tetragrammaton. As followers of Christ, we believe the Tetragrammaton refers to the Triune God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit ([ST I, q. 13, a. 11, s.c.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q13.A11.SC)).
