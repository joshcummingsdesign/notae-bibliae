## *Ekklesia*

The word "church" in English comes from the Greek word *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="kuriakos" text="kuriakos" />*, which in the Bible means "belonging to the Lord", and is used in such cases as "the Lord's Supper" (1 Cor. 11:20) and "the Lord's Day" (Rev. 1:10). It is not, however, used to refer to an assembly of God's people. The word used in that case is *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="ekklesia" text="ekklesia" />*.

***Ekklesia*** can mean something narrow, like a specific congregation of believers:

"[Moses] is the one who was in the ***ekklesia*** (congregation) in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us" (Acts 7:38).

"Now there were in the ***ekklesia*** (church) at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul" (Acts 13:1).

"When [Paul] had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the ***ekklesia*** (church), and then went down to Antioch" (Acts 18:22).

***Ekklesia*** can also mean something broad, like "*all* the followers of Jesus":

"And [God] put all things under [Jesus'] feet and gave him as head over all things to the ***ekklesia*** (Church)" (Eph. 1:22).

"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the ***ekklesia*** (Church) and gave himself up for her" (Eph. 5:25).

"And [Christ] is the head of the body, the ***ekklesia*** (Church). He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent" (Col. 1:18).

The first time we see ***ekklesia*** used in the New Testament is when Peter confesses that Jesus is the Christ:

"[Jesus] said to [the disciples], "But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my ***ekklesia*** (Church), and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matt. 16:15-19).

We see here that Peter confessed Jesus as Christ, and that Jesus said he would build *his* ***ekklesia*** (Church) on the rock of faith in Christ and on the foundation of apostolic teaching (Eph. 2:19-21) ([Chrysostom, Homily 54, par. 3](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/200154.htm)).

So, ***ekklesia*** can refer not only to one local church institution, but to the physical and spiritual assembly of *all* believers united in Christ and rooted in the teaching of the apostles. This is what the Reformers understood by "one holy, catholic and apostolic Church" ([Nicene Creed](/liturgy/creeds/nicene-creed-with-filioque)). The Greek word for "universal" is *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="katholikos" text="katholikos" />*, from which the word "catholic" is derived. The spiritual bond of *all* believers in Christ is what the Reformers thought of as the Church Universal, and this clearly isn't limited to one specific institution.

Later, Paul will identify the Church as "the body of Christ" (1 Cor. 12:12) (1 Cor. 12:27) (Col. 1:18).

## Testament

Becoming a follower of Jesus means accepting God's promise of the forgiveness of sins. It is not something to be taken lightly.

God's covenant relationship with man goes all the way back to the beginning. God created us, blessed us, and charged us to serve and help him rule in a deep spiritual bond with our creator (Gen. 1:26). When Noah was saved from the flood, he drew near to God with an offering, and God made a covenant with him (Gen. 9:11). When God made a covenant with Abraham, his faith was counted to him as righteousness (Gen. 15:5-6). God made a covenant with the people of Israel at Sinai through Moses (Ex. 24:7-8). This all culminates in Jesus, who at the Last Supper inaugurated a new testament in his blood for the forgiveness of sins (Matt. 26:27-28).

Thus, becoming a Christian means accepting God's grace and promise of the forgiveness of sins through Christ. It means dying to sin and being raised to new life in the Spirit through Baptism (Rom. 6:4). It means savoring God's mercy in that he would make us, who were dead in our trespasses, alive in Christ (Eph. 2:4-7). It means surrendering to Christ's Lordship, which in turn reconciles us to God (Rom. 5:1). Thus, the first step in our walk with Christ is Baptism, which is in fact what Jesus called us to do (Matt. 28:19-20).

## Word and Sacrament

*The Augsburg Confession* defines the Church as "the congregation of saints, in which the gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments are rightly administered" ([AC 7:1](https://bookofconcord.org/augsburg-confession/of-the-church/)). Martin Luther defined a sacrament as a promise of God's grace instituted by Christ which has a visible sign attached to it ([Luther, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church, p. 71](https://www.onthewing.org/user/Luther%20-%20Babylonian%20Captivity.pdf)).

The first sacrament we experience in the Church is Baptism (Matt. 28:19-20). Baptism is a sacrament in which God offers us the grace of salvation using the sign of water. Baptism inaugurates our entry into the family of God (John 3:5), and signifies our death and resurrection in Christ (Rom. 6:3-4).

The second sacrament we experience in the Church is the Lord's Supper (Luke 22:19-20). The Lord's Supper is a sacrament in which God offers us the grace of forgiveness using the sign of Christ's body and blood under the elements of bread and wine. In the Lord's supper we reaffirm Christ's promise to us of the forgiveness of sins and respond with thanksgiving (1 Cor. 11:26).

So, when we hear the word, the Holy Spirit works faith in our hearts. Then, God justifies us by grace through faith and calls us into his family through Christ. This bond is spiritual and individual at first, and makes us believers within the Church Universal. Then through the Sacraments, we are sealed within the body of Christ at the local church level. This inaugurates our entry into the family of God.

## Submission

It is important that our faith in Christ be more than just spiritual and individual. The Son had everything he needed in heaven, yet he lowered himself as man, even to the point of suffering and death for us and for our salvation. He fully and willingly submitted to the Father on our behalf in self-giving love. He became flesh, physically and locally in Israel. And while he forgives us and raises us up in glory to his spiritual altar, we ought to submit ourselves as he did in the service of others physically and locally. This is why local church matters. If we are to pick up our cross and follow Jesus (Matt. 16:24), we need to put flesh on our faith. Further, God *empowers* us to do so by graciously giving us spiritual gifts.

"But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it says, 'When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men.' (In saying, "He ascended," what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions, the earth? He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things)" (Eph. 4:7-10).

God captivates our hearts in Christ that we may repent and turn to him. He then forgives us and empowers us and gives us as gifts to the body of Christ, that we may exercise these gifts physically and locally. So that it is no longer us who work but Christ (Gal. 2:20). We become members of the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27), instruments of righteousness (Rom. 6:13), God's physical, tangible, working presence in the world, and it takes submitting in humble submission to do so.

## Elders

We mustn't only submit ourselves for the service of others, but also humble ourselves under the teaching of elders. The New Testament tells us that local churches were run by elders who were appointed by the Holy Spirit (Acts 20:28). Scripture tells us that we ought to submit ourselves not only to each other as brothers and sisters in Christ, but also to the elders (1 Peter 5:5). The elders then have the incredible responsibility of shepherding us responsibly, teaching the truth, and being accountable to God for our spiritual well being (Heb. 13:17). The elders must remember that though they are called to an important role, they are not the head of the body of Christ, Jesus is (Col. 1:18).

Just as the elders are to keep us accountable, we are to with great respect keep the elders accountable. The Bareans, for example, were counted as noble because they "received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so" (Acts 17:11)—"these things" being the preaching of Paul and Silas. Respectfully holding someone accountable, however, doesn't mean assuming lightly that they are false teachers, harshly criticizing them, or abandoning them. It is important to remember that man is fallible (Rom. 3:23), and that we are called to bear with one another in love (Eph. 4:1-2). That being said, Jesus himself did warn us of false teachers, whom he said we could identify by their fruit (Matt. 7:15-17), thus we should take seriously the important task of discerning which local church community we join and to which elders we submit.

## *Koinonia*

We have learned so far that as new believers we are justified by our faith in Christ, and called to partake in the Sacraments which inaugurate our entry into the family of God. At the same time we are empowered with spiritual gifts by God's grace which allow us to give ourselves unto others in self-sacrificing love, thereby becoming instruments of righteousness, not by our own might, but through Christ. So what happens now that we are in God's family physically and locally and not just spiritually and universally? The answer is ***<Definition lang="greek" anchor="koinonia" text="koinonia" />***.

The word ***koinonia*** in Greek means "fellowship", "communion", or "spiritual bond". ***Koinonia*** implies having a share in something or having a share with someone in something, or in other words it is a participation in something or participation with someone in something.

"And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the ***koinonia*** (fellowship), to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved" (Acts 2:42-47).

This is the kind of fellowship we see in the Bible. A participation in Christ. We join together in the Lord's Supper (1 Cor. 10:16), by God's grace we take part in acts of self-giving love (2 Cor. 8:3-4), and we share in Christ's suffering that we may share in everlasting life (Phil. 3:10-11).

## Unity

Being a part of God's family means you now have new brothers and sisters in Christ. Paul gives us an amazing summary of what life in the family of God looks like in his letter to the Ephesians. In the family of God we are called to stick together, serve together, and grow together with the common goal of Christ-likeness.

"I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call—one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all" (Eph. 4:1-6).

Paul knows that unity is difficult because of our sinful nature. He knows that life in the body of Christ is going to be difficult, that there will be conflict, and there will be hurt. So the first thing he calls us to is humility, gentleness, patience, and bearing with one another in love. Paul calls us to lay down our life as Christ did, and live in the Spirit, that we may maintain unity in the bond of peace. And this is not a superficial bond. We are not simply acquaintances in the same building, but rather we share the same Spirit of God dwelling in us and we have a deep bond through Christ our savior. It is true that we all have our differences, but a unity that can't survive differences is a weak unity. The unity of God's family is stronger than that. Paul calls us to stick together.

"But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it says, 'When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men.' (In saying, "He ascended," what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions, the earth? He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ" (Eph. 4:9-12).

God has graciously given us gifts in order to build us up for the work of serving the body of Christ; and he has given us all different gifts that we may work together and build each other up as we walk toward Christ-likeness together. Some of these gifts are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers themselves who laid the foundation of our faith, with Christ as the cornerstone (Eph. 2:19-21). Praise God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ for delighting in giving us such gifts, as if saving our souls wasn't enough. So let us use the gifts God has given us to build up the body of Christ. Paul calls us to serve together.

"…until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love" (Eph. 4:13-16).

Paul then gives us the reason we are to stick together and serve together. It's so that we *all* attain to the unity of the faith in Christ, becoming like him in every way; this is the common goal: Christ-likeness. When we become like him, we are no longer blown around by every falsehood we hear. Together we build each other up in love so that together we may hold fast to the truth and reach maturity. And the more we stick together and serve together, the more we build up the body in love. God isn't calling us only to individual spiritual growth, he is calling us to build up the body of Christ by his grace with humility and gentleness until we *all* become like him in every way. It does us no good to be really strong but separated from the body. Paul calls us to grow together.

## Conclusion

As believers, we are justified by our faith in Christ through his finished work on the cross, and are called into God's family through him. By hearing the word, the Holy Spirit works faith in us, and in accepting Christ's promise, we spiritually enter the Church Universal, which is not confined to one local institution. Our entry into the family of God is then inaugurated by confessing our faith (Rom. 10:10), discerning in which local church we are to participate, and partaking in the joy of the Sacraments, which are a sign and seal of God's testament, administered by the elders. We are then called to thoughtfully and intentionally lay down our lives in self-giving love for both the elders, who in turn take us into their fold and are accountable to God for us, and for our new brothers and sisters in Christ, with whom we participate and share in the life of Christ together. As a Christian, God calls us to stick together, serve together, and grow together, and empowers us with spiritual gifts which equip us for the work of ministry, that we may build up the body of Christ in love, with the common goal of Christ-likeness. We then continue to walk with Christ both individually and corporately until we are united with him more fully when he returns. Amen.
