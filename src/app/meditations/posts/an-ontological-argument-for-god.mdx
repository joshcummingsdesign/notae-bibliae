Ontology is the branch of metaphysics which deals with the study of being. The word "ontology" comes from the Greek word *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="ontos" text="ontos" />* which means "being". Ontological arguments derive from some source other than observation of the world, e.g. from reason alone. The first, and best-known, ontological argument for the existence of God was beautifully captured in the form of a prayer by St. Anselm of Canterbury in the 11th century in his *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="proslogium" text="Proslogion" />*.

> "Therefore, O Lord, who grants to faith understanding, grant unto me, so far as you know it to be expedient for me, that I may understand that you are as we believe; and also that you are what we believe you to be. And indeed we believe that you are that which nothing greater can be conceived. Is there then nothing real that can be thus described? For, 'The fool says in his heart: There is no God' (Ps. 14:1).

> Yet surely even that fool himself when he hears me speak of that which nothing greater can be conceived understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his understanding, even if he does not understand that it really exists. It is one thing for a thing to be in the understanding, and another to understand that the thing really exists.

> For when a painter considers the work which he is to make, he has it indeed in his understanding, but he does not yet understand it to be, as he has not yet made it. But when he has painted his picture, then he both has the picture in his understanding, and also understands it really to exist. Thus, even the fool is certain that something exists, at least in his understanding, which nothing greater can be conceived; because when he hears this mentioned, he understands it, and whatever is understood, exists in the understanding. And surely that which nothing greater can be conceived cannot exist only in the understanding. For if it indeed exists in the understanding only, it can be thought to exist also in reality; and real existence is greater than existence in the understanding only. Hence, if that which nothing greater can be conceived exists in the understanding only, then that which nothing greater can be conceived is that which something greater *can* be conceived: but this is impossible. Therefore, that which nothing greater can be conceived exists both in the understanding and also in reality."
