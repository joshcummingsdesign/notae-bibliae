**1st Century BC** — Cicero has an immense influence on Latin prose, rhetoric, philosophy, and political thought. His works shape the development of Latin as a literary language. Latin from this period is referred to as **Classical Latin**. The colloquial Latin spoken in this period is referred to as **Vulgar Latin**.

**2nd Century BC** — Vulgar Latin begins to evolve. The fricative "v" sound starts to be used in some places; the letters "ph" begin to make the "f" sound; the letters "ti" plus a vowel begin to make the "tsi" sound; and rustic speakers begin to convert the diphthongs "ae" and "oe" to "e", and the diphthong "au" to "o".

**4th Century** — St. Ambrose introduces Latin plainchant into the liturgical practice of the West.

**5th Century** — St. Jerome finishes his translation of the Vulgate. A <Definition lang="latin" anchor="schola-cantorum" text="Schola Cantorum" /> is founded in Rome. By the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Vulgar Latin begins to take on different pronunciations in different regions, Sardinian being the most conservative of these regional variants.

**6th Century** — Pope St. Gregory the Great collects and organizes Latin plainchant, and revitalizes the Schola Cantorum. Thus, Latin plainchant becomes known as Gregorian chant.

**9th Century** — Charlemagne hires Catholic scholar Alcuin of York to standardize Latin pronunciation using one sound for each letter. This form of Latin begins to sound more like Classical Latin than the regional variants of Vulgar Latin, and becomes known as **Ecclesiastical Latin.**

**14th Century** — The regional variants of Vulgar Latin are written down phonetically and eventually evolve into what become the Romance Languages: Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, and Romanian. Ecclesiastical Latin begins to take on different pronunciations in different regions, e.g. **Germanic Ecclesiastical Pronunciation** and **Italian Ecclesiastical Pronunciation**. Humanists like Petrarch spark a renewed interest in Classical Latin during the Renaissance.

**16th Century** — Erasmus revives the study of Classical Latin pronunciation.

**19th Century** — The study and restoration of Classical Latin pronunciation continues and results in what we now call **Restored Classical Pronunciation**.

**20th Century** — The influence of secular music on the Roman Catholic Church leads to a departure from Gregorian chant. In response, Pope Pius X restores Gregorian chant in 1903, and revives the Schola Cantorum, which begins to promote the use of the Italian Ecclesiastical Pronunciation.[^1] Thus, the Italian Ecclesiastical Pronunciation becomes the most widely used pronunciation in the Roman Catholic Church.
