## What Is Fasting?

By definition, fasting is abstaining from food or drink, but it's actually much more than that. Fasting is about mourning, repentance, earnest prayer, and a desire to draw near to God. It is a form of mortification, which is the act of subduing the desires of the flesh. Fasting focuses our mind on God, and reminds us of our reliance on him and how he sustains us. It is a way in which we imitate Christ in spiritual discipline and share in his sufferings. Fasting has a rich history in Scripture, and is full of meaning and significance.

## Why Do We Fast?

### To Draw Near to God

Moses fasted for 40 days when he received the Ten Commandments from God at Mt. Sinai (Ex. 34:28). Elijah fasted for 40 days before the Lord spoke to him in the same location (1 Kings 19:8). Daniel fasted for three weeks before God gave him a vision (Dan. 10:3). The church elders in Antioch had been fasting when the Holy Spirit directed them to send Paul and Barnabas on the first mission (Acts 13:2).

> "When we fast and pray, we are taking time away from a meal or an activity to devote our entire being to focus on God. We find we are more sensitive to the voice of God, more attuned to hearing what he has to reveal to us."

### To Remind Us of Our Reliance on God

In the Psalms, David reminds us that it is God who sustains us (Ps. 36:8-9). The Israelites were tested with hunger in the wilderness before God provided bread from heaven for them (Ex. 16:4). When Jesus was fasting in the wilderness, he reminded us that man doesn't live by bread alone (Matt. 4:4).

> **"And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord."**
>

### To Offer Ourselves in the Service of God

St. Paul reminds us that we are to present our bodies as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1), and St. Thomas Aquinas shows us that fasting is a way to do so.

> "A person can present his body to God as a sacrifice in three ways. First, when he exposes his body to suffering and death for God's sake, as it is said of Christ, 'Walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.' (Eph. 5:2), and as [Paul] says of himself, 'Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.' (Phil. 2:17). Second, when he weakens his body by fasts and watchings in the service of God, 'I discipline my body and keep it under control.' (1 Cor. 9:27). Third, when he uses his body to perform acts of justice and of divine worship, 'Present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.' (Rom. 6:19)."

### To Set Our Minds on the Spirit

Fasting helps us fight concupiscence, and helps us set our minds on the Spirit.

> **"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit."**
>
> <cite>Romans 8:5</cite>

### To Mourn, Repent, or Entreat God's Mercy

Fasting was done on the Day of Atonement for the repentance of sins (Lev. 16:29). David fasted to entreat God's mercy when his son became ill as a result of his sin (2 Sam. 12:16). Ezra fasted when mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles (Ezra 10:6).

> **"'Yet even now,' declares the Lord, 'return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.'"**
>
> <cite>Joel 2:12</cite>

### To Share in Christ's Sufferings

Jesus entered into our broken humanity, fasted for 40 days in the wilderness (Matt. 4:2-3), and ultimately bore our sins on the cross. Fasting is one of the ways in which we can respond in repentance and faith, and in a small way share in Christ's sufferings.

> **"But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed."**
>
> <cite>1 Peter 4:13</cite>

## What Are the Church's Traditional Fast Days?

The Church's traditional fast days are Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. In the 1st century, the *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="didakhe" text="Didache" />*—the first example of church orders—states, "Let not your fasts be with the hypocrites (cf. Matt. 6:16)—for they fast on the second and fifth day of the week—but fast on the fourth day and the day of preparation [before the Sabbath] (cf. Luke 23:54)."[^1] The Wednesday fast commemorates Christ's betrayal on Spy Wednesday, and the Friday fast commemorates his crucifixion on Good Friday. Over time, the Saturday fast came to be observed as a vigil, a time of watchful preparation for the celebration of Christ's resurrection on Sunday.

## What Should We Remember About Fasting?

It is important to remember that as with any offering unto the Lord, failing to observe its spiritual significance makes it merely empty ritual (Isa. 58:4-5).

Jesus encourages us to keep our fasting between God and ourselves, not to use it as an opportunity to show how religious we are (Matt. 6:17-18).

St. Thomas Aquinas provides an excellent summary of the purpose of fasting.

> "Fasting is practiced for a threefold purpose. First, in order to bridle the lusts of the flesh…For, according to Jerome, 'Venus is cold when Ceres and Bacchus are not there,' that is to say, lust is cooled by [abstaining from] meat and drink. Second, we have recourse to fasting in order that the mind may arise more freely to the contemplation of heavenly things, hence it is related of Daniel that he received a revelation from God after fasting for three weeks (Dan. 10:3). Third, in order to satisfy for sins, wherefore it is written, 'Return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.' (Joel 2:12). The same is declared by Augustine in a sermon, 'Fasting cleanses the soul, raises the mind, subjects one's flesh to the spirit, renders the heart contrite and humble, scatters the clouds of concupiscence, quenches the fire of lust, kindles the true light of chastity.'"

Rev. Daniel Merz also provides a beautiful summary of why we fast.

> "Christ…is the new Adam. At the beginning of his ministry in the Gospel of Matthew, we read, 'And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.' (Matt. 4:2). Hunger is that state in which we realize our dependence on something else—when we face the ultimate question: 'On what does my life depend?' Satan tempted both Adam and Christ, saying, 'Eat, for your hunger is proof that you depend entirely on food, that your life is in food.' Adam believed and ate. Christ said, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.' (Matt. 4:4). This liberates us from total dependence on food, on matter, on the world. Thus, for the Christian, fasting is the only means by which man recovers his true spiritual nature. In order for fasting to be effective, then, the Spirit must be a part of it. Christian fasting is not concerned with losing weight. It is a matter of prayer and the Spirit. And because of that, because it is truly a place of the Spirit, true fasting may well lead to temptation, and weakness and doubt and irritation. In other words, it will be a real fight between good and evil, and very likely we shall fail many times in these battles. But the very discovery of the Christian life as 'fight' and 'effort' is an essential aspect of fasting."
