## Hebrew Words

There are two words for "breath" in Hebrew, ***<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="neshama" text="neshama" />*** and ***<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="ruach" text="ruach" />***.
The word ***ruach*** can also mean "wind".

In Hebrew, both "breath" and "wind" can also mean "spirit".

Since these two words have many meanings, it's very important to look at the context in which each word is used to really understand what the Scripture is trying to tell us.

## Breath

- "A ***ruach*** (spiritual being) came forward and stood before the Lord" (1 Kings 22:21).

## Breath of Life

Examples:

- "[God] breathed into his nostrils the ***neshama*** (breath of life)" (Gen 2:7).
- "When you take away their ***ruach*** (breath of life), they die" (Ps. 104:29).

- "[God] will cause ***ruach*** (the breath of life) to enter you, and you shall live" (Eze. 37:5).

## Holy Spirit

The word ***ruach*** can also refer to the Holy Spirit, God's personal presence.

Examples:

- "The ***<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="elohim" text="ruach elohim" />*** (Holy Spirit) was hovering over the face of the waters" (Gen. 1:2).
- "[God] filled [Bezalel] with the ***ruach elohim*** (Holy Spirit)" (Ex. 31:3).

- "The ***ruach elohim*** (Holy Spirit) rushed upon [Saul], and he prophesied" (1 Sam. 10:10).

## Spirit vs. Soul

The word for "soul" in Hebrew is ***<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="nephesh" text="nephesh" />***.

The word soul is not to be confused with spirit. In the Bible, we do not *have* souls, we *are* souls.

We are a living being. We are that which has received the breath of life from God.
