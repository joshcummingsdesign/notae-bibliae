## Argument

In nature, we see that things change.

In order for any change to occur, there must be a final cause and an efficient cause.

- **Final Cause** – A potential, end, purpose, objective, or *<Definition lang="greek" anchor="telos" text="telos" />*
- **Efficient Cause** – An agent, actualizer, changer, or mover.

Without a final cause, there would be no reason for an efficient cause.

- If **A** is the efficient cause of **B**, that is because generating **B** is the final cause of **A**.
- If **A** were not so directed, there would be no reason why it is **B** that **A** generates rather than some other effect or no effect at all.

Without an efficient cause, there would be nothing to actualize a final cause.

- If **B** is the final cause of **A**, and **A** does not actualize **B**, no effect would be generated.

A thing doesn't exist prior to its actualization, therefore nothing is the efficient cause of itself.

- If **A** doesn't exist, it cannot actualize anything including itself.
- Therefore something else must actualize **A** before it can actualize anything else.

If there were no first efficient cause, nothing would exist.

- In nature we observe **B** as the result of **A**.
- If there were no first efficient cause to actualize **A**, **A** wouldn't exist.
- If **A** didn't exist, there would be nothing to actualize **B**, and **B** wouldn't exist.
- If there were no **A** and **B**, nothing would exist.

If there were no first final cause, only the first efficient cause would exist.

- In nature we observe **B** as the result of **A**.
- If the first efficient cause didn't have **A** as its first final cause, the first efficient cause wouldn't actualize **A,** and **A** wouldn't exist.
- If **A** didn't exist, there would be nothing to actualize **B**, and **B** wouldn't exist.
- If there were no **A** and **B**, you would simply have the first efficient cause and nothing more.

Therefore we must arrive at a **first efficient cause**, to which we give the name God, and a **first final cause**, to which we give the name creation.

## **Implications**

- A first efficient cause can be caused by no other, therefore it cannot change.
- Because a first efficient cause cannot be changed, it cannot be material and must be outside of time and space.
- For a first efficient cause to have a first final cause, it must be all-knowing.
- For a first efficient cause to actualize everything else in the universe, it must be all-powerful.

## **Objections**

- What if there is no such thing as final causality?

  - If that were the case, human reason itself would have no final cause.
  - If that were the case, human reason wouldn't have the attainment of truth as its final cause.
  - If that were the case, there would be no difference between good reasoning and bad reasoning.
  - Therefore you would end up with a self-defeating position.
- What if there are just brute facts and no first cause?

  - If you concede that there are brute facts which have no explanation at all, you would be conceding that the world is ultimately unintelligible.
  - If you concede that the world is ultimately unintelligible, there would be no purpose for human reason and you would again end up with a self-defeating position.
- Why couldn't we just allow for a vicious regress such that every efficient cause relies on another ad infinitum?

  - If there weren't something at the beginning of a series of changes, you wouldn't have a complete explanation of the change you observed. You would either be continuously deferring the explanation, or would be conceding that there is no explanation at all.
  - If you concede that there is no explanation at all, you would be conceding that the world is ultimately unintelligible.
  - If you concede that the world is ultimately unintelligible, there would be no purpose for human reason and you would again end up with a self-defeating position.
