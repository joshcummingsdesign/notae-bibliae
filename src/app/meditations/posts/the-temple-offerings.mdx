## Korban — Offering

In Hebrew, the word *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="korban" text="korban" />* means "offering" and comes from the root word *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="karav" text="karav" />* which means "to draw near", thus *korban* indicates a desire to draw near to God.

In the days of the *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="mishkan" text="mishkan" />*, there were five main types of *korban*:

1. *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="olah" text="Olah" />* — Burnt Offering
2. *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="minkha" text="Minkha" />* — Grain Offering
3. *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="shelem" text="Shelem" />* — Peace Offering
4. *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="khatat" text="Khatat" />* — Sin Offering
5. *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="asham" text="Asham" />* — Guilt Offering

Three of the offerings were voluntary expressions of worship (*olah*, *minkha*, and *shelem*), and two were mandatroy expressions of remorse for sin (*khatat*, and *asham*).

## Olah — Burnt Offering

In Hebrew, *olah* means "that which goes up or ascends", and refers to a burnt offering. It was a freewill offering which was to be burnt up entirely (Lev. 1:9). This symbolized offering one's entire self in the service of God. The offering had to be from the herd (a bull, sheep, or goat) or from the flock (a turtledove or pigeon). If it was from the herd, it had to be a male without blemish. One was to bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting where the priest would inspect it to make sure it was acceptable to present before God, and speak with the person to make sure their offering was sincere. It would then be accepted for the offerer to make atonement for him, and the offerer would approach the north side of the altar and lay his hands upon the animal, pressing upon it, to identify with it and acknowledge that it is a substitute for him (Lev. 1:3-4). The offerer would then kill the animal, and the priest would throw the blood on the sides of the altar (Lev. 1:5). The blood represents the life which covered for the offerer to make atonement (Lev. 17:11). The head and the fat, the fat representing the best part of the meat offered only unto God, were placed on the altar, but the animal's legs (which represents our actions) and innards (which represents our thoughts and passions) were washed with water (Lev. 1:12-13). When the offering was burned upon on the altar, the smoke that ascended represented God's acceptance of the offering. Additionally, the man of the house brought the offering on behalf of himself and his family, so the smoke allowed the family outside the tabernacle court to see that God had accepted their offering. If someone was not wealthy enough to offer from the herd, he would offer a turtledove or pigeon (Lev. 1:14), thus everyone was able to draw near to God.

In Rabbi Rafi Mallot's paraphrase of Nachmanides' commentary on Genesis 8:20-21, he says:

> "The simple explanation of the main purpose of the offerings is that they demonstrate one's wholehearted desire to fulfill God's will. That is to say, one offers himself—his will, his desire, and everything he has—with all his heart to the service of God. His only desire is to hold fast to God. Just as one desires to bring an offering to God's physical altar, so too he desires to ascend upon God's spiritual altar. The steadfast love and faithfulness which is born in the heart of the one drawing near *is* the pleasing aroma to the Lord."

## Minkha — Grain Offering

In Hebrew, *minkha* means "gift" or "tribute" and refers to a meal or grain offering. The grain offering represented all that the worshiper had, and often times it was, as the grain could have been used to make their next meal. This is why it says when any "soul" (Hebrew: *<Definition lang="hebrew" anchor="nephesh" text="nephesh" />*) brings a grain offering (Lev. 2:1). For a poor person, this offering represented their life. This is why the grain offering was considered most holy (Lev. 2:3). It was to be of fine flour that the family ground up on stone, and mixed with oil and frankincense. The priest would offer a memorial portion unto the Lord, and the rest would be for the priests. The priests had the important responsibility of being good stewards of that which was offered to God in the service of the tabernacle, and having no land inheritance, they completely relied on God and his people to be sustained. The grain offering could also consist of baked unleavened loaves of bread mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, or unleavened bread cooked in a pan with oil. It would be baked at home and brought to the priest who would offer the memorial portion and keep the rest to sustain the priests. Leaven and honey were prohibited as they would "puff up" the bread. The grain offerings would always be offered with salt, as salt represented the covenant between God and his people. In ancient Near-Eastern culture, covenants were sealed with a meal, and salt was used to symbolize the preservation of the agreement. If the offering was of the firstfruits of the grain harvest, it had a special significance because it represented trusting the Lord for the next harvest. In this case, the grain was to be roasted and crushed, and oil and frankincense were to be put upon it.

## Shelem — Peace Offering

In Hebrew, *shelem* means "peace offering" and refers to an offering of thanksgiving. Thanksgiving refers to gratitude for an unexpected blessing or deliverance, and was sometimes accompanied by a vow (Ps. 56:12-13). *Shelem* could also be a freewill offering which expressed gratitude without any specific blessing or deliverance. The offerer was to take baked unleavened loaves of bread mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and unleavened bread cooked in a pan with oil (Lev. 7:11-12). He was to also bring an animal, male or female without blemish, from the herd or from the flock (Lev. 3:1). The offerer would approach the north side of the altar, lay his hands upon the animal in gratitude, and kill it. The priest would throw the blood on the sides of the altar. The fat (the choicest part) and the innards (representing our thoughts and passions) were removed, and the breast (another choice part) and the fat were waved as a wave offering before the Lord. The fat and innards were burned on the altar (Lev. 3:3-5). The meat, along with one of each type of bread, was offered as a gift unto the Lord first before the meal was shared with the priests (Lev. 7:14). The right thigh (a symbol of strength) was for the priest, and the breast (a symbol of love) was for the priest's family (Lev. 7:31-33). The offering was to be eaten that day, but if it was a vow or freewill offering, any leftovers by chance could be eaten the next day. On the third day, however, the consecrated food was to be burned up with fire (Lev. 7:15-18).

## Khatat — Sin Offering

In Hebrew, *khatat* means "sin offering". In his commentary on Leviticus, Nachmanides offers a clear explanation of the meaning of the sin offering.

> "Since man's actions are accomplished through thought, word and deed, God commanded that when man sins and brings an offering, he should lay his hands upon it in contrast to the [evil] deed [committed]. He should confess his sin verbally in contrast to his [evil] speech, and he should burn the innards and the kidneys [of the offering] in fire because they are the instruments of thought and desire in the human being. He should burn the legs [of the offering] since they correspond to the hands and feet of a person, which do all his work. He should sprinkle the blood upon the altar, which is analogous to the blood in his body. All these acts are performed in order that when they are done, a person should realize that he has sinned against his God with his body and his soul, and that *his* blood should really be spilled and *his* body burned, were it not for the lovingkindness of the Creator, Who took from him a substitute and a ransom, namely this offering, so that its blood should be in place of his blood, its life in place of his life, and that the chief limbs of the offering should be in place of the chief parts of his body. The portions [given from the sin-offering to the priests], are in order to support the teachers of the Torah, so that they pray on his behalf. The reason for the daily public offering is that it is impossible for the public [as a whole] to continually avoid sin."

Rabbi Rafi Mallot provides a nice summary of what Nachmanides is saying here.

> "What Nachmanides is describing is a catharsis. It's as if the offerer is saying, 'What have I done? I've rebelled against my God, my Creator, my merciful Master. How could I have done so bad to he who has done such good to me?' Then he goes through the action of offering the animal, which resembles the human being in its division of limbs, and he is meant to understand that because of his actions, there ought to be this consequence upon him. But God in his mercy is allowing it to be transferred onto the animal so that he should have a catharsis and come to the realization of what he did wrong and repair his relationship with God."

The thoughtful process behind the offerings is critically important (Ps. 51:17). The prophets made it clear that when one disregarded the meaning of the offerings, they became an abomination (Mal. 1:7-10).

## Asham — Guilt Offering

In Hebrew, *asham* means "guilt offering". While the guilt offering is very similar to the sin offering, there is one major distinction. The guilt offering dealt with making restitution to the one who was harmed as a result of the sin committed (Lev. 5:16).
