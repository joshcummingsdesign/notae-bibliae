In the 16th century, Martin Luther and his followers ceased observing the feast of Corpus Christi. The primary reason was that the laity were being deprived of Communion in both kinds, which Luther believed divided the very people the Lord intended to unite in the Sacrament. For this reason, Luther felt that the Corpus Christi processions were disingenuous, and that proper adoration of the Sacrament was to be freely exercised within the ordinance instituted by Christ.

In 1535, Luther delivered a sermon on Luke:14:15-17, a passage which the Catholic Church had interpreted to justify withholding Communion in both kinds from the laity.

> "The Papists, contrary to the order of the ancient Church, have appointed this Gospel lesson for the First Sunday after Trinity, because they celebrated it the week during the festival of Corpus Christi, as is still the custom among them. For they interpreted the supper, of which this Gospel speaks, to signify the Sacrament of the Altar, and thereby desired to establish the Communion in one part or form only, which, as you well know, is one of their chief abuses..."

To Luther, withholding Communion in both kinds created a significant disparity between priests and the laity, a disparity which was then paraded about in the processions of Corpus Christi.

> "They do [the processions] that they themselves may thereby be honored, namely, that the distinction be maintained, that the order of priests is a more special and a higher order before God, than the common order of Christians; because the priests alone receive the entire Sacrament…and other Christians, as people of a lower order, must be satisfied with only one part of the Sacrament."

Luther insisted that Christ's intention for the Sacrament was not to divide his people, but unite them.

> "For how does it happen that the Holy Sacrament must be used to make a distinction among Christians? Whereas Christ our Lord instituted it chiefly for the comfort of the conscience and for the strengthening of our faith, and further that Christendom should be like a bond, by which Christians are bound together in the most intimate manner; that they be as one bread or one loaf, not only that they might have in common and at the same time one God, one Word, one Baptism, one Sacrament, one hope, one confidence, and all the grace and treasures of Christ in common; but that in their external life they are also one body, where one member assists, serves, helps, advises and sympathizes with the others."

It is important to note that Eucharistic adoration was not inherently problematic in Luther's view, but he did caution that it could easily overshadow the true purpose and intent of the Sacrament and the great comfort it provides.

> "[Christ] is present in the Sacrament and in the hearts of believers not really because he wants to be worshiped there, but because he wants there to work with us and help us; just as he also came to earth in the flesh not that men should worship him, but to serve us, as he himself said, 'I have not come to be served but to serve and to give my life for many' (Matt. 20:28)."

That being said, Luther in no way throws the baby out with the bathwater.

> "But from this it does not follow that one should not worship him. For many people worshiped him when he was upon earth and he accepted it too, such as the three kings at the manger (Matt. 2:11), the blind man (John 9:38), and many others. Nevertheless, his state at that time was not yet the state of his honor and glory, for which nothing but worship and adoration is fitting."

Ultimately, Luther wanted Christians to experience the true comfort and joy of the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar as he believed Christ intended, and cautioned against creating unnecessary divisions—even divisions regarding Eucharistic adoration.

> "One should not condemn people or accuse them of heresy if they do not adore the Sacrament, for there is no command to that effect and it is not for that purpose that Christ is present. Just as we read that the apostles did not adore the Sacrament since they were sitting and eating at table (Matt. 26:26-30). On the other hand, one should not condemn and accuse of heresy people who do adore the Sacrament. For although Christ has not commanded it, neither has he forbidden it, but often accepted it. Free, free it must be, according as one is disposed in his heart and has opportunity. Therefore both parties are to be blamed when they take a stand on either of these two sides and quarrel over this matter and condemn one another, and both of them miss the middle way."
