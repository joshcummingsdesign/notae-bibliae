In this article, I will provide a high-level overview of five key moments in the Reformation to help us better understand the rationale behind Protestantism. The five key moments are as follows:

1. The East-West Schism
2. The Excommunication of Martin Luther
3. The Establishment of the Lutheran Church
4. The East's Rejection of Protestants
5. The Protestants' Reexamination of Christendom

## 1. The East-West Schism

In 330, Constantine moved the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Constantinople.[^1] The 5th century marked the impending fall of the Western Roman Empire.[^2] In 451, the Council of Chalcedon introduced a canon which acknowledged Rome's primacy of honor, and elevated Constantinople to second after Rome, though the Roman delegates and Pope St. Leo the Great rejected this canon.[^3] In the 6th century, the bishop of Constantinople assumed the title "Ecumenical Patriarch", which angered Pope St. Gregory the Great.[^4] Around this time, the Western Church began adding the *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="filioque" text="Filioque" />* to the Nicene Creed in attempts to combat Arianism.[^5] The Eastern Church not only disagreed with the theology, but took offense that this was done outside of an ecumenical council.[^6] In the 9th century, the papacy crowned its own emperor, Charlemagne, who aided in the expansion of papal authority in the West.[^7] In the 11th century, the Normans flooded into Byzantine-controlled southern Italy and began using the Latin rite in worship, which created conflict with the local Byzantine citizens.[^8][^9] The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius, and his followers began to criticize the Latin rite, especially with regards to the *Filioque* and the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist, the latter which they viewed as a form of Judaizing. When Cerularius began to close down the Latin rite churches in Constantinople, Pope Leo IX sent a delegation led by Cardinal Bishop Humbert of Silva Candida to meet with Cerularius.[^10][^11] When Cerularius refused to meet with the legates, Humbert issued a bull of excommunication against him in 1054.[^12] In response, Cerularius convened a synod to excommunicate the legates.[^13]

From this we can see that there were three issues which contributed to the East-West Schism:

1. Papal supremacy
2. The *Filioque*
3. Unleavened bread in the Eucharist

We will set papal supremacy aside for the time being, as it is a shared concern for Protestants; but as for the theology of the *Filioque*, the East's claim that it is heretical is a hard case to make. None of the seven ecumenical councils anathematize it, it can be defended biblically (John 15:26) (John 20:22) (Acts 2:33), it is spoken of by such Church Fathers as St. Augustine and St. Ambrose,[^14][^15] and it is found in the [Athanasian Creed](/liturgy/creeds/athanasian-creed).

The claim that the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist is heretical is also a hard case to make. None of the seven ecumenical councils anathematize it, and neither the Bible nor the Church Fathers are explicit on the matter. Nevertheless, the East's view that the Western Church had fallen into heresy persisted throughout the Reformation, and continues even today.

## 2. The Excommunication of Martin Luther

Martin Luther was an ordained Catholic priest who was called to a teaching office and took vows to teach the word of God faithfully.[^16] When he encountered what he and others believed to be critical errors in the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, he had a choice: deny his ordination vows and yield to the authority of the pope, or cling to the authority of the Scriptures and enumerate his concerns. Luther chose the latter.

The most important issue Luther sought to address was papal supremacy. The Church had always been conciliar (Acts 15:22), and the seven ecumenical councils clearly outlined that bishops were only to have jurisdiction over their own region;[^17] but in the Middle Ages, Rome not only claimed to have universal jurisdiction, but supreme authority over both spiritual and temporal matters.[^18] Luther pointed out that Rome had built "three walls" around themselves: 1. When pressed by the temporal power, they made decrees that the temporal power had no jurisdiction over them; 2. When pressed by argumentation from the Scriptures, they raised the objection that the interpretation of the Scriptures belonged to the pope alone; and 3. When pressed by church councils, they answered that no one could call a church council but the pope.[^19]

The Reformation came to a head when Rome began to deprive the laity of Communion in both kinds,[^20] sell indulgences,[^21] and brutally persecute proto-Protestant groups such as the Hussites and the Waldensians.[^22][^23] In 1520, Martin Luther wrote three key Reformation writings, *An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility*, *The Babylonian Captivity of the Church*, and *A Treatise on Christian Liberty*. In 1521, he was ordered by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to appear before the Diet of Worms to recant. Unwilling to do so, he was excommunicated.[^24]

Ultimately, Rome claimed that the keys of St. Peter belonged to them exclusively, and left no room for biblical argumentation. Those who argued biblically were excommunicated, imprisoned, or executed.

## 3. The Establishment of the Lutheran Church

Having been excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, Martin Luther and his fellow reformers were now faced with an important question: could the ordained presbyters among them perform valid ordinations, or were ordinations only valid when performed by a bishop? The Lutheran theologians came to the conclusion with historical evidence that the office of bishop—as distinct from the presbyters—developed out of human delegation rather than divine ordinance, and that it was not without precedent for the presbyters among them to ordain their own bishop, so long as he was regularly called, i.e. called to the ministry through the church body and not by claims of an extraordinary call by God directly.[^25][^26][^27]

## 4. The East's Rejection of Protestants

The early Lutherans recognized the concerns they shared with the Eastern Orthodox Church regarding overreaching papal authority.[^28] Moreover, the early Lutherans held that traditions instituted by men need not be everywhere alike.[^29] The East, however, had already claimed that the West had fallen into heresy, and by extension, that also meant the Protestants.

In 1575, a group of Lutheran theologians from Tübingen, including Jakob Andreae, sent a Greek version of the *The Augsburg Confession* to Patriarch of Constantinople Jeremias II in attempts to open an ecumenical dialog. This led to a theological correspondence which took place between 1576 and 1581, in which both sides sent three letters each. Much agreement was found, however, the two sides could not reach an accord on the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, the nature of free will, the nature of justification, the number of sacraments, praying to the saints, and the veneration of icons.

Jeremias urged the scholars of Tübingen to abandon their "innovations" and embrace the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Lutheran theologians, however, defended their position, insisting that their teachings were not innovations, but were grounded in Holy Scripture. In response, Jeremias denounced the Lutheran theologians as heretics and requested that they cease all correspondence with him on matters of doctrine.[^30][^31]

The East's disdain for Protestants continued on into the modern period. The 19th-century Eastern Orthodox saint, Theophan the Recluse, described Protestants as being products of "the second degree of the fall into falsehood and darkness," the first degree being Rome's "falling away from the faith."[^32]

## 5. The Protestants' Reexamination of Christendom

Though Luther and his contemporaries were estranged from Rome and the East, they never abandoned their love of God. When all the doors seemed to close, and the hour seemed dark and dreary, they pressed on, guided by the light of Christ. Though it seemed all the world thought them sinners, they thought the world redeemable in Christ. They affirmed with the Fathers that the holy Church is one (united in faith by the Holy Spirit),[^33] catholic (scattered throughout the world),[^34] and apostolic (built on the foundation of the apostles with Christ as the chief cornerstone) (Eph. 2:20). They reexamined Christendom with a posture of charity, and affirmed that traditions instituted by men need not be everywhere alike.[^35] They boldly proclaimed that we are united by a common salvation by grace through faith.[^36]

## Conclusion

I pray that through thoughtful study, the rationale behind Protestantism becomes clearer to those who desire to understand their separated brethren. I pray that increased understanding causes faith, hope, and charity to abound, which in turn leads to a deeper sense of unity. I pray that the Lord create for us opportunities for ecumenical dialog and earnest and irenic discussion regarding all matters of disagreement. Lastly, I pray that as brothers and sisters in Christ we "make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace" (Eph. 4:1-3).

Amen.
