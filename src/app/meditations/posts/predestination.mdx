In eternity, before the foundation of the world, God had the final cause of the universe in his mind. God's ordering wisdom and care is called **providence** ([ST I, q. 22, a. 1, co., par. 1](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q22.A1.C)). As an act of pure grace, God determined that man's last end would be eternal life with him ([ST I-II, q. 3, a. 4, s.c.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q3.A4.SC)). In his wisdom, God also determined that man should have free will ([ST I, q. 83, a. 1, co.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q83.A1.C)), that he may freely love God and rely on his grace to attain to his last end ([ST I-II, q. 109, a. 5, s.c.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q109.A5.SC)).

God foresaw, however, that in giving man free will, one would be able to refuse the gift of his grace ([ST I-II, q. 111, a. 2, ad. 2](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q111.A2.Rep2)). He foresaw that this would happen with our first parents, and anticipated that man would enter into a fallen state, unable to save himself nor attain to his last end ([ST I-II, q. 109, a. 7, co., par. 1](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q109.A7.C)). Thus in eternity, God planned for our salvation through Christ ([Eph. 1:3-5). Through Christ, God once again offers his gift of grace to all, as the work of Christ is sufficient to save all of humanity from their fallen state (John 3:16) (1 Tim. 2:3-4).

God again foresaw man's struggle with free will, and therefore knew that some would accept his offer of salvation and some would refuse it (ST I, q. 23, a. 3, co.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I.Q23.A3.C)). Those who accept his offer of salvation are called the **elect** ([Rom. 8:33). The technical term for those who refuse his offer of salvation is the **reprobate**.

This whole scenario describes what is called **predestination**, and it is important to note that at no point in eternity did God predestine sin ([ST I-II, q. 79, a. 1, co.](https://aquinas.cc/la/en/~ST.I-II.Q79.A1.C)). He simply desired that we accept the gift of his grace and salvation, and accounted for man's refusal of grace and misuse of free will. Thus, if we are saved, we cannot say it is our own doing, and if we sin, we cannot say it is God's doing.

> "When I am able to cooperate with Christ, I give the praise to the Holy Spirit because God has given me the grace to be faithful. If I sin, it wasn't because God didn't give me the grace necessary. I take responsibility because it's me who turned away from the light. I turned my mind away from the light and I let my will submit to the seductions of what's lesser, and I loved what was not God more than what was God. I then need to go back and reflect more deeply on the mercy of God."
