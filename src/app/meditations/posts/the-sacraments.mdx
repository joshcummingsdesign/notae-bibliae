*The Augsburg Confession* defines the church as "the congregation of saints, in which the gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments are rightly administered" ([AC 7:1](https://bookofconcord.org/augsburg-confession/of-the-church/)). But what is a sacrament? The word "sacrament" comes from the Latin word *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="sacramentum" text="sacramentum" />* which means "mystery", "oath", or "pledge". It is related to the Latin word *<Definition lang="latin" anchor="sacer" text="sacer" />* which means "sacred" or "holy". St. Augustine defined a sacrament as a visible sign of an invisible grace.[^1] He also explained that in the Sacraments, one thing is seen, and another is to be understood, saying, "What can be seen has a bodily appearance, what is to be understood provides spiritual fruit."[^2] Luther defined a sacrament as a promise of God's grace instituted by Christ which has a visible sign attached to it.[^3]

> "This is surely true, that to every promise of his, God usually adds some sign as a memorial or remembrance of the promise, so that thereby we may serve him the more diligently and he may admonish us the more effectually. Thus, when he promised Noah that he would not again destroy the world by a flood, he added his bow in the clouds, to show that he would be mindful of his covenant. And after promising Abraham the inheritance in his seed, he gave him circumcision as a mark of his justification by faith. Thus he granted to Gideon the dry and the wet fleece to confirm his promise of victory over the Midianites. And through Isaiah he offered to Ahaz a sign that he would conquer the king of Syria and Samaria, to confirm in him his faith in the promise. And we read of many such signs of the promises of God in the Scriptures.
>
> So in the [Lord's Supper] also, the foremost promise of all, he adds as a memorial sign of such a great promise his own body and his own blood in the bread and wine, when he says: 'Do this in remembrance of me.' And so in Baptism, to the words of promise he adds the sign of immersion in water. We may learn from this that in every promise of God two things are presented to us, the word and the sign, so that we are to understand the word to be the testament, but the sign to be the sacrament."

While the question of how many sacraments Christ instituted under the new testament has long been debated, Luther's definition points us to two undisputed graces that God has given the church: [Baptism](/meditations/baptism) and the [Lord's Supper](/meditations/the-lords-supper) ([AAC 7:4](https://bookofconcord.org/defense/of-the-number-and-use-of-sacraments/#ap-xiii-0004)). These two sacraments have always been treated with a special reverence, and truly are visible signs of invisible grace.

In summary, sacraments are profound gifts and spiritual blessings from God which stir up our faith and love for Christ. They are the spiritual truths of the gospel made tangible, and God is at work in and through them. They are God's visible holy covenantal signs and seals. They are symbols of unity.
