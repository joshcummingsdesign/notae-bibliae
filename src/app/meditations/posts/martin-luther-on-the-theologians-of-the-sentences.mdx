<Initial text="Martin Luther on the Theologians of the Sentences"/>

Luther felt that the scholastic theologians of his day had become so preoccupied with Aristotelian philosophy that they had lost sight of the main focus of the Lord’s Supper, that is, faith in the word of promise. His words regarding them remind us, even today, what it means to hold fast to the promises of God when we come to the Lord’s table.

> “Here you may see what ‘great things’ our theologians of the Sentences have produced in this matter. In the first place, not one of them treats of that which is first and foremost, namely, the testament and the word of promise. And thus they make us forget faith and the whole power of the [Lord’s Supper]. In addition, they discuss exclusively the second part of the [Lord’s Supper], namely, the sign or sacrament; yet in such a way that here too they do not teach faith, but their preparations…opera operata…and ‘fruits of the Mass’. They come then to the ‘profundities’ (babble of transubstantiation and endless other metaphysical trivialities), destroy the proper understanding and use of both sacrament and testament (together with faith as such), and cause Christ’s people to forget their God—as the prophet says, ‘days without number’ (Jer. 2:32). Let the others tabulate the various benefits of hearing Mass; you just apply your mind to this…say and believe with the prophet that God has here prepared a table before you in the presence of your enemies (Ps. 23:5) at which your faith may feed and grow fat. But your faith is fed only with the word of divine promise, for ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’ (Deut. 8:3) (Matt. 4:4). Hence, in the [Lord’s Supper] you must pay closest heed above all to the word of promise, as to a most lavish banquet—your utterly green pastures and sacred still waters (Ps. 23:2)—in order that you might esteem this word above everything else, trust in it supremely, and cling to it most firmly, even through death and all sins. If you do this, you will obtain not merely those tiny drops and crumbs of [the] ‘fruits of the Mass’—which some have superstitiously invented—but the very fountainhead of life, namely, faith in the Word, out of which every good thing flows; as is said in John 7:38, ‘He who believes in me, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.’ And again, ‘Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him, it will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.’ (John 4:14).”
