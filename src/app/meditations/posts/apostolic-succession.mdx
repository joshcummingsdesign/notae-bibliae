The apostles along with the prophets are the foundation of the Church with Christ as the cornerstone (Eph. 2:19-22). The apostles were disciples sent by Jesus to carry out the work of the ministry (Matt. 10:1-4). After his resurrection, Jesus commissioned them to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19-20); and so baptize they did (Acts 2:41). The apostles had the incredible responsibility of faithfully teaching and being good stewards of God's word, which they heard first hand from Jesus himself. Soon the apostolic teaching began to spread (Acts 2:42), and they ordained others to aid them in accomplishing their mission (Acts 6:3-6).

The apostles and evangelists, looking to preserve the fullness of truth, recorded their eyewitness accounts of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, and in the Spirit wrote letters to the Church offering teaching, wisdom, and correction. The Church carefully preserved these sacred writings, which, by divine providence, were received into the canon of Holy Scripture. This is what we today call the New Testament (2 Tim. 3:16-17).

After the apostles had fallen asleep, their disciples, the Church Fathers, fought vehemently throughout the centuries to preserve the apostolic teaching. Their teachings, sermons, and biblical commentaries have been preserved, and by the grace of God we still have access to them today.

The unbroken chain of ordination from the apostles to their successors is known as apostolic succession. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches teach that it is only a bishop who can perform valid ordinations to maintain apostolic succession, however, many historians argue that in the early church, the office of bishop—as distinct from the presbyters—developed out of human delegation rather than divine ordinance, and that it is not without precedent that in special circumstances the presbyters can perform ordinations.[^1] Ordinarily, however, it is the bishop who performs ordinations.

Apostolic succession is a way for a church to validate its ministry, and while its necessity is often debated, it connects us to the historical faith, and offers a beautiful fittingness of continuity.
