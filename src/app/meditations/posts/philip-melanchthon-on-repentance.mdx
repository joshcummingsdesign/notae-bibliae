In 1530, the Second Diet of Augsburg was held, and a Lutheran confession written primarily by Philip Melanchthon in both German and Latin was presented to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. This is known as *The Augsburg Confession*. In response, the Roman Catholic Church issued a refutation which was met with Charles' approval. Melanchthon then responded with the *Apology of the Augsburg Confession*.

In the 12th article of *The Augsburg Confession*, the Lutherans put forth that those who sin post Baptism receive absolution after they repent, and that repentance consists of two parts: contrition and faith. The former they defined as "terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin," and the latter they defined as "[belief] that for Christ's sake [one's] sins are forgiven," and that this belief "comforts the conscience and delivers it from terrors."[^1] The Roman Catholic Church rejected the latter claim in favor of the doctrine of penance.[^2]

In the corresponding article in the *Apology of the Augsburg Confession*, Melanchthon beautifully articulates the assurance of forgiveness we have in Christ, and does so at a time when many in the Church were uncertain of their standing before God.

> "Therefore, let pious consciences know that the command of God is this, that they believe that they are freely forgiven for Christ's sake, and not for the sake of our works. And by this command of God let them sustain themselves against despair, and against the terrors of sin and of death…For [[St. Bernard](/people/saints/medieval/bernard-of-clairvaux)] says the same thing in words that are in no way obscure, 'For it is necessary first of all to believe that you cannot have remission of sins except by the indulgence of God, but add yet that you believe also this, namely, that through him sins are forgiven thee. This is the testimony which the Holy Ghost asserts in your heart (Rom. 8:16), saying: Thy sins are forgiven thee (Matt. 9:2). For thus [[St. Paul](/people/saints/apostles/paul)] judges that man is justified freely through faith (Rom. 3:23-28).'[^3] These words of Bernard shed a wonderful light upon our cause, because he not only requires that we in a general way believe that sins are remitted through mercy, but he bids us add special faith, by which we believe that sins are remitted even to us; and he teaches how we may be rendered certain concerning the remission of sins, namely, when our hearts are encouraged by faith, and become tranquil through the Holy Ghost."
