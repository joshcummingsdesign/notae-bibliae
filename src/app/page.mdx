## What is Notae Bibliae?

"As the name implies, Notae Bibliae started as a place for me to store my Bible study notes, but over time became the place to which I returned every day in awe and reverence, attempting—even if only ever so slightly—to capture the meaning and the beauty and the majesty of God's word. As one who came to the faith later in life, I began to write down the things that I wished someone would have shared with me as a new believer, and over time, a fire was lit in my heart, fervent study ensued, and Notae Bibliae expanded to include resources on history and holy tradition. I am a lay theologian, likely to err, and I claim no authority of my own, but I pray that the words on this site touch your heart, inspire you, and build you up in the faith. May the grace and the peace of the Lord be with you always."
